| 0:11:13| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| I just want to follow up with the question that I asked at the last board meeting regarding if this money can or cannot be used for community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=677)|
| 0:11:27| Mr. McPherson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| There is nothing that we have seen in any guidance or any extra guidance that provides funding for community nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=690)|
| 0:11:39| Again, there's nothing that would – that's not to say there may be other government sources out there for community nonprofits, just not with extra funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=699)|
| 0:11:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Any other questions while he's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Thanks, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Mr. McPherson, can you – I think it's important to note for the public that, as was stated last time, that the approval of this that we're considering is the acceptance of these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=717)|
| 0:12:07| and the budget that's attached is preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| So, can you give a little more description of what we're actually doing tonight with this on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| We are requesting the board approve the receipt of the funds, which is what we do with other federal grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| Typically, the way federal grants work, or at least it has in the past, and normally we think of Title I and IDEA, which they're just pretty normal top items year after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=742)|
| 0:12:36| We will get approval from the board in receipt of those funds and then also approval for the application to be used – or how those funds are to be used, so the application to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=756)|
| 0:12:48| Rather than kind of doing it backwards that way, we thought it was important to bring at least the preliminary proposal before we applied to the state on what our thought was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=768)|
| 0:13:01| so the board could weigh in on that because these are a lot of – it's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| We didn't want to apply for it, the intended use of these funds, without first taking it to the board to make sure the board was – the intended use was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=785)|
| 0:13:16| Is it – even though this is the recommendation, is it still fair to say that the board still would have leeway in a future date to help adjust – or make a recommendation to adjust this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=796)|
| 0:13:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| We can request budgetary adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| That's acceptable with federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| I do have another question, but not for Mr. McPherson, so if you want to see if anybody else –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Do you have one for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| I mean, I've gotten several emails, I'm assuming other board members have, about, you know, obviously the concern with COVID and mental health issues and stuff like that, and why are we not addressing it in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=821)|
| 0:13:53| And so I just figured I would put that out for you since I know we're getting questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| No, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Those are good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| We are planning to address those in the general purpose budget, so it's not that we're parking one particular initiative or initiatives aside in order to do the initiatives with ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=840)|
| 0:14:15| So those things will be covered and brought before the board with a regular budget to where we are bolstering those mental health supports because, you know, one of the things – the advantage, I guess, with regards to placing it in the general purpose budget is once you get it in there, in future years you're not struggling to try to figure out ways to fund extremes in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=855)|
| 0:14:37| So it's more beneficial, actually, for those types of initiatives to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| And one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| I mean, I guess we're all hearing there will be an ESSER 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| So, I mean, have y'all already sort of thought ahead of – not that we're trying to pin you down now because we don't know the money and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| But, I mean, I guess there's probably been thought as to what maybe we could use the next set of money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| I mean, we haven't received any guidance on that yet, and we don't know what that amount is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| We have every reason to believe it would be for the same types of things that ESSER 1.0 and ESSER 2.0 provided for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=905)|
| 0:15:13| ESSER 2.0 was almost identical to 1.0 in the uses, except they added the provision for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=913)|
| 0:15:21| There may have been something in there for addressing learning gaps or something new in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| I can't remember the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Ms. Henderson, is your question for Mr. McPherson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| So, I know last week you explained there's the virtual teacher's pay was $7 million for this past year and $8 million for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| Can you explain to me again why there's an increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| I'll do my best, and Dr. Roswick maybe can provide some more detail to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| I can tell you generally what's happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| So, for this year, when we're trying to get the virtual learning off the ground, everything's moving at an extremely accelerated pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=952)|
| 0:16:01| We have quite a number of teachers now that are teaching on their planning time, and a lot of those are through asynchronous learning, asynchronous courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=961)|
| 0:16:14| And so, what we're trying to do is address those types of issues so we can have a dedicated staff strictly for virtual learning and to do it justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=974)|
| 0:16:25| So, for those times, if we can make this more synchronous along the way rather than having to roll out some of these one-offs, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| So, this would provide a dedicated staff for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Mr. – well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Mr. McMillan, is your question for Mr. McPherson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| Well, I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Something he said, Dr. Roswick might know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| How many do we have approximately teaching on their planning period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| Don't hold me to this, but I can get the correct answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| I'm wanting to say it's maybe as many as 100, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| John, does that sound about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| 100 to 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| That's just a general idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Quite a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| I wanted to make sure it wasn't a thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Ms. Henderson, do you have a follow-up question on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Do we anticipate the same number of kids in virtual for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Like, where did that number come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| I was assuming that virtual would decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| John, do you want to tackle that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| I knew I could only go so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| Nice job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Part of that is we continue to look at our crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| Our anticipation is that it probably will be reduced for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| The magic number, when you look at that, as far as moving toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| We say next year is kind of a transition year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| This was one of those years where we didn't know what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| We kind of had virtual schools, kind of virtual programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| and then a virtual base in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| We think next year, based on what we've learned from this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| from talking to our schools and our principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| that we can start firming that up a little bit more for what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| So prior to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| we were probably the largest district in the state that didn't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| So it wasn't a new thing for Hamilton County, for Metro Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| for some of those schools to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| We think that there will be some families who this has been a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| We know, matter of fact, that it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Some students have really excelled in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| As we've talked to principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| we think the extra stress in the schools has kind of been running those dual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| platforms within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| Some of your teachers are virtual, some are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| The extra burden, the course load that's different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| the people teaching on plans that Ron's talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| that's kind of the quarantine, which hopefully goes away soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Those kinds of things are all the things that have really put the extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| stress on the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Where we see next year is that it potentially becomes a little more firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| that we could have some virtual school kinds of programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| and that may be where it lives long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| We were at almost 19,000 in the fall, about 13,000 this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| I think we're seeing every day this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| In our minds, we were projecting maybe 6,500 for fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| but we think it potentially could be less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| Where we're prepared with the ESSER funds that Ron was just talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| we think we can hold kind of a capacity, about 1,000 elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| about 600 middle, and about 800 high, if that number of kids chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| So about 2,500 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Our thought was, not knowing, again, what the fall looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| and if it continues to improve, that if it's over that 2,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| we may have to ask schools to carry a little bit of that load,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| but it will be a lesser load than they did this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| If we get it down to that 2,500, we would like to apply for those three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| school numbers and move into, again, some of this is stuff I think you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| information on today, but to move to kind of firming up that virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| experience for people to choose, much like they would an L&N STEM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| or a Beaumont or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| So that's kind of, without knowing exactly where that number may fall out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| kind of thinking where we could be for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| Can I ask you one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| So I have heard several downsides from teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| and kids are falling behind in virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Are there going to be, I guess, stricter parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| on who can attend virtual moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| There will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| And, again, I think there's some information I think that you have gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| today that will give some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| So kind of the process of this, we started back in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| having conversations with schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| We spent a lot of time with our Quest program administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| had other principals to weigh into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| as well as teachers that we've kind of seen have been building out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| what that could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| And one of the messages loud and clear were stricter parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| now that we know a little better who can be successful and who cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| So what we'll communicate out, again, for the kind of selection window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| if we do that for the spring, will be these are the prerequisites for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| And off the top of my head, some of those were prior performance academically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| teacher recommendation, some of those things that are into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| We don't think that's the greatest of options for kindergarten students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| and next year we'll kind of put that out there as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Things like attendance are all factors that play into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| kind of where kids performed and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Then we always know, you know, in the middle of this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| whenever it's quote-unquote over, that we leave that appeal process there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| So we're kind of laying it out to say if these are the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| one thing we're going to ask for next year too in elementary grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| is a learning coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Districts have done that, and we like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| So it's somebody who doesn't become the educational rights person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| but it's the adult who's in charge of the kid during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| and we can't, it could be a grandparent, it could be a nonprofit person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| somebody like that who's working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| But we heard that from our schools as well, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| someone who if they're not on, not connecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| they're having a behavior problem, they can contact and have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| You know, they wouldn't have IP rights and all those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| but they would have that point of contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| So some of those things, I'm sure I'm leaving one or two out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| but would be prerequisites on that selection window that parents would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| a training, district-wide training for the orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| expectations, that's one of them too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| And then if, you know, someone had those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| that maybe had a health impairment of a parent or guardian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| obviously we would listen to that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| But there will be thresholds to reach to be able to qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Let's go to Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Dr. Roswick, so is it fair to say that we're basically trying to prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| to scale up in terms of quality and fidelity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| and all that in terms of our virtual learning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| We've learned a lot this last year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| And also I know there's some funding in this proposal for virtual classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| Can you say a word about that and what the hope is with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| and how that helps us even get further down the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| So, you know, we're trying to look at this too to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| what does this look like beyond just this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| And so currently the two programs are housed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| one at Holston and one at Carnes Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| The secondary one is at Carnes Middle and the elementary one is at Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| Both principals are doing great for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| They have the room based on some rezoning that was done a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| And so Holston is probably the place you could see this the best if you wanted to see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| but Russ's team has gone in and put in some dividers in rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| so that we can do multiple teachers in a traditional classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| so that they can teach there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| I think there's about 300,000 put aside in this ESSER to kind of build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| what we're calling studios within there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| And what that would be is just the equipment so that you can virtually teach effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| Some things like dual screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| There's some things like noise canceling headphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| There's some different kind of acoustic sets with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| and some things that digital document cams, all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| So we're going to equip those studios out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| The idea is, again, by day Quest teachers would teach in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| so they're equipped to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| But we think there's potential in after school hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| or maybe even summer hours to use those studios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| for some additional support for students for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| So, again, small amount of money in for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| but the staff you spoke to with Ron about the additional positions for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| So as we begin to build out what our virtual school could look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| we think where that could give relief at the school level is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| the frustrations have been that dual platform to be teachers teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| You know, I've got a hybrid class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| I've got some kids virtual, some are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| I'm teaching second period virtual but first period live, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| We're hoping to release that burden off of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| and move that into more for families who really like virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| will have a choice to go virtual to return schools back to kind of traditional schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| I think it's also important to note that even though we may approve the receipt of this funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| this funding is not getting spent by year end, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| This is June 2023, is that right, Mr. McPherson, that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| September of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| So, you know, I just want the public to know that the proposed plan here is not something to fix today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| It's how do we help get us to tomorrow, which I think is an important distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Okay, and then we're going to go to Ms. Owen and then Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Looking at the number who are teaching during their planned time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| do we also have an idea of the number who are not using their planned time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| but are teaching both virtually and in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1518)|
| 0:25:30| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| So, I'll just make sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| I probably don't have the answer for it, but if we're going to look for it, I'll make sure I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| So, you're saying a teacher who may be teaching both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| So, I'm going to go to like a high school schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| It's easier to break out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| So, I may have a first period of in-person students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| I may have a second period where I'm teaching a virtual section with no in-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| We could probably find that and probably get ready to help us pull that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| I'm not sure if you're talking about that or like a hybrid classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| because some schools went to hybrid classrooms and they actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| this is the first three weeks were hard, but they liked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I know I spent time with a teacher at West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| and she was doing that where she had seven virtual kids and then kind of 13 in-person kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| and they had it worked out and it was working really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| So, again, we've kind of said we've allowed principals to play in those sandbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| with support of their teachers to see what works out best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| So, we have some of those too that have worked well, especially in quarantine situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| but we can try to find that number for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Thank you. Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| I don't mean to belabor the point, but I really wasn't going to get involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| I didn't anticipate it, but you're probably the person to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| I was talking to a teacher last week, and we were talking about a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1602)|
| 0:26:51| but virtual and talking about his classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| and he said he was teaching two classes of the same thing back-to-back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1616)|
| 0:27:05| which he didn't have a problem with, and he said he had about 20 in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1625)|
| 0:27:16| and in one class maybe two or three more or less in the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| and then somewhere from seven to ten that were virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| Now, here's where it gets interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| To me, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| He said that they had been going a long time, and he was in the store one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| and this little girl came up to him and called his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| He didn't know she was, and she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| I'm in your second period virtual class, and I just wonder, is that your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1672)|
| 0:28:01| Have you heard of any other situations like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| Is that unusual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| You know, I think what's been interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| and I think Mr. Watson kind of alluded to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| to see how we've grown this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| and how our teachers have grown and figured out a lot of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| So I think when you talk to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I spent a day with a teacher at Halls Middle who had an in-person class that I was with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| and then we did a virtual class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| When I say we did it, I didn't interfere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| I just watched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| It was interesting to watch her ability to connect to kids and know those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| but she said, I asked her that very question, what was that like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| She said starting the school year out was very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| because you don't see them in the hallways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| and you don't know all that person's with that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| and kind of those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| They play on that sports team, or they do this club, or that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| She said it took a little while longer to get to know students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| but again, what I viewed in there watching that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| a very good relationship with their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| If it's a matter of a student not connecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| or a student not logging on or consistently missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| then it's much like what we do in regular traditional schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| We still use the same social workers and counselors and calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| and even a lot of our administrators have done things like home visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| So to say that it's been 100% foolproof, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| but I think our staffs have, by and large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| found innovative ways to kind of reach out and connect with family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Well, I'm sure we're improving or attempting to as we go along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| but I guess my question for the future would be with these anticipated 2,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1776)|
| 0:29:45| and let's just look at maybe at the high school level for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| Like you say, it's easier to break out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| but it's not more important or less important than the other grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| but why do you anticipate that we'll have 2,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| because the parents are fearful for them to go back to school because of the COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1808)|
| 0:30:19| What's the main driving force, I guess, is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| I think next year, being a transition year, we could have a mixed bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| I think there could still be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| We know from early surveys at the beginning of this year that some people marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| If I remember, I don't remember the percents, but the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| the questions were kind of what kind of things would need to be in place for you to feel comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| and I think it went all the way down to like vaccinations for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| And so some people mark that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| So I don't know how many, again, without having to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| So I'm sure there are still some people and understand that this has been a scary thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| and different people have had different personal experiences with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| So I think there will be some people who will want that kind of level, so some will be from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| But then what's interesting is our REA team continues to kind of pull data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| and look at these things as they've looked at some of the first semester data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| They're starting to find some things where there were some kids who weren't excelling in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| who actually are excelling in virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| And again, why, we'll do follow-up interviews and try to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| So I'd say by and large, again, we've been doing in person a whole lot longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| so we're kind of good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| I think we have some pockets of really good virtual, and we're trying to scale those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| And I think it's the same for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I think there are some kids who that's a good thing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| It works for them, and we have seen some students excel in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| We've seen some not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| As we, to Ms. Henderson's point, kind of put down some prerequisites for what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| that if you've shown a track record of having success within that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| we think about a student who maybe was a freshman this year and did great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| and made A's and everything and things were really good and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I want to do it again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| It's hard to say you shouldn't if you've had success with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| So the number 2,500 where we came up with that is roughly right now in Queston Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| we have 930-ish kids, so we think that capacity could probably be around 1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| and not have to add a lot of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| And then we're really kind of just estimating where we think the middle and high could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| That may be a little less than that, maybe a little more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Again, we'll find out as people kind of apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Just one other comment, and you don't need to comment on this necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| but I have heard from some kids and parents whose kids say that they think they do better virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1954)|
| 0:32:46| because they think that the grading is somewhat easier than having to sit there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1966)|
| 0:32:59| Now, it might have been five, but I did hear that comment, which struck me as kind of unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1979)|
| 0:33:09| That's a good question, and I promise I won't hand the mic over to Ms. Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| because she could talk for two hours on grading practice, and it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| I think that does speak more to grading practice probably than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| So when you look at things like a lot of things can boil into a grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| Sometimes it can be students' behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| Sometimes it can be they show up every day, and they've done a bunch of extra credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| and sometimes it can be based on mastery and what they've really done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| So sometimes I think in virtual you don't do as many assignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| but what you do has to be to show your mastery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| So some people might respond better to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Well, this is just me, and other board members might feel totally different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| but I would hope that we never got into a situation where we were, because of the grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2034)|
| 0:34:02| we were enticing or encouraging them to go virtual as opposed to go in person, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| No, thank you. I would totally agree with that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2050)|

| 0:37:01| And we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Yes, we do. Angela Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2223)|
| 0:37:12| I think you'll just state your name and county of residence and you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| My name is Angela Lawson and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| I wanted to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak. I'm a little bit nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| On behalf of the TAs in my building and I feel like across the board, the TAs, in regard to the possible bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2246)|
| 0:37:35| I've been teaching a TA at Gibbs Elementary for almost 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| I love my job and could not wait to be back in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| I knew this year would look different and that my job would too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| My year started out with me teaching in a classroom, fifth graders who were coming back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| I didn't care because we were back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Two weeks into every term, I was exhausted from working two jobs for Knox County and from feeling as if I had been taken advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2276)|
| 0:38:05| The two jobs I speak of are teaching assistant and substitute teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| The reason I felt I was being taken advantage of was I was only being paid for a teaching assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| Then I learned that if I was a sub, I would have qualified for a $300 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| When talking with my husband, I tried convincing him, and to be honest with myself, that this was the season and I am truly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| So I continued to work, coming in early to do TA stuff, 6.30 in the morning, and then going into the classroom as needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| and then staying late, 4.35 o'clock, to finish my TA job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| All of this time saving Knox County schools $80 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| I have, so far this year, cleaned messes, put hot food on the line, taking it out of the warmer for the kids to have breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| I've made trillions of copies. I've laminated. I've cleaned vomit. I've helped kids who were sick and scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| I've sat on the playground for three hours at 32 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| I've taped temperatures. I've taught science, math, ELA, social studies, intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| and I've had two classes in the cafeteria teaching them right before we went red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| I was doing whatever it took for the kids to stay in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| My school appreciates me beyond belief, but I do not get that feeling from the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| You see, according to the district, my value is half of what a certified person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| I get it, but when a degree is not necessary for a sub to get a $300 to $500 bonus every single month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| then it should not be held against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I appreciate the fact that Mr. Thomas is trying to include classified when the state did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| I'm grateful for what he's trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| If funding is tight, how about pull from the sub budget, since every time I'm asked to sub, it saves Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| There are four TAs being pulled all the time in my building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| and at least one of us is in a classroom two to three days a week with a savings of about $4,000 for my building alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| not including sub bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Maybe we could pull from these funds to compensate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| No one cares if I'm classified or certified when a classroom doesn't have a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| At that time, my status doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| Again, I'm asking you to please consider increasing the TA's possible bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| And I pray you're hearing this from my heart and not out of anger or anything like that, because that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Thank you, Ms. Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| We appreciate you coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2444)|
| 0:40:54| So your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Tanya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| So you can hear the plea right before me as in regards to all the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| I know that you've heard from the superintendent last month or just last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Last week we talked about all the services that we do as educators in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| and not just distinguishing between teachers and educational support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| but all the things that we've had to do in regards to this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| One thing I want to be clear is that we are really beyond grateful of anything that you're giving us at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| because we know that it's the governor's responsibility to actually make this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| We have to be diligent together in making sure that BEP is funded correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| because we are, as I know that you've heard, if you've not and you're new to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| and know that we have over 500 positions that we have to pull out of our own budget just to compensate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| to have what kids need here in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| The monies that was sent, that $2.5 million, was only sent for classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| If you were to divide that, and I'm going to take the low number, which really could be close to the high number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| of 4,700 certified teachers in Knox County schools, it's only $500 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| That's nothing compared to all the money that they have at the state, on the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| They could do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| The taxes came back higher than which they thought they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| They had money in their reserves higher than what they have, what they sent to local districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| and it's a disgrace to know that we have to struggle in Knox County just to do what's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| by the people that kept this district running since August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| So I'm not busting at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| I'm just letting you know that we need to join together to know that our state could do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| If our governor won't do better, we might need to get somebody else to do better by our students in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| But we want to tell you thank you, and we can't ask for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| You are a donor county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| I have a BEP formula page that I will send to all of you and all the comparable districts that are just like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| We only get close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| We get less than 45 percent of the money from the state, and we should get well more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| We shouldn't send more money out to other districts when we take it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| We send about $30 million out to other districts, and I understand when rural districts don't have the money to help run their districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2599)|
| 0:43:28| but it actually hurts us in Knox County where we could be funding our educational support staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| and helping them get to a cost of living, or we can help our educators and not be at 37 in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| That's a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| And the only way that they're going to be able to do that is if we ask, we join together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| and make sure they give us the money that we're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| Because public education has been in a deficit well before this pandemic, and you should not take this burden alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| And again, I want to say thank you on behalf of the educators, because any cent that you give us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| we're going to be thankful and thankful that we got it, and we're not giving it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| That concludes speakers on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Superintendent Thomas, would you like to review kind of where we started with this conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| And it's been mentioned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I'll talk about it again in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Of course, the state sent a little over $2.5 million, which, as Ms. Coates pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| would provide roughly a $500 increase for some certified personnel, not all certified personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| And that $2.5 million was specified, again, was not to go to classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| But as we had our conversation among ourselves before we brought it to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| we thought all certified employees and classified, too, everyone has worked really hard to make this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| knock on wood, the success that it's been so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| And looking forward to coming back from spring break and finishing out the school year in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| the graduations and the whole work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| So I'll deviate for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| So I get excited every time I talk about what we've been able to accomplish, our folks have been able to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| And as mentioned, our classified folks have worked tremendously hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| and appreciate the conversation about, hey, we've covered classrooms, we've playground and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| So in looking at it, we thought, okay, we need to make sure we provide a bonus for classified as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| So since the state was looking at roughly $500 for some certified, we said, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| what does it cost locally for us to provide a $500 increase to make sure that our classified folks got some money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2738)|
| 0:45:49| So that's where we kind of came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| The rationale, I guess, was to take local money and make sure that our classified folks participated in the incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2751)|
| 0:46:00| And by the way, we're calling it incentive rather than bonus, so it's not taxed at that higher bonus rate of 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2760)|
| 0:46:08| So that was kind of the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| And let me say this, and I agree with what's been said tonight in terms of, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| if we spend more money and we can give an increase, $1,000 to everybody, I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| And I think we can talk to Ron about this, long-time conversations about, hey, can we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| And I think with surplus revenues, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| It's about $4.8 million that we're putting in locally to do the $1,000 and the $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| It would be an additional, I think, $1.4 million, close to $1.4 million to do $1,000 for classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| But that would treat everyone the same, and everyone I know has worked really hard to make this year the year that it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2806)|
| 0:46:54| So I would certainly, if the board wishes to alter that recommendation and say, hey, $1,000 for all of our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2814)|
| 0:47:03| we would certainly support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| So the additional cost would be about $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| And if there are other questions, I'll try to field those, or Ron can help me if I get stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| And thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| And I'll just make a note that we do not currently have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| So if anyone wishes to make a motion, they can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| I would like to make a motion to accept the recommendation from Superintendent Thomas to make $1,000 for all of our staff within KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2850)|
| 0:47:39| Is that right, Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| We have a second by Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| So, Mr. Dupler, was that a proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| I don't think he likes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| I don't know if Mr. Thomas might want to supply some language from his material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| And then, Ms. Satterfield, you can kind of take it from there so that we've got a solid motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Mr. Thomas, do you have that, or do you want to call on Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Yeah, I don't know in terms of the language other than to approve a midyear salary incentive in the amount of $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2891)|
| 0:48:20| for all certified and classified employees of Knox County Schools, if that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| And let me just say before you vote on that, if you approve that, I'll be one of the happiest people sitting around the table for our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2907)|
| 0:48:37| because they have worked extremely hard and are very deserving of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Ms. Satterfield, are you agreeable to that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| And Mr. McMillan, were you second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| I do, but I just want a clarifying thing for the audience or anybody that does not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| This is a one-time bonus, correct, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Yes, sir, one-time salary incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| We could do it again later down the road if we have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| But it is just one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Okay, so we have a first and a second on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| I'm like a broken record on trying to increase teacher pay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| I have a question for you, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| If we embedded it in the salaries, how much more over that would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| That way you're increasing their salary versus a one-time pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| Well, thank you, Madam Chair and Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| So what would be the best approach would be typically what we do if we increase salary, we increase it by a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2975)|
| 0:49:46| This, however, is not a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| I mean, we do some percentage equivalents, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| But this would be just $1,000 for every employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2991)|
| 0:49:59| We would need to revisit the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| If we were going to stick with just a standard amount, we would need to revise the salary structure if we were to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3001)|
| 0:50:10| Also, we would be committing dollars into the following year budget to continue that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| But I can tell you, though, that the superintendent has made it very clear to the finance department that salary increases are going to be a priority in this budget, just like they normally are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3017)|
| 0:50:31| So I just want to put that out there that by doing this as a one-time incentive does not imperil their motivation for increasing salaries in the upcoming year, if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3031)|
| 0:50:46| And we will be discussing, I mean, board members will be talking about that later on this month, actually, into the budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| So, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| First thing of note, Superintendent, I really appreciate your adjusted recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| I actually had several teachers reach out to me and actually advocate for their classified staff, which I thought was beautiful, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| I also want to acknowledge that in potentially voting for this proposal, I have a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| My wife is a teacher at Beaumont at fifth grade, and she is teaching three-quarter time right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| I understand from Mr. McPherson that anybody who is not working full-time, that amount would be adjusted, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| So we would have to go through and look at employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| So we do have some that are part-time, so we would need to adjust that accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| So I just want to acknowledge the conflict and also say I think I can vote on this on behalf of all 8,000 of our employees and vote on the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3099)|
| 0:51:47| But I do want to see if there are any objections from the board if I vote on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| Any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Anything else, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Yeah, I just have a question because I know, assuming this passes, a lot of us will probably have this question tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| When can employees expect to see this if it does pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| Of course, we were waiting for the approval tonight to see what the board was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| And I don't know, Ron, if we have a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| We're going to do ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| I don't know if you've had an opportunity to talk to payroll yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| I don't have a definite time because there are some anomalies, so to speak, that we have to look at for some employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3151)|
| 0:52:41| So this was kind of up in the air what eventually we would land on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| I can tell you, though, we would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| We would do everything we could to get this out in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| I know we're working right now on the March payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| We're getting fairly close to the timeline for March payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| So I would think soon after March payroll, I guess it's the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| I've not looked at the calendar, but the 25th of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| So sometime after that, but before hopefully early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Yes, it would definitely not extend beyond April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| And one thing came up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| I don't know, Mr. Dupre, on this, too, because we were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| I don't know if we need to add full-time employees into that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| If we're going to make adjustments for part-time, it might need to read $1,000 for full-time certified and classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3204)|
| 0:53:34| And then that way we can adjust it based on half-time or three-quarter time, what other folks work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| Mr. Dupre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Yes, Mr. Thomas, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Just to make sure that the motion is very clear, I would like to make that amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3224)|
| 0:53:52| And if Ms. Satterfield would be agreeable to that, then it could just be a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| I agree to the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| So basically, do we need to be specific in the motion that part-time will be a prorated incentive, or does that need to be included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3245)|
| 0:54:19| I think we can certainly restate the motion if you want to have maybe Ms. Coatney restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| Let's work on the language a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| I hate to belabor it, but then have Ms. Satterfield and Mr. McMillan acknowledge it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| So I believe the motion on the floor is approve mid-year salary increase of $1,000 for all employees of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3277)|
| 0:54:45| So the first amendment would be all full-time employees for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| So then my question was, do we need to add language with the intent that part-time employees would have a prorated incentive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3291)|
| 0:55:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| I think that, again, it's helpful to be as clear as possible, and I'm sure Mr. Thomas and everybody else would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| Madam Chair, I believe Ms. Coatney read salary increase, which is not the correct language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| It should be incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| Would you read what you currently have, Ms. Coatney, with the words full-time in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3320)|
| 0:55:29| Approve mid-year salary incentive of $1,000 for all full-time employees of Knox County Schools and necessary adjustment for part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3329)|
| 0:55:41| What would be the correct verbiage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| Prorated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Prorated is what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Prorated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Yeah, with a prorated incentive for part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3347)|
| 0:55:56| And if you'll read that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| Approve mid-year salary incentive of $1,000 for all full-time employees of Knox County Schools with prorated incentives for part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| And Mr. McMillan, you're fine with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Thank you very much, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Do we need the word one-time in there, or is incentive good enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| I think – sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| Ms. Owen, I think – I mean, it's certainly been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| It's been made very clear that it's one-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| I mean, that's one – we could go either way, but I think at this point we can just go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| If it's clear, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| I think the word incentive implies that it's one-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| And I'll just say on behalf of the board, because I know from the board that we truly appreciate Mr. Thomas and McPherson –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3411)|
| 0:56:59| Mr. McPherson and the finance team working on this and appreciate all the hard work of every single Knox County employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3419)|
| 0:57:07| because, you know, when you read different stories from around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| I continue to be amazed at how far ahead Knox County is than so many other parts of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| So that is a testament to every single employee at every single building, every single position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| So we couldn't do it without every single person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| So I know that this board is thrilled and the superintendent is thrilled to be able to give this very small token.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3448)|
| 0:57:36| And we recognize it's a small token for all the efforts that you've all put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| But we truly do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| So I don't think anybody would disagree with how happy we are that we can at least do a small token of our appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| And we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| Do we have about nine or ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| We've got –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| We have roughly nine, ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| So we have 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Would the board like to take a break for a few minutes before we move into public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| We have about 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Let's take a ten-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Let's start back at, I think, 6-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3498)|
| 0:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| We're going to call the first speaker, Loren Seagrave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3512)|
| 0:58:43| If you'd come to the podium, say your name, county of residence, and then you get five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| My name is Loren Seagrave, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| And I'm a senior at Osanese Magnet High School, and I have a speech that I prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| On March 3rd, at 4.56 before I went into work, my body tried to forget how to breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| I was being constricted by the pipeline that my fellow classmates were being pumped into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| the metal conforming around my lungs, quickening my breath, and forcing all the bile in my stomach to come retching up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3552)|
| 0:59:20| I could feel the future generations of black students' skin being turned to oil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| traveling thousands of meters to its eventual end, being used to fuel a system that scorned them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| And in a way, the Knox County School Board is furthering this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| Justin Taylor, Stanley Freeman Jr., and Janaria Muhammad were all shot and killed within a month of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| Each of these kids were under the age of 16 and were killed outside of Osanese Magnet High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3585)|
| 0:59:53| And instead of directly fighting the root of the problem, things were changed at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| Increased police activity in the area, with more new SROs being hired to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| and on March 8th, every Osanese student was required to wear a clear or mesh backpack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| My name is Loren Seagrave, and I'm a senior at Osanese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| Thank you for allowing me to speak here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| But before I officially start talking about the details, I hope that I'm about to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| what I'm about to say helps you to be able to identify the problem that our community is facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| and for me to try to provide the solutions that you could use to better our school and our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| The root of the problem is the social and economic problems that these kids are forced to endure because of where they grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3638)|
| 1:00:46| This community has been in a cycle of poverty since 1863, and these kids don't know how to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3646)|
| 1:00:54| They turn to gangs, drugs, and sex after school to deal with their problems that begin to get bigger and bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3654)|
| 1:01:05| You try to take away funding from programs who introduce them to ways to traverse this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3665)|
| 1:01:13| And, unfortunately, try to defund Project Grad and the departments inside the school that give these students homes, families, and places to turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3673)|
| 1:01:24| And instead, they try to find homes, families, and places to turn in people who want to beat them to a pulp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3684)|
| 1:01:36| Black lower-income neighborhoods are more policed than any other place in America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| and schools in these areas are implementing zero-tolerance policies that outsource punishment to the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3701)|
| 1:01:49| According to a study done by ACLU that tried to challenge the school-to-prison pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| black students get disproportionately harsher punishments than white students in public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| and black students make up 31% of school-related arrests, three times more than white students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3721)|
| 1:02:08| And these students that are suspended for violations are nearly three times more likely to be in contact with the juvenile justice system the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3728)|
| 1:02:20| Gangs and Stanley's murderers prey on the young, weak, and abandoned that are somewhat caused by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3740)|
| 1:02:31| Instead of providing punishment for these students, sit them down with a counselor or therapist from the funding you give these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3751)|
| 1:02:39| and have them try to understand why these students are doing what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| Eliminate the behavior, and then tell them their options after high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| They don't have to turn to these negative outlets that ruin their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| and their lives aren't ruined by the harsh punishments given to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| Give them positive outlets that they can turn to, and they can turn into passions that they can use to help their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3780)|
| 1:03:09| You have the choice to change this problem as the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| Project RAD helps students realize their full potential and help them into colleges and seize opportunities after high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3794)|
| 1:03:23| They give on-campus experience to make sure these students want to go to college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| and push them to summer institutes, college and career fairs, and tours of college campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| They get students ready with ACT registration and test prep so they can get into colleges without being in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| They fill out FAFSAs, help with scholarships, intervene when students' grades are dropping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3822)|
| 1:03:49| and help provide the basic needs, emotional, personal, social support for these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3829)|
| 1:04:00| Okay, I'm going to have to stop you at five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| If you have more that you'd like to send, it sounds like you've got something prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| If you want to send it to Ms. Coatney, she can send it to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| We appreciate you coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| Thank you for hearing me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| No, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| Jennifer Sauer, and then Led Hinton will be after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3861)|
| 1:04:33| And if you will state your name and county of residence, and then you get five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| All right, Jennifer Sauer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Good evening, my name is Jennifer Sauer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| I've been a middle school teacher here in Knox County for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| and a parent of two children who attend Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| I'm also a member of KCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| We are reaching the end of the school year, but I felt compelled to speak tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| as teachers' voices are critical in moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| When I hear from teachers across the county, three common themes arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| Physical safety, mental health, and funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| We are not out of this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Safety must be upheld fairly and equitably in all schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| The same standards should apply when it comes to wearing masks safely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| physically distancing at least six feet, and access to effective PPE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| We are seeing mask fatigue with students, but this is not the time to give in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| On a side note, to briefly respond to those that spoke in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| masks do save lives, and without them in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| I would be reading to you the names of KCS staff who lost their lives for the next five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| I'm so happy that I don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| We always accommodate students who cannot wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| This is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Second, and I really appreciate what the young student said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| we are in a critical need for mental health and social-emotional support for our students and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| From the loss of loved ones due to COVID, to racial inequities brought up over the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| to economical hardships, we are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| We have communities facing gun violence and the loss of students here in KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| As teachers, we have seen students in crisis before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| but this year and the years to follow will be paramount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| When I speak to my students both virtually and in person, this is what I usually hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| We're sad, Ms. Sauer. We're depressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Another young lady said to me, I feel overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| This is too much work. I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| And she just wants us to ask her how we're doing once in a while, not academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| The reality is that we cannot do it alone, and believe me, as a teacher, I wish I could fix it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| Teachers daily have the weight of this pandemic on their shoulders and their students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| and no teacher wants to walk away from their pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Truly meeting the needs of our kids will require KCS to have a trauma-informed system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| We ask the Board and KCS to take the steps necessary to be trauma-informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| with smaller class sizes, paid training for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| and the time to truly support students during the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| It's ludicrous to me that the state is spending money and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| on standardized tests and teacher evaluations during this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| but I totally realize this is out of your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| These issues facing our schools are not small, but we do have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| KCS will have $50.8 million for COVID-related expenses and a rainy day fund that we could use now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| We're even projected to have $22 million more from sales tax than was expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| We can use the ESSER funds to help pay for counselors in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| We can pay for COVID days, PPE, keeping our schools clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| and a living wage for our amazing custodians who've gone above and beyond long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| We have the money if we prioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| We can use one-time pay to get us out of this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| We can help pay for the absurd amount of overtime teachers have had to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| to convert everything to online learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| calling and emailing students who are absent from virtual classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| and going above and beyond to make learning engaging but still safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| Given that we rank 46th in the nation in pupil spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| no one should expect teachers to continue spending nights and weekends away from family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| to do the needed work to make schools equitable, safe, and a joyful learning space for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| We can't do it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| The reality is we will lose good teachers, committed teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| as one in three teachers quit after five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| We need support and relief now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| We need to come together with parents and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| We need a seat at the table to make KCS the best it can be for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| Thank you so much for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Led Hinton is next, and after that is Betsy Hobkirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| Led Hinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4156)|
| 1:09:26| If you will state your name and county of residence, and then you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| Hi, my name is Led Hinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| So this year with COVID and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| prom has been something that students have been wondering about all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| Is it going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| And so in the past month to hear that dates from private schools or non-KCS schools would not be allowed to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4183)|
| 1:09:51| has been very heartbreaking for many students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| With pretty much all schools being shut down since last March for the whole summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| students socialized with many people that they normally wouldn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| and now in my grade in school alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| there's about 12 to 20 people who have committed relationships with people that they cannot take to prom, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4206)|
| 1:10:15| And I would like to get this rule changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| I took a survey of students from outside schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4219)|
| 1:10:32| 100% said that they would be willing that they and their parents would be willing to sign a liability waiver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| waiving the Knox County of all liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| Also, very interesting statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| 30% of these students that are looking at coming to our prom have already had COVID in the last three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| So the antibodies are still in their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| Finally, 86.8% of students said that they would be willing to get a COVID test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4257)|
| 1:11:04| and quarantine from the time of the test to the time of the prom if that would be so allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| This year has already been extremely hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| This isn't asking to raise the amount of students that are prom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| This is simply asking for the students to be allowed to bring who they would like to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| I don't know if I need to motion or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| No, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Thank you very much for coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Betsy Hobkirk, and after that will be Hillary Godsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4293)|
| 1:11:42| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| I'm Betsy Hobkirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Thanks for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| I'm an elementary school art teacher in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| Before I taught art, I worked in community public health for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| I look at the COVID pandemic through the lens of public health as well as a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| As we move into spring and beyond, I encourage the Board of Education to consider the following issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| Number one, really understanding the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| When I reached out to several of you about my concerns, you referenced the American Academy of Pediatrics as a source of your decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4331)|
| 1:12:19| This prompted me to look closer at the AAP and the research they were citing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| If research is being used to guide policies, which is a great idea, then the limitations need to be fully understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| All research studies acknowledge their limitations and include a section in the end which outlines them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| For example, a study by Duke and University of North Carolina was promoted by American Academy of Pediatrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4357)|
| 1:12:46| The study states that in-school transmission of COVID is rare in schools that implement safety measures and that schools do not cause larger community infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4366)|
| 1:12:54| While the headline sounds good, this study clearly states that one of its major limitations is the school districts participating in the study significantly reduced their student population at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4374)|
| 1:13:06| When I put the Duke study side by side with Knox County's COVID plan, it was clear that Knox County fell short of what they were doing in the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| For example, during the study in North Carolina, schools were either 100% remote or using a hybrid in-person model where students attended school twice a week with only 50% of students in the school building on any given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4394)|
| 1:13:29| No students were in the buildings on Wednesdays for cleaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| Schools were able to maintain small cohorts of students that did not intermingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| So physical distancing was more possible and masks were required and if someone could not use one, they were given a face shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| So of course transmission rates were low in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| Number two, moving along to funding priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| We've already heard of the funding opportunities that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| My wish list, pay teachers for overtime and the time required to rework our curriculums for the last past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4436)|
| 1:14:04| Pays custodians a decent wage to keep our schools clean and sanitized properly and to eliminate once and for all the chronic custodial shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4444)|
| 1:14:14| Reimburse teachers for COVID-related sick days used for taking days off to get COVID tests, quarantine, or drive to another county to get the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4454)|
| 1:14:23| Upgrade HVAC systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics both recommend improving ventilation as a mitigation strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| They recommend opening doors and windows as one strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| I have kept my classroom door open at times, but it makes me very uneasy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| It puts schools at risk for active shooters and other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Number three, moving on to mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| Let's truly create a trauma-informed school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| And I say system because addressing the social and emotional needs of students cannot fall just on the shoulders of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| We are part of the system, but not all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| We need more trained mental health counselors and social workers in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| What are the best practices for creating a trauma-informed school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| How are cultural competency and racial equity part of a trauma-informed school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| What are the implications for class size and teacher-student ratios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| What kind of in-depth training do teachers need to really be effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| Finally, let's truly give teachers a seat at the table where we can work together with parents, communities, and school policymakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| This year has amplified the disconnect between the day-to-day realities of teachers and the decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4533)|
| 1:15:41| It's time to close the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| There are anecdotal accounts of central office staff pushing back and resisting principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| when principals expressed their concerns about cases and quarantines in their schools and felt going red was the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4549)|
| 1:15:57| Why was this even an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| We have been given gallons of hand sanitizer but no COVID protective screens for our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| When you go to a gas station, grocery store, any public establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| they almost all have some kind of protective barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| I'm just wondering, have you ever looked at those barriers and thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| we need to make sure we make something similar available to teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| And if you did think it, why didn't you do anything about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| And if not, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| I ended up creating my own and paying for my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| The main question I have on my mind at this point in the year is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| I think you have done everything possible to support teachers and students in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| And what are your plans as we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Hilary Godsey next and then Elizabeth Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4608)|
| 1:17:04| If you would say your name and county residence and you get five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| My name is Hilary Godsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| I've been here a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| You might recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| I have nothing prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| I'm going to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| It's been a little emotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| I've talked to a couple of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| I've emailed all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| I've only heard from four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| I'm a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| I have a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| You guys work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| We voted you in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| You might get a paycheck from the school, but we put you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| And we at least deserve to be listened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| I got an email today from the superintendent's office that said that you all follow the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| The CDC came out five days ago and pretty much said masks, they do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| The CDC said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| Off their website, and I can send all of you this link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| It says the daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4689)|
| 1:18:18| There was no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| So why are we forcing our kids to wear masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| I'm not saying that we have to get rid of them completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| If there are parents who feel like their kids need to wear them to be protected, let them wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| It doesn't affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| But why does my child have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| My six-year-old came to me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| I didn't say a word to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| She said, mommy, the sickness is almost over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| I said, honey, how do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| She said, because I'm done with the masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| A six-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| She shouldn't have to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Parents should be allowed in the school to partake in what's going on in our kids' lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| I've never seen my kid's school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| I've never stepped foot in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| I don't know what her classroom looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| I don't know what her school looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| I don't know where she goes when she goes to chorus, when she goes to gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| I've only met her teacher and her principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| Why are we not allowed to have more meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| Why are we not allowed in the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| My neighbor has missed out on every single event of her fifth-grade student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| She never gets that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Because the CDC said masks don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Is that why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| I don't understand why we can't have a common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| If you want to get the vaccine, get the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| But you are also responsible for the people who feel like their children are having mental issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| are having sick issues because of the masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| You have to be on their side, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| You have to at least listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| There has to be more back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| I don't even care if you disagree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| There are people that emailed me that do not see eye-to-eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| At least they're responding to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| At least we're having a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Elizabeth Wagner, and after that, Logan Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4815)|
| 1:20:32| If you would state your name and county of residence, and then you get five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| My name is Elizabeth Wagner, and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| I have four children within the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| I have two in middle school and two in elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| We have been in Knox County school system for the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| And up until 2020, we have absolutely loved our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| We have amazing teachers, coaches, and staff at the schools that they have attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| And there's no doubt in my mind that my children have teachers who are going above and beyond for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| We chose the area of Knoxville that we live in because of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| Since the pandemic began, I've seen the focus slowly shift from education of my children to health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4867)|
| 1:21:15| My seventh grader has been in chorus since the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| They've only been allowed to sing in class around once a week, despite wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| distancing by measuring from nose to nose six feet, and having two air purifiers in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4884)|
| 1:21:33| Instead of singing, they have been studying music history and have watched musicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| While I see the benefit of these things, I would not have enrolled her in chorus had I known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| that she would endure a daily lecture on health and safety in this pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4902)|

| 1:21:51| Contrast that with my son, who is in band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| He is allowed and encouraged to play his instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4914)|

| 1:21:59| The individual rules and guidelines for each class and teacher are concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| I believe when my child signs up for a class, they should be able to participate in that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| My daughter, whose favorite class used to be chorus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| comes home complaining daily about another lecture on why singing is dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| and how to remain safe during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| I believe it is our school's job, our teacher's job, to educate our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| That leads me to speak about risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Risk is something that is part of every single one of our daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| Each one of you got up this morning and drove in a car to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| According to statistics by automobile insurance companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| you will most likely be involved in at least three car accidents over the course of your lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| This is a risk that we are willing to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| We know that there is a chance that getting into a vehicle could end in a fatality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| Yet most of us daily take on that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| In Knox County, there have been zero deaths in the 0 to 17 category due to the coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| The next category, age 18 to 44, only has 11 deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| which accounts for 0.05% of the Knox County death rate of coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4983)|
| 1:23:10| Living life automatically comes with risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| We won't be able to mitigate every risk in life, nor will we in this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| However, I think it is our rights as parents to choose which risks we are willing to take with our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| Most children are unable to wear masks properly in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| Some people, even here tonight, are unable to wear masks properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| The masks are touched often and then become a carrier of germs strapped to their faces for the majority of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| Mental health is also something that I think bears discussing on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Our entire lives, we have been taught to read facial cues to interact with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| The wince of pain or the shy smile when you try to maneuver around somebody who you're approaching on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| These cues not only help us feel out our world, but they also connect with things like trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| We've all heard the saying, smiles are contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| They actually activate molecules in your brain that fend off stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| When you smile, it releases dopamine into your brain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| and the lack of seeing people's expressions curb those mental reactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| I don't even have to dive into the science behind it, which I have, and you're welcome to, to know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| I know this from personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| My second grader reacts much differently to people with a mask on than people without a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| If this is so easy for me to see in the behavior of just one of my children, how common must it be in our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| How much does it take away from their learning experience to not see faces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| How much does it impact our children trusting their teachers or learning from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| By mandating and requiring them to cover their faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| I believe we are stripping them of the ability to connect with their peers and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| in what is already a trying time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| While I believe it is important to watch out for the health of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| I don't think that ignoring the other impacts of this pandemic or the mask rule is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| Seeing as how children are not the main drivers of this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| and they are more likely to wear a mask improperly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| I'm asking the school board to remove the requirement of wearing a face mask for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| I'm not asking you to ban the use of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| I'm simply asking you to give our children and their parents the freedom of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| I'm asking you that you give parents the opportunity to choose which risks they are willing to take with their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| I'm asking you to hand over the responsibility of mitigating the risk to the people who knows what's best for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5122)|
| 1:25:30| I'm asking you to relinquish the requirement and make it a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| Logan Taylor and then Sherry Garrett after Logan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5138)|
| 1:25:53| My name is Logan Taylor and I am a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| Good evening, Superintendent Thomas and board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| My name is Logan Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| I am a sophomore, a Knox County Fine Arts student, and a member of the Halls High School Madrigals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| My sister came before you in November of 2020, asking you to allow our Fine Arts choirs to perform during the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| Thankfully, we were allowed to perform, and on behalf of my fellow Madrigals, I would like to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| This evening, I come to you again on behalf of my fellow Knox County Fine Arts students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| Several of the 15 high schools in our county are planning to hold musical or theater performances before the end of this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5186)|
| 1:26:33| In 16 days, our choral department will begin performing our musical that was canceled in March of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| This will be my sister's last high school performance, and it will be the only one and only time that I will perform with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| To that end, I am asking you to allow our choir and all of Knox County High School musical theater and performing arts students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| the option to be masked or unmasked on stage during these year-end performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| I am asking for choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| That each student and family be given the opportunity to choose what is best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| Parents can sign a form or a waiver to permit or decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| Those that choose to mask on stage may do so, and those that choose to be unmasked on stage may also do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5227)|
| 1:27:14| Musical theater involves acting, singing, and dancing in order to tell a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| Facial expressions play a huge part in the acting component, allowing a character to portray such emotions as joy, anger, fear, surprise, and pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5238)|
| 1:27:27| Actors also respond to facial cues in order to follow through with lines and actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| Masks impede the delivery of these emotions and cues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| The delivery of our lines and the ability to sing while dancing on stage is also affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| Our audiences will also be farther away due to social distancing, making it a challenge for us to be well-herded masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| And you may be thinking, well, you've been practicing for months while masked. This should not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| However, we only rehearse a scene or two and a song or two each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| We take frequent breaks, and we are not in full costume under hot stage lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| Our first complete performance will be opening night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| I will repeat what has been said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Knox County athletes have not been forced to mask while actively playing their sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| Football, basketball, wrestling, and now track students are not masked while actively participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| Why are Knox County fine arts students denied the same opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| At the last meeting, the Colorado aerosol study was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| This study has not been completed, and there is no new information from 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| How is this study even relevant in our community now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| When COVID-related issues have significantly declined and when more people have reportedly taken a vaccine than have tested positive for the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5313)|
| 1:28:41| In recent weeks, there have been public schools in surrounding counties, one for one, where students could choose to be unmasked on stage during theater performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5321)|
| 1:28:51| Also, two local private schools recently performed musicals, and all students chose to be unmasked while on stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| There were reportedly no COVID-related issues following the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| How does the Colorado aerosol study make sense in these cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| Last week, it was said that a Knox County survey was given to K-12 fine arts teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| It was reported that only 12 respondents felt students should not wear a mask while performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| Could it be that these 12 respondents represent the 15 high schools with these programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| If so, that would be very, very important information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| The fact is that large-scale musicals and concerts occur mainly in high school settings, and these teachers have a different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| They understand that many of their students have dreams of pursuing performing arts degrees, that scholarships may even be at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5371)|
| 1:29:39| They also know that many of us are hurting, and they want us to be treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| I heard someone say this, students having to wear masks to act, sing, and dance is like basketball players having to wear mittens with one hand tied behind their backs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5383)|
| 1:29:53| It just doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| By not allowing fine arts students this choice, it continues to show the disparity between sports and the fine arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| As members of the school board, do you all serve the students of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| If so, I pray that you will listen to what we are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5412)|

| 1:30:42| This little piece of cloth that you all are wearing has become the most contentious reminder of our battle with COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| This mask has become so politicized that it prevents rational consideration of the evidence even across political lines and drives levels of acrimony, invidious actions, disdain, and villainy among wearers to each other who feel threatened by the individual who will not or cannot wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5449)|
| 1:31:06| Just how dangerous is this virus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| Based on studies done by Professor John P.A. Ioannidis of Stanford University, we know that we are dealing with a virus that has an infection fatality rate of 0.05 in persons 70 years and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5469)|
| 1:31:23| This compares quite well to the IFR of most influenza viruses and even lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| Yet the draconian and massive reactions to SARS-CoV-2 have never been employed during influenza season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| This public has been lied to and deceived from day one by governments and their medical advisors and the media with this incessant messaging that we are all at equal risk of severe illness or death if we get infected, young and old alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5495)|
| 1:31:48| They have subverted science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| This has caused irrational fear and hysteria and has resulted in an unfounded fear that has driven by the media despite a thousand-fold difference between old and young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5511)|
| 1:32:00| Data has suggested that children not only have extremely low risk of contracting this disease, they also naturally have the capability of evading the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to the lack of ACE2 receptors in their nostrils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5520)|
| 1:32:13| What does the evidence show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| Evidence is accumulating about the potential harms of mask use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| For example, the CDC's own February 2021 double-mask study reported that masking may impede breathing, which can trigger a variety of other problems, including acute anxiety attacks in susceptible individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5540)|
| 1:32:31| These harms are even more likely to occur in children, particularly small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| Hence, the increase in ER visits linked to mental health problems for children ages 5 to 11 by 25 percent and for those ages 12 to 17 by 31 percent between April and October of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5557)|
| 1:32:48| A German blood registry used by 20,353 parents who reported on data on almost 26,000 children found that the average wearing time of the mask was 270 minutes per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5568)|
| 1:33:01| Impairments caused by wearing the mask were reported by 68 percent of the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| These include irritability, 60 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| Headache, 53 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| Difficulty concentrating, 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| Less happiness, 49 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| Reluctance to go to school, 44 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Malaise, 42 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5599)|

| 1:33:23| And drowsiness or fatigue, 37 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| The science is clear, and thus the question becomes, what is the benefit of masks for children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| Is masking your children really more about seeming to do something, even though it is ineffective or possibly harmful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| If the possible harms outweigh the negligible and questionable benefit in such a low-risk group, then why must they wear their masks indoors and outdoors at school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5620)|
| 1:33:48| Masks in children with such near-zero risk of transmission and illness from COVID is not necessary and illogical and irrational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5628)|
| 1:33:57| I've been watching you all wearing your masks tonight, touching them, adjusting them, pulling them down to take a drink and pulling them back up, taking them off to speak and putting them back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5637)|
| 1:34:08| Each time you do that, you've cross-contaminated your masks and each and everything you touch afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| If you can't even wear your masks properly, how do you expect the kids to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| Improper mask wearing has been shown to increase your risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| To close, masking children is as absurd, illogical, nonsensical, potentially dangerous, and in my opinion, abusive, as trying to stop every case of COVID or stopping COVID at all costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5662)|
| 1:34:35| Masks are not needed for children based on near-zero risk in children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| The risk of dying from COVID-19 is almost zero for young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| The issue of masks in children is really a risk management question for parents and any decision-maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| The science is settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| Now, are you going to put the needs of our kids first, as we voted you in to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| Do the job you were voted in to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Resign, or we will primary each and every one of you who does not do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5703)|

| 1:35:26| Yes, Kaitlin Moorhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| My county of residence is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| My name is Kaitlin Southall, and I am a Pellissippi State student, and more importantly, an active and concerned member of the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| I'm here to voice not only my concerns, but those of teachers who cannot out of fear of repercussions from the very same system that they've devoted their lives to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5740)|
| 1:35:50| In the cases of Linda Ables, Jared Henry, Don Breedwell, and Andrew Briggs, that sentiment became all too real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| These are the names of poor Tennessee educators who've lost their lives to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| In addition to the tragic losses of these educators, over 16,000 educators have contracted the virus since the start of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| And thankfully, those educators have recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| The fact that their lives were put in jeopardy in the first place should be something that this board, quite frankly, should be ashamed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| Rather than taking the initiative to ensure that everyone, everything that can be accomplished is being done to ensure the safety of educators, faculties, and students alike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5780)|
| 1:36:29| this education system is both figuratively and literally gambling with the lives of the people that it is meant to serve and uplift, and not from a lack of solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5789)|
| 1:36:40| I will echo the requests and pleas of educators throughout the entirety of this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| We need better ventilation systems in schools for the safety and protection of students, teachers, and faculty alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| We need mask mandates enforced in schools. They're not just for show, they're for everyone's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| We need counselors and mental health professionals on site to help with the mental burdens of this pandemic, and not only just this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5817)|
| 1:37:05| Instead of thrusting these responsibilities upon teachers who are not adequately trained to assist with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| we need teachers and faculties to be fairly compensated for the extra time that they put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| A single $1,000 check, although we are thankful for that, it's a spit in the face to teachers who have been working overtime this entire time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| to provide education for not only the people out in that lobby, but I'm sure some of the people in here who have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| We need to ensure that students can count on Knox County Schools to keep them safe by promoting gun safety in our communities and a decrease in gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5851)|
| 1:37:39| These demands are not outrageous, they are the bare minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| Knox County Schools have the finances and resources available to easily make these requests come to fruition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| so I'm left wondering why these changes aren't being implemented when there are no negatives to any of the requests that I just proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| I'm currently pursuing a degree in music education at Pellissippi State Community College, and I plan on transferring to UT to finish my bachelor's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| Becoming a teacher has been a dream of mine since I was a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| From the moment I took my first violin lesson, and I owe that passion to every single one of the teachers in my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| who encouraged me to love and create music when my entire life was falling apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| I've been told by coworkers, counselors, advisors, friends and family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| all who have discouraged me from pursuing that career in education, warning me of the low pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| warning me of the often unpaid hours, lack of benefits, and increased levels of stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| And even with all of these warnings, all of these cautionary tales from all of the people in my life who I have the utmost respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| I have not doubted for a second that this is what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| However, after seeing how expendable not only the jobs, but the very lives and well-being of teachers in this Tennessee education system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5928)|
| 1:38:57| I find myself second-guessing, for the first time in my life, whether or not this is something I want to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5937)|
| 1:39:04| Myself and many others are struggling to rationalize, working for a system that cannot care less about our own well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| And I fear that once educators finally become fed up with the negligent treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| the only people who will be left to educate the next generation of Tennesseans will be those who only see them as a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| And that is where the end of my speech was. I have a minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| First of all, I would like to thank the Austinese students who are sitting in that lobby who have come out to show their support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| and were able to talk about what happened without tears in their eyes, which I am not able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5971)|
| 1:39:38| The fact that students have to worry about being slaughtered on their way home from school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5978)|
| 1:39:46| is something that everyone in this room and everyone in that lobby should be in tears about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| It is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| I don't have anything else to say besides that, but I hope that resonates with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| And that I don't look away from you. It's just another person complaining at you, because I know you're trying your best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| But this is unacceptable. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Naomi Elliott, and then after that, Kumi Alderman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6011)|
| 1:40:21| If you will state your name and county of residence, and then you'll have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6021)|
| 1:40:32| Hello, Naomi Elliott, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| You'll have to excuse the tears on my face after following that, because it is unacceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| that we are not catering to children more and investing in them more, because that's where it all begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6041)|
| 1:40:48| You're all professionals, or so you should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| So you should have the expertise to know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| Things that happen in childhood carry through to people well into their adulthood and their whole lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6055)|
| 1:41:02| How do you think all this violence starts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| It starts with the young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| I didn't even come to speak about that, but it needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| There's a better way than what's happening now in so many different aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| This mask issue is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| You know, I had to go be segregated into a separate room because of my medical condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| What if that was my race?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| Is it OK then to discriminate against me and other people like me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| If it's against my religion, is that OK to discriminate against me and segregate me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| and deny me my equal rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| What about these students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| That's ridiculous what's happening to the Madrigals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| My friend's daughter had to wait four years to be in the Madrigals, and now she's a senior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| and you have these ridiculous rules that are unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| You let some kids do some things and others, they have to follow stricter rules, and that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6119)|
| 1:42:06| That is discrimination, and you need to step down if you're not going to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| Now, you know these laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Now, you need to teach your employees these laws so they can act accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| Just because businesses are doing it doesn't make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| They think they can get away with the corruption, but you work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| Enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| It's time for a new day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| Sometimes we've got to burn the ships, as for king and country would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6155)|
| 1:42:42| There has to be religious exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Really, you just need to drop the mask issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| If people, as much education is out there on COVID, as much money has been spent and time on the airways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6166)|
| 1:42:54| then we should know what's right and what's wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| according to the people who recommend that advice for our health and public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6178)|
| 1:43:05| We should have that choice, our individual choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| The same way with vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| Some people are allergic to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| Are you going to make it mandatory and discriminate against people who can't get it and shame them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6193)|
| 1:43:21| Or are you going to deny them services that are paid for with taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6201)|
| 1:43:29| That sounds like fraud or a misallocation of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| There are rules that you have to abide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| I don't understand why it's so difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| If you can't read the Civil Rights Act and the ADA Act, and the ADA, I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6221)|

| 1:43:55| I should have been here long ago, and I'm sorry for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| I'm sorry I didn't stick up for these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| It is not right what they're going through at schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| If teachers are too scared or they feel like they're high risk or someone in their family is vulnerable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| they can ask for reasonable accommodations through the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| There's a better way to conduct services right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| These kids need to be educated, and what's going on now is we're teaching them to live in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6257)|
| 1:44:26| Fear is not healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| Something's got to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6268)|
| 1:44:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| Kumi Alderman, and then after that, Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6277)|
| 1:44:58| My name is Kumi Alderman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| Is that okay to take off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Sorry, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| My name is Kumi Alderman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| I'm the executive director of the Asian Culture Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| We organize once in a year educational festival here in the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6309)|
| 1:45:15| In 2019, we had about 60,000 people came, and we really enjoy to unite people and educate the young generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6315)|
| 1:45:26| But I am here to support to wear masks today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| The reason is you see in the whole world news, Taiwan is the first best country right now to protect the kids in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6331)|
| 1:45:43| And what they do is at the school, they actually measure their temperature before they go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| All the parents come over to school, they take a temperature, and then they will separate the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| Then when they go to school, they wear masks, of course, and then they have the stand, plastic stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6356)|
| 1:46:04| Each kid has their own stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| And then after the lunchtime, I think they will go out to eat sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| And in the wintertime, they have their own plastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| Actually, they can see each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| But these are the things they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| And of course, they encourage to wash their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| I think as of now, mask is a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| But science says, like CNN News, Dr. Fauci said, it's only 18.7% people are fully vaccinated, only one-fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6390)|
| 1:46:41| It's not enough for everyone to say no mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| I'm not here to fight anything like other people who don't want to wear the mask, but I'm here to share the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6405)|
| 1:46:54| We have a very, what do you call, specialist here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| You know, Dr. Peter Ta, he invented actually the N95 mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6420)|
| 1:47:10| And he was retired, but he came back to work for us at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6430)|
| 1:47:18| He's from Taiwan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| We are friends, through my friends, his friends, and we kind of get a lot of information from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6440)|
| 1:47:28| And he suggests, the reason I brought this is, this is what I do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6448)|
| 1:47:37| This is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| Every day when I wear the mask, I put it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| And I wrote it two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| So kids and then people who are tired of mask, they could actually have like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6468)|
| 1:47:55| And at home, they say, okay, Monday, this one, Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| And they can start, you know, a little bit more, not the fun, but accept the mask and how to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6478)|
| 1:48:06| Because this mask, everybody say, oh, we bought this, throw it away, waste money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| But we can reuse it, actually rotating the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| That's we want to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| And then also, I would like to share one more technique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| We will put this on the YouTube, but the little kids who has trouble to wear mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6502)|
| 1:48:28| what they can do is, they don't like to wear the mask this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Because you have the hole next and smash on your face, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| So, because they can't breathe, what Dr. Dai suggest was take a stapler and then put this on the side like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6520)|
| 1:48:50| attach to each other, put the three staples here on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| And then this side, three, one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| And then we're going to make a duckling mask like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| Eiga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| It look like a duck, so kids probably like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| But the best, the good resolution is there is no space on the side, so nothing goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6552)|
| 1:49:21| And also, we have more space here to breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| So, this is Dr. Dai invented for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| Its shape is more gloomy inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| So, I hope this kind of activities at the school, so small kids say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| oh, we're going to make a duckling mask and they can put some eyes, whatever they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6583)|
| 1:49:50| But I wanted to encourage kids to wear the mask, and then we need to teach kids why we are wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6590)|
| 1:50:00| We are not wearing a mask to protect you, but we are wearing a mask because we are together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6600)|
| 1:50:09| Okay, I'm going to have to stop you at this point, but thank you very much for coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| Patty King and after Patty King, Hannah Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| And if you would state your name, county of residence, and you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6622)|
| 1:50:32| My name is Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| I'm actually going to speak on behalf of my husband who could not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| He has emailed a couple of you guys this letter I'm about to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| My name is Phil King, and I'm the owner, instructor at Primo Music Instruction here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6641)|
| 1:50:48| I was asked to give you my personal perspective and experience with the subject of wearing masks by performers as a music educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6648)|
| 1:50:56| Please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| I'm nervous, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| I have taught in public and private schools, music programs, both band and choral, as well as a private music academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6659)|
| 1:51:07| And I am presently a private music instructor teaching both vocalists and instrumentalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| Since May of last year, out of 40 students, all but five have returned to in-person lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6673)|
| 1:51:21| We went to virtual for a while, and all but five of our students went to in-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| First, I'd like to address the study of the Colorado State University that seems to be the input of the school board to mandate masks for students in music and other performing art classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6686)|
| 1:51:38| I find it illogic and without merit to base the entire policy on one study that is not corroborated and that is incomplete and ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6698)|
| 1:51:52| And that is to the point of this non-commental that its own findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| At the very beginning of the study, this qualifies itself by stating, while data is lacking, there is developing senses that infectious aerosol particles containing SARS-CoV-2, the virus, that does COVID-19, are partially responsible for the global spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6718)|
| 1:52:20| This admission that the science has not been proven that COVID is transmitted through the aerosol particles, even on a particle basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6740)|
| 1:52:31| And that is already a developing opinion that it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| Furthermore, the study to date makes the following statement about finding the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6756)|
| 1:52:43| Some instruments produce more aerosol than others, but performers are a major determinant of the instrumental in submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6763)|
| 1:52:51| I am a musician as well, okay? I marched through high school band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| You do not send out a lot of particles with woodwind instruments or brass instruments unless you push it out hard, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6775)|
| 1:53:04| I'm going to skip some stuff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| From my own personal experience, during the years I have taught in public and private schools and academies, when the seasons of high flu cases and even during the H1N1 pandemic, mask coverings were never used nor ever discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6787)|
| 1:53:23| And during the H1N1 pandemic, school children and young adults were the most vulnerable age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6803)|
| 1:53:30| I have yet to hear a credible explanation as to why this present COVID flu strain, which is very low risk for school age children, warrant a radical difference response in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6810)|
| 1:53:45| For months, I have been in close contact with, for 30 minutes to an hour, on weekly basis with music students, both vocalists and instrumentalists, and on weekly basis, the students who live in Knox, Jefferson, and Sevier counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6825)|
| 1:54:00| Not one student has been exposed to or caught COVID from me and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| Only one student requires me to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| 39 students, as well as myself, do not wear masks during the lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| And this is in a small room of their home, either a bedroom, kitchen, something like that, where they're not even six feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6854)|
| 1:54:23| I have several students who have been exposed to either contract COVID or through the forensic because of contact tracing in all three counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6863)|
| 1:54:34| All of them were exposed at school where everyone wore a mask all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| At some point, officials are going to have to admit masking coverings are not migrating this virus in a very place where masks are most consistent worn, are very places that there are majority of exposures occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6879)|
| 1:54:54| I understand that it is a music instructor that the most concerned about the exposure from their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6894)|
| 1:55:01| However, the majority of my students who have been exposed were exposed by the instructors, not students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| Hannah Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6912)|
| 1:55:23| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| If it's all right with the with Madam Chair, and you miss that, I'd like to cede my time to the Austinese student, Lauren Seagrave, so that he can finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6925)|
| 1:55:38| That will actually want to give guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| I mean, a member of the board could make a motion in a second to temporarily suspend the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6945)|
| 1:55:52| It's been done in similar situations when somebody wants to speak from outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| I'm just saying that's a similar issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| I mean, yeah, yeah, it's not the same issue, but I mean, you know, the board wants to temporarily suspend its policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| So, I mean, I believe that's what the motion is to to allow what the speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| Yeah, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| I make a motion to accept Miss Kirby's suggestion of ceding her time to allow our student to finish speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6979)|
| 1:56:29| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6995)|

| 1:56:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| Thanks, Miss Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| And Lauren Seagrave, if you'd like to come back and finish speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| Hi, I'm back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7010)|
| 1:56:57| I'll wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| Programs like Project Grad and Project Grad have given $1,000 grants to each student who completes their program and are not academically failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7021)|
| 1:57:10| They increase not just graduation rates of high schoolers in these schools from 50% to 83%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| but also increase the graduation rate of these students going to post-secondary schooling from 30% to 56%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7037)|
| 1:57:25| And the solution is creating and helping these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| In my four years at Austin East, I have never felt unsafe while on its campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| Because despite everyone's opinion of my school, Austin East Magnet High School is an incredible school with hardworking, dedicated teachers and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7054)|
| 1:57:45| And every time someone apologizes to me for going there or makes an offhanded remark about my school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7065)|
| 1:57:55| I am reminded that the fight for these kids, to get these kids an equal opportunity to succeed in this society, isn't over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7075)|
| 1:58:04| The clear backpacks being implemented is not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| The problem is how it paints our school and its students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| No other school in Knox County is implementing this policy besides Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| Where was this action when schools like Central were getting bomb threats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| Threats that actually are targeted to the students on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| Why did you decide not to keep them safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| If you think that clear and mesh backpacks will keep students inside school safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| then this policy should be implemented in other Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| I feel unsafe for my peers that go to Farragut, West, Gibbs and every other school that are kept unsafe by not extending this policy countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7117)|
| 1:58:48| I am advocating for the schools and the students inside them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| I am going to be boycotting these backpacks and I invite my fellow students to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| I am doing this to make a statement that this clear and mesh symbol isn't going to take away their freedom in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7139)|
| 1:59:07| What's next, administrators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| What will your superiors tell you to do next to your students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| Set up metal detectors, search each student before they enter every class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| Why? Because people not associated with Austin East did some evil acts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| To students who want to join me, all you need to bring to school is your Chromebook and a charger with any other material you might need for class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7163)|
| 1:59:31| We will continue this until this rule is mandated for every other high school in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7171)|
| 1:59:36| or funding and programs are provided to this school that desperately needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| I can't let my body forget how to breathe before my fellow classmates and I are labeled as criminals and our necks are being laid upon by an officer's knee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7182)|
| 1:59:53| If you do nothing, this is our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| Are you going to kneel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| Thank you, Mr. Seagrave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| This now concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| Thank you, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| Do we have any comments for board forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| I just want to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| I think there's some confusion in the public about the aerosol study and an idea that it was used to require masks and that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7225)|
| 2:00:35| It was used to allow students to be able to perform because when we looked at our reopening plan and all of the pieces that went with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7235)|
| 2:00:47| music teachers were very concerned that students would not be able to participate effectively in their classes and safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7247)|
| 2:00:56| They reached out to each other and to musicians in other states to find out what they were doing and what could allow them to continue to have performances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7256)|
| 2:01:09| to continue to be able to play their instruments and to continue to be able to sing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| This was not something that was used to restrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| It was exactly the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| I think there's some confusion around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| Any other comments for board forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| Ms. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Thank you, Madam Chair and board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| I just wanted to say I sent an email to the staff earlier this week and thank you about the reopening plan for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| I know I've gotten a couple emails from my community members regarding the fall and how that's going to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7297)|
| 2:01:44| Thank you for working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| I look forward to having open discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| I think that the board, the staff did a great job last year of including the community and having an open discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| So I look forward to those discussions about how next year is going to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7322)|

| 2:02:04| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210310?start=7327)|
