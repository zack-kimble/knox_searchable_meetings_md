| 0:02:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of March 13th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Any questions or comments on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Minutes approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Okay, items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| Councilman Hawkins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| Give me just a minute, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| It's 11-R and 10-B and 11-R. I think we just need to postpone that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=188)|
| 0:03:23| We may have to continue postponing it, but we'll postpone it starting for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| The motion and second is to postpone 10-B and 11-R for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| This is the appeal on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| This is the use on review appeal for the Rivermont site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| Any questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| I just wanted to hear a little bit about the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Well, because there are ongoing discussions, negotiations amongst various parties, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=225)|
| 0:03:54| the doctors that own the site, the city of Knoxville, a developer, a waterfront developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=234)|
| 0:04:02| who's currently developing other waterfront sites, et cetera, trying to find some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| to come to, you know, a meeting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| Any questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| Mr. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Is this the one that the only, I guess, basis we're looking at is it doesn't comply with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| the South Knox waterfront, but it complies with everything else if it came through MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| and the zoning and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Is this the same one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| In essence, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| It's zoned R2, but you can build a, you can only do office in R2 using, doing a use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| So, you can't do it by right, but you can do it with a use on review, and MPC had approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| And so, this is, I think we're talking about the same one, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| All those in favor of postponing for two weeks, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Anything else to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| Joe, is that an old light or is that a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| That's a new light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=303)|

| 0:05:06| I know Council is looking forward to hearing this one of these days, but we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| I would like to ask, or I'm going to make a motion to postpone this for yet another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| 10A and 11Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Any questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Do we think we'll hear it in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| The property owners that got the original variance, which was an appealed, I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=327)|
| 0:05:36| hear from them until I called again today and finally got somebody, and she said, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| is that tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| I thought it was next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| And she said, well, we'll try to have something by next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| So, that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| So, this is a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=349)|

| 0:06:55| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| I've had some people contact just really just one person, expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| And I heard indirectly that someone else had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| But I really don't think this is in our hands to do anything about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| it so I think we just have to move ahead on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| I don't think we have the discretion there to really do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=431)|

| 0:07:16| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| I'd like to ask Mr. Swanson, do we have any discretion here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| Because I've had a complaint about the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| not necessarily anything to do with the people or even anything about the liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| There's no one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| In this kind of case, you're acting in your administrative quasi-judicial capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| and your obligation is to determine whether it meets the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| If it meets the requirements, then you are obligated to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| Location is not one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=471)|

| 0:07:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Several items for a mayor's report very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| I want to invite everybody, this Thursday, March 29th at 1.30 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| we'll have groundbreaking for the new Cisco operation at the I-275 Business Park on Tennessee Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| Go underneath I-275 to get to the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| There will be a tent and lots of balloons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| You can't miss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Everybody is welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| We'd love to have you there for the celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Second thing, on Monday, April 9th, which is before our next meeting as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| ribbon cutting for the Bearden Greenway at the Armory on Sutherland at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| That's Monday, April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Third, another important meeting, the First Creek Improvement Public Hearing will also be April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| Arlington Baptist Church, 1928 Fairmont Boulevard at 5.30 on that Monday, April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| And Brent and Steve and others from our engineering team will be walking us through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| I'd like to also now call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| Whoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| Make a motion, move 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Can I come back to that after Mayor's Report and then we'll come back and I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| I'd like to ask Kristen Manuel and Randy Love to come forward if they would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| Kristen is the City of Knoxville Aquatics Coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| and Randy is a Recreation Center Leader Pool Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| Throughout the whole country, only 1,750 people have ever received the highest lifeguard training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| certification that you can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| No one in Knoxville has ever done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| And I'm pleased to announce that both Kristen and Randy have received that certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| which is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| We have five pools throughout the city, two outdoor and three indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| I got that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Three outdoor, two indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| But anyway, we estimate just in the summer we'll have about 18,000 people use those pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| So having this level of certification is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| It's also very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Like I said, if it's the whole country, only that many people have reached that certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| I think it says something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| So to Kristen and Randy, both of you, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Congratulations for receiving that honor and thank you for what you do for the city every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| to make us a safer and as well as a more enjoyable place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=605)|
| 0:10:14| Yeah, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to make a motion to move 11-F to this point in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| 11-F deals with the recognition of the Austin East Roadrunner Ladies Basketball Team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| which won a state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| And I would love to ask them to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| I'd love to ask Vice Mayor Brown if you'd like to join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| And something tells me some of these girls used to play for one of our senior directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| and if he'd like to come out here, too, he may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| Or if he'd like to just sit there, he can, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=643)|
| 0:11:03| Let me read a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| A lot of you all know about them, but they won the state championship game 57 to 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| When you win a state championship game by 14 points, it says a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| To get there is incredibly difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| To win it is harder, but to win it by 14 points says a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| LaCrystal Goss was the state tournament, I think, MVP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| They were led in the state championship by, I'm going to probably miss this, but Shimanika Marsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| who had 14 points, Tiffany Isom had 13 and 10 rebounds, and Simone Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| who had six points and four rebounds, all of whom made the all-tournament team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| They also received a lot of effort from a lot of girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| This is the first ever state championship by Head Coach Eric Brabson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| They talked a lot about defense and rebounding is what I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| and that that's what won state championships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| So we are very pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| This is the first year ever we've had girls state high school championships from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| and we had two, and the Lady Roadrunners did us proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| And so we congratulate you all in terms of adding to Knoxville sports history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| and adding to the illustrious history of Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=727)|
| 0:12:17| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| In case some of you don't realize it, on that end right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| that young lady looks like Sam Anderson because that's his daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| But I want to also say how proud I am of the Austin East Lady Roadrunners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| and the good job that Coach Brabson has done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| Good quality young ladies, and they did us proud, and we're very proud of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| and I'm proud to call you all once again another jewel in the crown of the Super 6 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| Thank you all, and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| These ladies have a history of winning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| I think they won the AAU championship several times growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| and this wasn't a one-time deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| There's a history of winning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| We will move now to reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Oh, did I miss something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| We need to vote on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| I only do that every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| We voted to move it, so I actually need a motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=788)|
| 0:13:18| Any discussion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| I'll put a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Congratulations, girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Yeah, this is actually starts with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| It's an announcement if the answer is yes, and I don't know if the answer is no, what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| But last night at the county stormwater ordinance workshop, they actually announced a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=819)|
| 0:13:47| It was the Tetris hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| This is, I guess, a question for Brent for April 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| We had talked a lot about this at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| I guess I wanted to ask Mr. Johnson if this hearing is happening and if we know when and where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| It hasn't been confirmed yet, but it looks like it will be on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| We haven't decided on the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| So at some point, probably in the evening of April 12th, there will be a public hearing on the joint city county report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=846)|
| 0:14:15| about the new county stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| So anybody who's interested in stormwater should already write April 12th down in the calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| and we'll figure out that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| I guess it will be posted on the website at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Just a reminder that this Friday in the convention center, Knoxville's convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| we're having our regional conference called Plain Talk on Quality Growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| And the mayor's going to be there, and I think quite a few council members are going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| I just want to remind the public of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| And if anybody's interested in getting more information, go to www.pt, no, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| etqg, easttennesseequalitygrowth.org, etqg.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=899)|

| 0:15:07| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Well, I just have to comment on the commitment of this group of council members and our mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| and his directors that we are once again sitting here in a council meeting when our volunteers are trying to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=914)|
| 0:15:22| in the NCAA tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| So if any of us seem just a bit like we might like to move quickly, that could be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=929)|

| 0:21:43| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Mayor, I would like to propose an amendment to the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| And council members should have been provided this by e-mail today, as well as a hard copy tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| I will read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Mr. Lyons and I worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Dr. Lyons and I worked on this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| This was consulted with Mark Donaldson and MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| And our understanding is this would not constitute a substantive change requiring this to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| I'll read this into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| We would add this statement to Section E in the section that defines the function of the Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| And it would read as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| The Design Review Board's function is not to impose any architectural preferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| In no way are the guidelines meant to bring uniformity in design or approach or to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| specific materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| They are meant to be applied in as flexible a manner as possible to meet the needs of the building designer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| while encouraging that the design respects the context of nearby buildings and streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| The guidelines are thus not a rigid set of rules, but rather a set of key principles to guide development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| The Review Board's task is to provide certainty that both immediate surroundings, as well as downtown as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| are taken into account with each building project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| And I'd like to move to amend with that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1384)|

| 0:23:11| I just asked if there was anybody signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| There's actually no one signed up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| See, Mr. Donaldson walked down front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| He may want to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| I guess the question I have, this was generated today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| We had several folk who have a heavy interest in downtown with us last time who have kind of actually been the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| Columbuses and the folk who forged ahead and got us started downtown and stepped out with their own development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1409)|
| 0:23:37| ideas, their own monies on the line in conjunction with the city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| And I was wondering, has this particular amendment been circulated and discussed with them to see if it deals with any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| of their issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| And I noticed Mr. Goss is here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Would you like to have an opportunity to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| I'd like to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Dr. Lyons, do you want to address Vice Mayor Brown's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Yes, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Last week, Councilwoman Roddy and I discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| And I did take this down and dropped off a copy with Mr. Dewhurst and told Mr. Goss about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| And they've all subsequently looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| And I think they're generally pleased with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| They may have a word or two that they would like to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| But I'll let Mr. Goss, if he wants to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| But it was shared with them, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| May I just ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Because this goes to the statement Ms. Roddy just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| I just want to ask there in line three, the third word from the end of that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| Possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| When you read that, the word was encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| And my copy says insure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| And there's a bit of difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| I wanted to be sure if there's been a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| I'm seeing the word possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| So I'm coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| I'm looking at the e-mail version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| It just, I believe it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| The middle of the fourth line on the document you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| And I'm looking for my e-mail version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| And while insuring that the construction respects the context of nearby buildings and land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| Yes, insuring was what was sent out this afternoon via e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And then there was some response from a committee member who served on the Design Guidelines Steering Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| And he felt that the word insuring was too strong and suggested the substitution of the word encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| So I'm sorry I did not point that out since there was a slight difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| I was reading off the version that was provided at your place by Dr. Lyons and Madeline Weil this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| And that did reflect that committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| I had brought this with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| That's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| I should have pointed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| So insuring became encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| One is a little stronger than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| And that was the feedback that we got on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| That's what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Buzz, would you like to comment on the comment now would be on the amendment that Ms. Roddy just read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| Could you give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Buzz Goss, 121 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| I would like to say that I think that Dr. Lyons has done a fine job in addressing one of the issues that those of us in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| the people who have to live with these guidelines day to day, are concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| And that's sort of the ambiguity built into the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| And this seems to at least set a direction that hopefully can be institutionalized such that we won't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| vagarities of political boards that begin to play and come into focus in later days, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| after we've all lost our vigilance, if you will, and we're still trying to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| So, again, I want to encourage you to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| I hope we can still talk about the guidelines afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Anything else on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Those two lights, I'm going to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| We're ready to vote then on the amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Now we're discussing the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| I want to say I want to just take a second to thank Mr. Goss and Mr. Dewar for really leading off the really good discussion two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| weeks ago about this and have had some follow-up discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| And I know there's some ideas that I think are going to come out tonight about next steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| but I want to sort of say in my mind when we adopt these guidelines tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| it will be a significant accomplishment for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| I mean, this is something we've been talking about for 15 or 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| After tonight, we will have downtown guidelines, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| But I also hope that we can keep the idea of these being not written in stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| continuing to develop as we learn more, as we review these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| and especially a good way to do a review, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| a year down the road is always a good chance to take a hard look at what we've learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| and continue to improve these until we get what we want completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| These are an A, I think, as guidelines go, and close enough for us to gain for an A plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Barbara, is that an old light or a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| It's an old light, but I'll just comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Because my thoughts go along the same track that Councilman Becker has just expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| And I was considering, you know, a timeline for a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| And while he was talking, it occurred to me this council definitely sits here through December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| you know, most of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| A nine-month review would be a wise thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| because we are the ones who will take some responsibility for having accepted these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| And it just appears to me that we might like to be sure that we are the ones who can review that after a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| That's just a comment and a thought for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| Thanks, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Mr. Gossett, I think you said you wanted to comment on the back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| Now the motion is amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Yes, thank you, Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| First of all, I should apologize for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| I was caught by two separate new property owners, new homeowners downtown who just wanted to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| they love their houses and they wanted to chat about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| And so it took me a moment to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| But I fully intended to come down and sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| I want to begin by saying, do you need my address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| No, you're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| I want to begin by saying that I came away from our meeting two weeks ago feeling that those of us who were really out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| saying, hey, wait a minute, slow down a second, give us a moment to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| I came away respected and that we had a great conversation and that even though the nine of you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| decided to do what we'd asked you not to do, that you did it out of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| contemplation and consideration and really paid attention to what we had to say, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| Now back to the issue of the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| I started off two weeks ago by saying we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| and that still holds true today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| I spent the last two weeks trying to really think this through and make sure I understood exactly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| what I thought was correct and why I thought it was correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| and that I could communicate to you where we were coming from and some of our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| and hopefully that could be, you know, come part of the process and help us implement these things correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| because I know that everybody, we had 14, no, 16 members of the development community in downtown signed that letter to you two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| weeks ago and those are the people actually doing it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Day to day we're out here dealing with these things and nobody wanted to kill this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1842)|
| 0:30:53| Everybody wanted it implemented but in maybe a slightly different way than what's presented right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| Let me just back up just a little bit here and give you a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| I have lived downtown since 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| I bought my first development project in 1992 and since that point we've done, we will cross two million square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| No, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| I wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| A million square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Well, that includes, you know, Chattanooga now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Not just properties that we've done work in but a million square feet of having converted lofts as both the architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| and developer and but also, you know, so we've been the architects, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| And I have that hat but I'm also a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| We bought properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I own 90,000 vacant square feet on Gay Street today of which 30,000 you helped me with two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| That's the Crimson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| And so I think that we look at this thing with a perspective that nobody else can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| There are six different constituencies I think that they're involved in what this document embodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| The first one and foremost is, you know, the staff and the steering committee, the folks who actually put it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| And then there's the political aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| That would be the administration that believes it's the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| and you as council here who's going to vote for it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Up or down, I don't know which way you're going yet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| And then there's folks who live and work downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| I'm sorry, work and play downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| So people are not here all the time but they love it and they're here because they do love it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| and they like working downtown and running into their buddies at the dressing room at the Men's Y| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| or hanging out at the brew pub on the patio that we all love to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| There are the people who have their homes downtown, people not just renters but have bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| You know, they've invested their livelihoods in a home in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| Then there's the development community who, you know, buy like David Dewhurst or Jeffrey Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| And there's a host of others, Lee Birch who was a trailblazer in and of himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| And then the architectural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| That's six different constituencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| And I actually represent four of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| I live downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| I work and play downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| I'm an architect and a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| And I think that's a unique position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| And I guess that comes with it, I think, a burden, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| But not one that's hard to bear, one that I, in fact, enjoy or else I wouldn't be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| But it's really hard to convey everything that I can see that not everybody else can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| And so I look at this document and I worry about the same things that Councilperson Roddy conveyed to me last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2014)|
| 0:33:42| that, you know, we have to protect against the worst that might come next year or the year after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| And I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| I personally don't fear it and I don't think we necessarily need to regulate against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| but I respect that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| I worry about the worst of what this document can become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| And that is a really loaded and political and bureaucratic system that slows down the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| And it doesn't really function in the way that we intend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| And I have no doubt that when Dr. Lyons says, no, we're here to make this flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| and we're here to make sure it gets done right, we're going to be vigilant against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| I have no doubt that when Councilperson Roddy says that to me that that's what she means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| and that every one of you mean that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| But, you know, we're not all going to be here for the rest of our lives, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| We're going to serve our time and move on and do whatever comes next in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| And so there's always the fear in my mind that we're going to run into that down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| And, you know, in the past, I've been lucky enough to work on more buildings than anybody else downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| both as architect and developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| And hopefully that trend will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I'll be lucky perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| And, you know, I'll be suffering that fate down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| And that's what I worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| That's what I'm here to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Let's be very careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| And so from that perspective, I went back and looked at this document one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| One more minute, boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| You didn't tell me there was a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| And I would appreciate the opportunity to sit down and consider how this document might be tweaked just slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2109)|
| 0:35:19| and actually get it to where I think is the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| And I'm not here trying to say, look, I want to make my life easier because it's not easy what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| It would be easier to buy a farm and the burbs and, you know, stick houses on it or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| I just want to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| And that's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| And so I would ask for some time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| It's been suggested that perhaps a prudent thing to do is to adopt these things and then at some point down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| and go back and revisit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| Well, I would say that perhaps a really conservative prudent step would be to make them volunteer in the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| and then have a moment, I mean a sunset, a moment, six months, nine months, whatever that is down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| where we go, okay, it's time for us to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| And unless there's real cause, then we're going to make them mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| And I think during that period of time, we could actually really work it out and tweak the pieces that, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| I truly believe are just slightly off the mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| I'm a sailor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| I have a shirt on from one of my sailing trips recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| And the one thing that I know about sailing is when you sail, you set a tack and you go a long distance before you change course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| And if you're just a half a degree off, when you get out there at the end of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| and you're ready to make your next tack, you could miss your island, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| You could miss your island by miles and miles and not even be able to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| And I think perhaps that's what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| If any one of the 16 people that signed that letter had been on this steering committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| and I think that was set up in good faith and I have no criticism about that, but I think it missed the voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| The voice that could have helped just get it just a little bit better and that we wouldn't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| I wouldn't be here saying, hey, let's not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| I'd be saying, let's do it as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| I think I stole 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Well, I guess just one, just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| I'm actually kind of glad we didn't get it right so you can be here and continue to push us to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| I just want to respond to Mr. Goss and say I think all of us on this council, I hope I speak for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| and all of us that worked on the steering committee, welcome input in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| I think we want it to be a living document that continues to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| But because we've worked on it for over a year and I think we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| I can vouch for the fact that the steering committee was so thorough in our best practices survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| we may have gotten some things wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| But I personally feel like it's time to give it a test drive and whether, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| maybe it's nine months, as Councilwoman Pilo suggested, and in December take another look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| and see how it's functioning in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| You know, Dr. Lyons said to me today that his office would be glad to take responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| for keeping a log of the requests that come before the design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| I'm sure that council could be provided minutes of the meeting of that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| And, you know, just as Mr. Goss said that, you know, we're not going to be around forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| and the developers and the architects who are doing the work now won't be around forever either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| And I think we've benefited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Downtown has benefited tremendously from the talent and the inspiration and the dedication that folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| that signed this letter that you present have given us in terms of downtown development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| But we don't know what the future holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| And I think, if anything, this document attempted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| or to put into words what we loved about what was happening in downtown right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| what we loved about what our current pool of talent was doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| and to codify that in a sense and affirm that in hopes that that would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| So my request to this council would be to approve this document on second reading tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| give it a test drive, ask Dr. Lyons' office to monitor the progress of the review board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| and provide us with minutes, and then take a second look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| And in the meantime, certainly, Dr. Lyons' office could meet with Mr. Goss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| and other interested folks and, you know, see where those tweaks might need to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| But I would support approval this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Any other comments before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| He walked down like he wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| And if he doesn't, I think we'll all be quite happy, but we love hearing from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| I'd like you to give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| And Buzz used one of your minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| David Dewhurst, 133 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| And I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| I went on vacation the week before last, and I took this darn document with me and read it on the beach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| And my wife thought I was nuts for the twelfth time reading this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| And I came away, maybe unlike Buzz, we have a few differences ourselves in debating this thing back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| As you all said about worrying about that least common denominator development that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| I've been a huge supporter of wanting to push this forward precisely because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| Because I think we can make some fundamental mistakes downtown, and I want to make sure those things don't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| And so for that reason, I've been very supportive of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| However, there's still a number of things that concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| There are a lot of words used in here like complement architectural styles, enhance things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| What I think complement means and what somebody else thinks complement means, what bothers me is we go to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| board, which takes a lot of time to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| And really my main issue is not necessarily what's written here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| All this is really nice language and it all flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| My main problem is, as a developer, and I've got to go already run through a whole litany of bureaucracy to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| building permit and get started with things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| It's having to have another unknown when I submit documents to go forward and to find a way to sift out those problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| developments and problem issues, but to proceed quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| And part of what I see here is, you know, my definition of complementary may run afoul of a handful of folks who sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2485)|
| 0:41:37| on a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| I've seen it happen with the Historic Zoning Commission on a number of things where I think they go on for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| hours at a time, maybe not hours, but a lot of time debating some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| You're like, oh, my God, is there not better things to do with your day than to move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| But from the developer's standpoint, it is having to submit that, having to wait and see whether or not is this going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Have I met these conditions that I don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Is this complementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Does it fit with these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| And the two things, I came up with a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| One was, you know, can I submit for a building permit at the same time that I submit an application to this design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| review board so that both of those processes go on in parallel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| And I really don't know the answer to that when I read this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| I'm currently working on probably the largest residential development in downtown right now in the old Hamilton National Bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| And I read this and I thought, well, my God, this is a $14 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| It costs probably higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Do I need to go to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Is that a major project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Well, on the one hand, it seems like certain that it certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| It's the most extraordinarily large project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| But on the second hand, I read through this and I saw that, well, you don't have to go if it doesn't involve major structural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| It doesn't involve facade, major facade changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| It doesn't you don't have to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| There's an exception built in here if you don't have, you know, changing window shapes and sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| We're doing none of that at that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| So do I need to go to this board to talk about that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| I was left confused by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| My main issue is, is there a way that we could take this thing from an administrative standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2597)|
| 0:43:25| Can we take this thing to staff at MPC and throw our plans out and tell them what we want to do and have them look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2605)|
| 0:43:34| and go not just is this minor and then there's a parenthesis in here that says windows and a few minor things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| but whether it's a $14 million project or a $10,000 project, can we get it to the point where I can walk this up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| city county building and have the staff look at it, even if they took, whether they took an hour or they took a few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| and came back and said, yeah, there's nothing controversial about what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Here's your certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Get on with your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| That's what I'd like to see because I think everything that I'm going to bring to this board is probably going to follow all these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| But what I think is going to be difficult is having to file an application, waiting for that review to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2647)|
| 0:44:17| waiting for to sit in front of this board where, you know, maybe we're going to argue about window mullion issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2657)|
| 0:44:26| or something that's just has nothing to do with the building design process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| and permitting that these things could go on in parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| And I wonder if there's just a way that's an easy way to streamline it and we can avoid a lot of the uncertainty of having to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| to the board and just get a signature for this if there's nothing controversial, regardless of the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| And the third issue comes back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| Hey, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| You need to wrap up in about 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Thanks again, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| It goes back to the issue of getting Crandall Rambula, who, you know, we've hired in the city, who is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| I think you might hear tonight that we've got a group in town that hired them the first time that's willing to hire them again to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| And these guys are the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Let's get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| I'm willing to live by their recommendations and what they see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| In a letter that they sent me, they had a very different approach to the administrative side of this than what's proposed in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2714)|
| 0:45:22| And that, to me, is the most important thing, not necessarily what's all the nice words in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| That's the kind of thing that I think it's okay to wait just a little bit of time to make sure we get that implementation phase right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| because that's where the delay comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And that's what costs dollars in real time and hopefully not an impediment for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Actually, Councilman Becker was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| That's a rare thing to be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Anyway, I didn't mean it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| Moving right along, a couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| I think the idea of a Crandall-Arambula review is an interesting idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| and I think more information always makes this better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Mr. DeWitt, it's kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| As you were sitting here talking about sort of that big project that doesn't fit all the guidelines and what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2769)|
| 0:46:17| it's real similar to a discussion I had this afternoon about it's actually item 12C on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| infill housing guidelines for Oakwood-Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| and a real similar feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| We have to set up something to prevent the worst of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| but how bad does that impact the people who are doing the right things from the get-go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| And I actually checked, and there actually is, as I read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| and Dr. Lyons on 3D of the whatever section, private development section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| it actually has some language that staff may approve something when they find it meets the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| And I think that's an important piece to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| something that says if you come in and you're doing the right thing, it's not even 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| We can get this done real quickly and get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| The most important thing I wanted to say is the language in here about the design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| I guess this goes to the mayor because it says it shall be appointed by the mayor with the approval of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| I think that's an important set for us to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| I know the mayor will be thoughtful about who to propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| and council will chew on that because I think getting the right eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| or ten people, whatever it is, is going to be important for how this works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| So I want to make sure we make that an important discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| Now, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Let Joe go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| Yeah, I'll be glad to let Joe go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And your last comment that I wanted to jump in on, I do think that's a very important piece, the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| It's not only important from the front end, but some of the things that Mr. Goff and Mr. Dooher spoke to also speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2865)|
| 0:47:53| while we may start this review committee out with all good people and good intentions on the front end, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| my term is up in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| If everybody else here who gets reelected, they've got, you know, four and a half, five, six years, and then we're all gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| And if we have a process here, there's another layer of bureaucracy that could potentially cause problems to development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| downtown and those committee folk get turned over, what do we have in our --what do we have in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| We have a barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| I've got a problem with, and I said it last time, with some of the things that we've been doing lately and adding in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| It seems like everything we've been doing, which are great ideas and nobody disputes that we need these design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| downtown, they're going to be very beneficial, going to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| And some of the other things that we've been doing, but it seems like every time we do one, I'm seeing a pattern of what bothers me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| a layer of bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| We've got to add in a committee in there, a group of folk who actually weren't elected by the people, a group of folk that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| you know, averaged Joe's sis and didn't ask them to speak for them, didn't ask them to voice their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| didn't ask to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| They asked us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| You know, every time we put one of these kind of process together, we're putting a committee that someone has to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| before they even go to MPC or simultaneously when they go to MPC or before they appeal to us, before they go to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| so I see we're doing some layering here that I'm not very comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| I'm not very comfortable with what the impact could be downtown with having just another layer of bureaucracy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| I do think it's a good idea to have the Crandall organization and those guys take a look at this if they're willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| I remember when they first came through and all the work that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| People were carrying that around town like it was the golden, you know, like it was the Bible or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| You know, this was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| This was it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| We carried it and, you know, highlighted it and marked it, and, you know, this was going to be the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| So maybe now not to look to them for some of their genius and some of their input on it, maybe an error on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| We depend an awful lot on what they did, and a lot of folks, you know, carried that to the bank, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| So I think it's a good suggestion that maybe we buy us a little time and get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| because I am very concerned with the whole influx of what we've been doing here lately with these committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| and you have to go through this commission or that commission or this review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| And also, quite frankly, if we look back, we've been doing a lot of these kinds of very unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| and very, I think, forward-thinking processes of having community meetings and coming forward with ideals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3021)|
| 0:50:29| and plans, and we say we've got to get them implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| And it doesn't take long before we're here amending something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| I mean, we're amending something tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| It's not an indictment of it, but, you know, we did a thing with regards to Cumberland Avenue the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| and now we're having to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| We moved very quickly because we were scared something bad was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Now we're having to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| I don't want us to move so quickly because we're afraid something bad is going to happen and do something bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| You know, I think it doesn't hurt us to postpone this maybe two weeks, four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| however long it takes to let the Crandall-Randall crew take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| to hear some of the specific concerns of the guys who are downtown doing this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| I don't want to see that hindered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| I don't want Mark Brown quoted as saying he's against downtown design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| Somebody's going to say that out there, and he wants to kill downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| But, you know, that's the risk I take being elected to stand up here and speak what I think is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| You know, so hopefully someone will hear that what I'm saying is not that I'm against the downtown design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| not that I do not think it's a good idea, not that I do not think that those folks worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| not that I do not appreciate all the hard work that's been done, but that I'm saying we've got an opportunity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| to maybe tweak it and get it right on the front end before we send this process out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| And why don't we just take advantage of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| So after everybody talks, whether it catches any, you know, a second or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| I'm probably going to make a motion that we do postpone to allow an opportunity for an additional review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| and also continue discussions because these gentlemen here, one thing I've been impressed about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| and all the developers that signed on, they not only did developing downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| but they live down there or have lived down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| They've raised their families down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| They are invested not only in making a dollar and trying to do good development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| but they're raising their families there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| And that speaks volumes to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Some developers get the book and run and go to the next project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| These guys have invested downtown, and that tells me that they're just as concerned as we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| with making sure that downtown is Knoxville's, is everybody's downtown and is everybody's neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| And I think we've got an opportunity to do that by making this document a great document in the next two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| and not saying let's wait six or seven or eight months and see how many folks have a problem with the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| or how many $14 million or $15 million projects we stop in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| So, my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| I really want to echo some of the comments Vice Mayor Brown made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| And as I said last two weeks ago, you know, when it comes when I hear people concerned about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| delays and the cost of time and a bureaucracy, and without going into all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| the idea of sending it back to Crandell or Ambula to have them review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| I was wondering what my colleagues and the key supporters of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| and who have been involved mainly in the process would have to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| And then I may have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| Yeah, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| I'd like to call on Dr. Lyons just because he and I had a discussion about this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| and I think he could probably synthesize better the steering committee, the work of the steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| and how it relates to that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I mean, I understand the genesis of this all was with Crandell and Ambula who suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| that we do embark on design guidelines and, of course, have done a lot of this work in Portland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| and been involved heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| We had an opportunity, in fact, at the beginning to go to them to prepare these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| and we decided to take our own approach and use the staff who we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| I guess my feeling is that at this point, to stop and go to them, I do not think really adds a lot of value to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3246)|
| 0:54:15| I think I would rather follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| This is easy enough to change, and I guess the amendment process, if we find something, is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3257)|
| 0:54:25| I would also add on the administrative end, we're talking about promulgating administrative rules to follow here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| These rules can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| They can be developed, and if you read this, that's part of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| A lot of the questions that I appreciate David and Buzz raising them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| my intention always has been that it go simultaneously so that you're not lining up processes one after the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| and not cause any time delay, that this should not cause a time delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| Well, this is something that needs to be built into the administrative procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| What I see is a lot, as Mr. Duher said, if the concern is in the implementation and in the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3293)|
| 0:55:00| that is something that comes later that we can have them take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| and suggest administratively how to streamline this and make this work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| Because what I'm hearing is it's not with the substance of what's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| And so I guess I don't see a point to delaying this for substantive considerations, which in trying to solve a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3311)|
| 0:55:20| which is basically an administration and implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| I would think it would be a good idea to pass this, send it on while we and as we do the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| And it's very easy to change administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| These can be done if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Counsel can be given a report on what they are regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| I would assume you would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| And they can be altered very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| So I see this as very easily easy to tweak where the concerns are at the point of moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3339)|
| 0:55:48| Dr. Lyons, let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| About two weeks ago, I mentioned I was going to get with some of the developers and look for solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| And one of the things I heard is they were eager and had the funding to send this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| And I really don't understand what the harm would be in a couple of weeks or a month delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| And I know a lot of my colleagues up here have a lot of respect for this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| And I don't know, you know, is there a reason that we need to do this immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| What would the harm be just to wait a couple of weeks or a month or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| Well, I think when, again, that's the essence of, you know, the point, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| It's, you know, we've waited this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| You can make a really reasonable argument, well, you know, why can't we wait a few more weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| I think that it's more than a couple week delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| If you find any substantive changes that they suggested, we'll have to go back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| back for another first reading and back for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| It's nothing but that is required of this if that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| David, how long do you think it would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| Just the ballpark, two weeks, a month, no more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| Probably not more than four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| But, Dr. Lyons, I would say that if we're going to find those problems, it's better to find them now than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| Well, and let me, my key, one of my key issues is what we were talking about earlier about a bureaucracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| because I have seen the good intentions of boards going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| and I just know the nature of them to become sort of self-serving, and you mentioned political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| And that's my thing is I don't know what the solution is, but I am looking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| I applaud all the people that served on this, and I respect the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| but I really would like to see if there is any solutions out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| where we could avoid what some of the concerns are about delays and the cost of time and the questions involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3461)|
| 0:57:49| And we talked earlier, you know, the mayor and a lot of members on council ran on the platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| of trying to pave a clear path to City Hall to do business with Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| And I think we've made great strides there, and I think this is another major step in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| But I just want to see it done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| So is, you know, if anybody has any comments or solutions, if not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| I'd be interested in seeing it postponed and sent back to Cramwell-Arandula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| I believe you're, Councilman Hoek, was your light was next, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| Well, I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns, and I'll try to address some of the things that I've heard so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3505)|
| 0:58:36| One is the bureaucracy and the issue of boards having excessive control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| If you look at the boards that we have the most interface with, I would say it would be the NPC and the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3522)|
| 0:58:51| And the criticism I hear the most is that not that they're too restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| but rather that they're, I hear more criticism that they're too permissive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| And usually what comes before this council is an affirmative, an appeal of an affirmative decision from one of those boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3544)|
| 0:59:14| That's my, you know, I haven't gone back and tabulated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| But I would say just from, you know, just sort of thinking about it and observing at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| rather than actually going back and doing a tally, that most of those appeals have been for affirmative decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| So I don't know that we've historically had a lot of that with those boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| Now, the Historic Zoning Commission is a different situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| because their decisions cannot be appealed to anybody but a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| And so we never see those decisions, so we don't interface with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| So that's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| But I just don't know that there's that much evidence of sort of heavy-handedness abuse by boards in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3591)|
| 1:00:04| In terms of what future councils might do, future mayors, future administrations, future NPCs, future councils might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3604)|
| 1:00:16| That's always a concern, but we have no control over what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| We have no control over whether or not they create design guidelines, whether they strengthen design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| weaken design guidelines, hear appeals, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| I think what we can do, though, is put something in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| And historically, I think we as a council know that once something is in place, if it seems to be solid and valid, we honor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3636)|
| 1:00:45| And I would hope that future councils would do the same, that traditionally our way of operating in our culture is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3645)|
| 1:00:53| not challenge those things that seem to have solidity and value to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| And so, again, I don't think that there's evidence that abuse is likely to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3659)|
| 1:01:08| It's always a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| People change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| And I think we set the table and help, by doing that, we help determine what future councils do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| We create the culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| We create expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| We create a modus operandi, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| And those future councils hopefully will respond and follow over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| And that, I think, is the best we can do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| Concerning Crandall or Ambula's input, I got an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| Mr. Dewhurst sent an e-mail, apparently, to several councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| Not all councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| I looked at the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Unless he blind copied to some, he sent it to several council members today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| saying that Cornerstone Foundation would fund, you know, Crandall or Ambula's review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3713)|
| 1:02:01| And so, first of all, I called Lawrence Tullock at Cornerstone Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| and he acknowledged having had a conversation with Mr. Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| And what he said was, we don't want to take a side on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| We're not saying anybody's right or anybody's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| Merely that we've had good experience working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| We felt like we'd laid the groundwork with Crandall or Ambula and we're offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| And I said, so you're just putting an offer on the table to fund this if there's an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| And he said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| We're not pushing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| We're just saying if everybody wants it, we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| If you don't want it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| And then I called George Crandall this afternoon and talked to George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| I know George fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| And had, I think, a very good conversation with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| And George, I don't think I've heard anything tonight that conflicted with what I heard from George other than the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| George is willing to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| He said, we'd be certainly interested in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| He said, we looked at it before the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| You know, I think Mr. Dewhurst contacted George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| And George said they took a look at him, a cursory look at him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| They saw a lot of good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| They saw some things that they thought might be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| And he said they would be very willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| When I asked him about a time frame, I asked him if 30 days was enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| And he said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| He didn't believe that was enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| He said, if you were to postpone for two weeks, we might be able to give you an idea then of how long it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3811)|
| 1:03:41| and how much it would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| But he said, depending on the depth of the review, which is what I think Dr. Lyons had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| depending on the depth of the review and all that, it could take a substantial amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3829)|
| 1:03:56| And I guess where I'm at on this is I think that there's value and great value in what Crandall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| or Amblin has brought to this city and what they could bring to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| I don't think it negates the value of what's already been done in this process and in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3846)|
| 1:04:13| This is not a perfect document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| I think it's, I don't think necessarily the way to deal with it is to sort of second-guess it, to try to re-digest it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3856)|
| 1:04:28| re-digest it, process it, and then come up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| I think my preference would be to approve it with the understanding that we don't wait a year necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3870)|
| 1:04:39| We, however we want to structure it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| we agree that this is an amenable document and that we will move forward with the understanding that if further input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3883)|
| 1:04:53| if folks feel that further input is needed, let's go ahead and pursue the input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| If somebody wants to pay for input, that is their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| But that could be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| But I think there's real value in putting something in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| And I think if we don't, we do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| We devalue a lot of hard work that's been done and we put off to a later date that we really can't determine at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3912)|
| 1:05:27| any final decision on this, and that could be months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| And, I mean, it could be six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| And I'm not comfortable with waiting that long to put something in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| but I am comfortable with passing something and saying, let's take it to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| Let's review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Let's get input, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| Normally, in some cases, I should say I would be happy with saying let's go back and look at it again before we pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| I'm not really comfortable doing that with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| I think that's not the best way of proceeding ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| Well, I have to agree a lot with what Vice Mayor Brown said and Councilman Bailey on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3962)|
| 1:06:10| You know, as of late, we've had a lot of, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| had a lot of layers of bureaucracy in lots of areas when it comes to these redevelopment plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| and stuff such as what we're looking at here for these downtown guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| I, for one, don't think that I want to be part of adding additional layers of bureaucracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| and hoops for businessmen to have to try to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| I think we, you know, we need to try to streamline government and make it easier for developers to be able to do work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=3996)|
| 1:06:45| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| And I'm not convinced that that's what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| But I do think it does add another hoop that these folks would have to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| I guess I wanted to deal Mr. Bailey had a wonderful question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| I think you said, you know, if we can make this better, what's the harm in waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| And I think that's a really good way to ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| In my sense, I think it's a close call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| My sense is if we put the guidelines in mandatory now and they're a little too, you know, they're a little over the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4033)|
| 1:07:22| what happens is I guess what David Dewhurst said is somebody gets in an argument about the windows, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| And it goes back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| And there's no permanent harm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| You know, it aggravates him, the developer, and I think that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| But it's not a permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| My worry would be if we don't put them in, if we do wait or I think, frankly, even Mr. Goswell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| if we don't make them voluntary, the problem there is somebody comes in and builds another blank wall along a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| which is permissible now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| And I just think that while that's not likely, we haven't had that threat for a year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| I worry that we get the really bad awful of not doing anything is much worse than a really bad awful of moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4075)|
| 1:08:03| So while I understand the question, I think it does make sense to adopt these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| We are serious about looking at them again in actually like nine months, that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| But quicker if we can, really to say how do we get them up to the level we need to do, both in what they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| and for what Steve says about getting the bureaucracy as streamlined as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| Well, I'll have to echo a lot that has been said in the sense that I can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| I certainly could argue either side of this question and this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| And I can imagine myself on either side of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| But having watched the development up to this point of downtown, I just think we've been darn lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4124)|
| 1:08:55| I just think we've been darn lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| We haven't had the awful, the terrible side of down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| We have basically, because of the people who have been involved in the process, had wonderful people involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| committed people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| We've had actually we've sat through two administrations that have had very committed to seeing that the very best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4150)|
| 1:09:19| happened downtown and understanding that this is just a core value of Knoxville's potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4159)|
| 1:09:28| And so, consequently, I'm getting concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| We've just recently had a terrible situation occur with one property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| that we had all been so enthusiastic about watching that revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| And that's going to have to happen in a totally different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| I don't have crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| I can't see what's about to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| But in regard to going back to Crandall Arambula and allowing them to consider this, at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4189)|
| 1:09:56| we are where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| And I think we always have to remember that as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| We have to act on where we are, not where we might have been or how we might have gotten here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| And we did not elect to engage them on that front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| We have now invested a year's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| We've kind of waited for a year to determine just how this is all going to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| And, consequently, I think it's putting even them, even Crandall, in a very difficult position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| because they have not been involved in all of the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| They have not engaged in all of the different discussions that have come to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| And I believe that this steering committee, I believe that the administration has acted on behalf of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| who have been involved in that public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| and who have been actively participating in coming to the point where this document was prepared for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| Consequently, I would really like to see us move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| I've talked to Dr. Lyons today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| I've talked to him and I've heard from him, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| And I believe in that conversation we discussed concerns that I voiced, others have voiced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| in regard to the committee and to the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| And I think, as I recall, you committed to providing us with all of the information we need on a regular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4282)|
| 1:11:32| frequent basis about what has come to that committee or that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| And would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| I think I will keep very detailed records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| I'd like to, and in follow-up, I'd like to briefly speak to, well, how do you get it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| I mean, you know, the way you get a car right is you get a model out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| and you observe it over a year and then you adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| You never get it right by designing it forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| It's got to be out and on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| You've got to get feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| You've got to get feedback from people using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| So we're sort of going under the assumption that in the abstract we can get it right without getting it really close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| and trying it out and making the adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| I'll also say that, yeah, we did talk about having Crandall and Rambula do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| To have them substitute their judgment now, as expert as they are from afar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| would almost be like farming out somebody to write design guidelines, you know, a thousand miles away, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| or we're putting them in the position of second-guessing a process that went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| And I think we decided rather than to engage them, and there was a lot of discussion of engaging them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| that we had people with them on the ground, people here with the expertise that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| and with all the research being done in all the other cities, we could get very, very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| And I think we're in a position now to have a continuing observation and tweaking as we see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| I don't see how one tweaks without trying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| To me, that isn't the best way that you get something right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| It's putting it on the ground and then seeing how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Well, thank you for confirming this sort of thought process that was coming to me as this discussion was moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| And, you know, I want to say I have such tremendous respect for everyone, every player that has been involved in what has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4385)|
| 1:13:14| miraculously happened in a short period of time downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| I mean, I just have to say five years ago I thought, well, you know, maybe a few people will think it's kind of cool to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| down here and we'll see how it goes with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| And I'm just extraordinarily pleased and amazed at the continued interest in all the properties downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4409)|
| 1:13:37| So I just would like to see us as a council go ahead, step forward, take this step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| and with the understanding that we are all going to stay very close to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| And I think we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| I think when we had to consider the Crimson building last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| and we had to look at that as a very unique property and a very unique opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| You know, I think you saw the interest of the elected officials in making that work in the very best way it could for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4442)|
| 1:14:11| developer, for the city, for this entire process that's ongoing with downtown redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4451)|
| 1:14:19| So maybe I'm a risk taker, but I'm getting older and I don't have a whole lot of time out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| So I'm thinking, well, let's just go ahead and see where we do on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| But I really think to delay it much longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| and hearing Councilman Hawkins discuss a possible timeline really does concern me greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| So I'm inclined to support this with the understanding that we all need to be on top of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| and we know you will be as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| So that's crucial to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| And then with the appreciation to all who have been involved in this public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| because many people have really weighed in on that and participated in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| At the risk of sounding xenophobic and insular, but, you know, what do you call an expert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| Somebody not from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| In part, I don't mean to put down Crane to Arambula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| but I certainly don't mean to put down the work of the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| and the work of the people who have served on this committee for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| in formulating this document and how we've gotten us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4525)|
| 1:15:35| There has been successful development in other areas of town with overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| whether conservation or historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| With the implementation of those overlays, the candy factory is moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| Forth and Gill, Old North Knoxville, Tazewell Pike, Fairmont, Emerland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| The world has not stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| The world has not come to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| We're at the point where we need to paraphrase Dr. Lyons, take this out for a drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| and see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| We have come back and we have modified overlays in parts of town such as Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| I can think of two or three times since I have been on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Do you get it perfect right the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| How do you find out if you've gotten it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| You try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| That's where I support going forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| Tonight, like I said, people go through this process on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| They go through this process to receive tax increment financing, payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| People are willing to go through processes to do things right and to receive benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| And I think this is something certainly worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Not to belabor this any longer, but I've heard Councilman Hulk's comments on the time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| and I certainly don't want to throw the thing into a tailspin and, you know, postpone it for another six months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| And I wanted to sort of ask our Christopher Columbus, is that what you called him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| David and Buzz, what would you think about if we did go ahead, we pass it, we're going to keep a report card on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| we send this to Crandell Arambula, we let them review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| You know, it's a --" I don't know what the word I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| It's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| It's a living document, so to speak, I guess, and that we go ahead and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4645)|
| 1:17:32| I don't want to go back on my comments a minute ago, but I definitely don't want to delay this thing any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| But I do want to just recommend to the administration and the mayor that if, when we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| that the mayor take a real close look at who he appoints on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| It needs to be a diverse board made up of men and women from all facets of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4669)|
| 1:17:57| not just the ones that seem to have these sensitivities and kind of a know-better-than-you attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| It needs to be a good, broad base of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| So I think I'm going to go ahead and support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| So, you know, the last is very quick before we go to votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| You know, when I made my comments earlier about, you know, not being pictured or being categorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4692)|
| 1:18:20| as not appreciating folks' work, you know, the latter comments make me think that that's exactly what's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| I don't see asking Crandell Arambula to be involved as devaluing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| I see it as adding value, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Going back to the issue, the example about get a car and let's put it on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| To me, that's the reason we got defective products out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| because somebody who was making the car didn't talk to the person who laid out the blueprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| and decided I'm going to build it and send it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Crandell Arambula laid out the blueprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| What's the problem in asking him how do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| You know, that's why we have defective vehicles now running on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| I still haven't heard a good answer to why today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| There's no major project downtown that's coming forward that we've got to make sure that this particular developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| is not going to do right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| I mean, I just don't see anything why today except for it's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| Let's give it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| We'll come back and amend it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| And that's all I've really heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| I am going to still make my motion that we postpone for two weeks to allow us an opportunity to explore the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| of hearing more from the guys downtown about their input and what they're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| and also with regards to maybe seeing if we can talk to the individuals who laid the blueprint out with regards to the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| and see what they think about how we've done, because it will add value, not devalue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| And I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| And hearing no second, the motion dies for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| That's the first time since I've chaired that I've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| And that's why I never make motions when I'm chairing, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| I know you still love me at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| Now the chair will entertain a motion as it relates to the 9-11, 9-L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4798)|
| 1:20:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| We already have one, first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Two opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| And we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| And hopefully you guys will continue to have your discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4822)|
| 1:20:31| Okay, Madam Recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Ten C, an appeal by the Dean Hill Neighborhood Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| at the Metropolitan Planning Commission's approval of a request for extension of office uses in RP1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| RP2 districts to include 400 Cheshire Drive for use as a modeling agency in an RP1 district subject to four conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| property located on the northeast side of Cheshire Drive, southeast side of Crest Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| to be considered with Resolution 11-S approving the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| We have two people who are signed up to speak, one for and one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| Does council want to entertain motions prior to hearing from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| or would you like to hear from the two individuals to comment first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| I'll make a motion first to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| At this juncture, we have signed up for, I believe, is Martia Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Martin Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| That looks like an A down there, Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| I thought it was Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| If you're for Ten C, the appeal, the time is 825.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| Martin Bailey, 7134 Cheshire Drive, Endene Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| And we've got several of our neighbors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| We'd ask that they make a show of hands for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| I will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| This property is at the corner of Crest Hill and Cheshire Drive, Endene Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| And two years ago it was a vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| A developer went before MPC for a use on review to build a triplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| MPC approved a use on review for a triplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| City Council approved our appeal, and the developer built a single family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| The current applicant purchased that house, apparently, to operate a modeling agency in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4937)|
| 1:22:24| and asked MPC to rezone the property to OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| That was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| A request for a use on review to operate the modeling agency was approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4950)|
| 1:22:38| And that's this appeal, which we contend is an overly permissive decision that City Council should reverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4958)|
| 1:22:47| And the reason would be in Article 5 of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| This, the application for the use on review, refers to four employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| and classes of rarely exceeding eight customers, which would mean up to 12 cars that would be required in this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4978)|
| 1:23:13| And there's two parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| There's no real way that enough parking can be put off street to accommodate what the application says would be up to 15 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=4995)|
| 1:23:25| And more to the point, there are deed restrictions for this property that require it to be a single family dwelling house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5005)|
| 1:23:34| not a commercial office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| And this, there has never been commercial development on the south side of Crest Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| And if this is approved, there's nothing to stop the two vacant lots going up the hill from Crest Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| on Cheshire Drive from being a commercial use either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| And we would ask the council to approve our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| No one else being signed up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| At this time, it looks like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| Someone else signed up in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| In favor of the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| I'm in favor of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| I guess I marked the wrong spot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| And I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| I didn't read the appeal exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Are you Mr. Griffin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| I'm Mr. Griffin, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| It is 828.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| My name is Ed Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| I live at 113 Golf Club Road in the Dean Hill community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| I'm a lifelong resident of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| I grew up in Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| I went to Bearden 1 through 12 in the 50s, early 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| And I always thought, boy, if I could live in Dean Hill, I'd really have a nice house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| Well, I made it to Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| And we feel like we've got a good neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| And there's a lot of my neighbors here tonight to say that we don't want this to become a commercial enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5092)|
| 1:25:00| And a lot of elderly neighbors that couldn't come but asked me to be here because they couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5100)|
| 1:25:08| So I'm speaking for them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| You know, I'm never against progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| Progress has been my livelihood all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| If it wasn't for progress, you know, I don't think any of us would be able to prosper and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| But there are times that we need to stop and look at what progress is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5125)|
| 1:25:34| We've got a very nice neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| And when Ms. Hatcher purchased the property, she knew it was residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5136)|
| 1:25:45| And if she was misled by a real estate agent, it seems to me that she has a claim against them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| not a pressure against the residents of Dean Hill to accept her commercial endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5151)|
| 1:26:03| I guess by starting with one house being made commercial that you start what I call commercial creep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5163)|
| 1:26:13| And that's the way you destroy neighborhoods is commercial creep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| You find one corner that you can make a commercial endeavor out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| and the next corner you try to make a commercial endeavor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| Somebody on the other side says, well, you know, if that can be commercial on that side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| why can't it be commercial on this side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| And I think we have too much of a neighborhood to be destroyed by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| And we're surrounded by some likely requests that may come up here in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| some that's already being talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| And I feel like the neighbors have drawn a line in the sand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| and said that commercial development is as close as we want it to Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5211)|
| 1:26:58| And we would like for city council to help us keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| In regards to the sign-up sheet, there is no one signed up who is against the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| However, I see two individuals who have come down front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| And I take it you wish to speak against the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| We do, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| My name is Dan Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| I'm an attorney here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| I represent Ms. Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| I thought she had signed up, and I think she thought I had signed up, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| It is 831.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Give us your name, address, and you have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| My name is Dan Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| My address is 5508 Walwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| I represent Ms. Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| One of the objections that was made by the neighborhood was the parking situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| Ms. Hatcher has given great thought to parking for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| There is parking, first of all, across the street in the Testerman, the office complex across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| which she has talked to them about entering into a lease to use that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| She has also drawn out some diagrams about putting in six or eight parking spaces on either Chester Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5282)|
| 1:28:11| or Crestview Drive, depending on what the committee wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| She has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| She did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| She, of course, didn't pave the area or put in parking before until the zoning gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| But the modeling school has, you know, two to four employees usually working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5306)|
| 1:28:36| The main day for customers or students is Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| Not all students drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| They have very young students, so there won't be a car for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| A lot of parents just drop off their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| Another objection they had was that the modeling school, the modeling agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| was not listed as one of the approved commercial establishments in the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| But the ordinance, and all I've got here is I don't have the top of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| just Section C, uses permitted on review, commercial and office uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| commercial establishments as set forth in Article 4, Section 12, Subsection B1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| which is the long list of different businesses, which doesn't include modeling agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| But then it says and business and professional offices subject to the following conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| So I think that the council is certainly not limited to just the list that's provided in Subsection B1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| There is also, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5380)|
| 1:29:50| there's room for six or eight parking spaces on either Chester Drive or Crestview Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| plus two spaces in the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| So we think that that certainly will take care of the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| And Ms. Hatcher is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| She may want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| And there was also one other, Ms. Ashley Bean from the Chamber of Commerce wanted to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| The time is 834.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| Jamie Hatcher, 1009 Misty Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| Excuse me, I'm nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| This did start out with me being misled by a real estate agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| I am responsible for my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| I'm not asking pity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| But when I went in this neighborhood, it wasn't to cause a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| And as soon as I found out that it's a place that I would not be welcome, I put it back on the market to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| But my financial future really rides on this home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| And I wanted to put my business in a home-based atmosphere because we empower young women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| I wanted it to be a comfortable place and a comfortable setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| The house is not in the middle of a subdivision, and I don't feel like traffic patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| nor did the MPC feel that traffic patterns would be impeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| I did not have commercial rezoning, so I don't think that I set any kind of precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| I've always, all along the way, said, is there any way that we can make this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| And I have compromised myself down to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| If I need to work with two employees, I will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| I said I would run a home-based business if that is what I need to do to make it work in this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| I am now a homeowner in this subdivision in Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| I'm proud of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| I am not there to be a detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| I am there to help young girls and make my business successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| And I'm just willing to work in any way that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| And when I'm willing to compromise, they stopped at the MPC because a big argument was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| commercial would mess up our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| So I said a home-based business so no one else can go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| I can't sell it in a year and someone else open a business there that they're not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| And Testerman, when he built a subdivision, allotted so many acres that could be office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| So I don't think that I'm asking for something here that's unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| And I really think that, given a chance, I could be a positive addition to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| I don't want to come in and pave the whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| I don't want it to look like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| There's not going to be a big neon sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| I want it to be a home that welcomes young ladies to neighborhood and to etiquette school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| All through the week, the main thing we do is we're booking them jobs and we're talking to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| Saturday is the only day that I would have people in the house, a large crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| I have more people at my dinner parties than I have in my classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| I would be more of a detriment as a resident, I feel, than I will be as a business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| And I'm just asking for you to consider all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| I really don't think that this is setting a bad precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| And I think that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| Did you indicate there was one other person that wished to speak against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| One note for those that were in favor, since there were three folks who spoke against, we always try to keep parity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| So if you have a time for rebuttal, and I would also, if you will ask, give you a little additional time in your rebuttal if you so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5589)|
| 1:33:16| Please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| And the time is 837.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| My name is Ashley Bean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| I live at 848 Vista Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| The reason why I came up and told Jamie that I was willing to speak tonight, I work for the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| which Barbizon has been a member and good standing of since 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| But also, too, I started out as a student at Barbizon when I was 12 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| I ended up working for the company and was employed by Jamie before I worked for or started working for the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| And what I wanted to say was that during the week, it's a very small amount of people that are at the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| There's usually around four of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| On the weekends would be the main time on Saturday in the afternoon when there are a group of girls there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| But I do believe that the company itself is a great institution and that it did have an effect on my personal growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5646)|
| 1:34:15| So I just wanted to say that I wouldn't look at it as a disturbance in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| It's the majority of people in the classes are under the age of 16 and would be young girls that would be dropped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5659)|
| 1:34:27| So I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| Mr. Bailey, you have a rebuttal time of two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| If you need a few extra, just ask for a motion from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| It's now 8.38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| I want to clear up two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| First, Ms. Hatcher referred to a home-based business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| I want to make clear that this is not a situation where the applicant is asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5685)|
| 1:34:52| or has received permission on a use-on-review to have a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| This is to use this home and convert it to a commercial office structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| This is not an application where this is a residential home that somebody lives in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| and operates a business out of it on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| This is a use-on-review that allows the conversion of this property to commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| The applicant stated that there was no intention to pave the lot over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| In fact, on the application that was submitted to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| it shows on the house here the garage, two existing spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| and then all the way up the hill to the property line it says paved parking area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| five added spaces equals seven total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| That really is paving over the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| And the worst part about that is the only way I can see that these parking lots get put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5744)|
| 1:35:52| is if you pull off Cheshire Drive perpendicular into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| So if you're coming down Cheshire Drive, you would see seven parking lots in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| each one of these cars which would have to back out onto Cheshire Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| which is coming down the hill on Cheshire Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| And I can't imagine the safety problems that that would cause because nobody could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| if there were cars all parked in a row, you couldn't see through the cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| especially with these SUVs, to see who's coming down the hill on Cheshire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| which is the road that was closed during the traffic study about three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| So we think that this commercial use to pave the lot over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| and to convert the home into a commercial use is not compatible with our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| And we'd ask that our appeal be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Actually, I believe Councilman Frost was ahead of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| You were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Jamie and I met some months ago when this issue first came before anyone, before it came before NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5813)|
| 1:37:02| And she was kind enough to be in touch with me and to talk to me about what she had hoped to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| Unfortunately, at that point, she had already purchased the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| and was the owner of this residential piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| So I certainly agree with you that Barbizon is a wonderful opportunity for young ladies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| to improve their status and their manners and other things that Jamie and I discussed to be a plus about the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| that she's operating and the manner in which she is hoping to influence young women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| And I certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| At the time, my granddaughter was a student in her program, and actually she was 17 at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5861)|
| 1:37:50| And she was driving herself to her studies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| So I appreciate Jamie having been a wonderful neighbor to the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| and operating Barbizon there on Bearden Hill in a very successful manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| And I really applaud her for her success there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| I suggested to her that she was in a very difficult position because of the property, which has been before us before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5891)|
| 1:38:20| and just recommended that if there was any possibility of her being successful in this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5900)|
| 1:38:28| where she finds herself the owner of that property, she needed to go before the Dean Hill Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5908)|
| 1:38:36| and meet with them and discuss what she had in mind and receive their approval in order to receive my endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5916)|
| 1:38:46| So she did that, and she's been very forthright with her situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| It does not change, however, the very difficult situation it puts the neighborhood in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| that it puts council in as in terms of what this means to the future of that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5939)|
| 1:39:06| and properties that are immediately adjacent and other properties that are going to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| So I just want to thank her, though, publicly for the way that she has approached this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| for the manner in which she has understood the challenge that she had before her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5957)|
| 1:39:24| And it's a regrettable situation that she finds herself in because, truly, this is going to be a challenge before her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5964)|
| 1:39:33| And I wish you well, Jamie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| Although I cannot support you, of course, in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Mr. Donaldson, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| In the letter to city council from Phoebe Wills, the Ms. Hatcher's real estate agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5985)|
| 1:39:53| it references she has real estate interest at 6711 Kingston Pike, 400 Cheshire Drive, and 1009 Misty Springs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=5993)|
| 1:40:06| And it says Misty Springs Drive is her residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| I thought as part of the use on review process to be granted a use on review for a home occupation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6009)|
| 1:40:16| it had to be a home, your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| We went through that with a situation in Old North Knoxville some five to six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| This wasn't an application as a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| It was an application for a professional office within the RP1 zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| Yeah, I guess, you know, Ms. Hatcher, I think I'm going to have to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| You sort of got a tough position because, to a degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| you know you want to do the right things and are going to try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| And I realize that particular house has some problems for residential use because of its location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6048)|
| 1:40:56| The challenge becomes this creep that was talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| And much as I know I can sit here and fight that kind of creep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| I can't promise the people who live in that neighborhood that we're going to prevent it in the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| We've seen way too many examples of exactly what you say won't happen happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| And it won't be your fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| If you get this, somebody is going to come into that lot behind it or next door and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| try and do the same kind of thing or get a commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| And it does creep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| And we've seen this at so many places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| So, unfortunately, I think that you're sort of caught in something where the system isn't quite working right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| And I have to vote against you because of that because we can't protect the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| And I do support what you're doing but can't support your choice in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Seeing no further likes, I'll call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6110)|

| 1:43:26| I wanted to amend Section 2 to move that $8 million that's going to all those other jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| We couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6211)|

| 1:49:56| And we appreciate him taking the time and the thought that went into it from the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6601)|

| 1:50:15| Well, I just wanted to comment that I have had some calls from neighborhoods that were not included in the original caption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6615)|
| 1:50:23| and information about this and wanted to know why they weren't included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| So I think there are going to be other areas that are going to be ringing your bells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| and asking you to allow them to also consider the possibility of being a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6633)|

| 1:50:45| Mr. Vice Mayor, I'm really glad to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| I think it's a bona fide, legitimate process and device and vehicle that these neighborhoods can go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6647)|
| 1:50:55| where everybody will have an opportunity to participate and that we will get the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| the sufficient protection that our neighborhoods need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| So, and I'm really glad because I think some of the other vehicles that were there for them was more divisive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6665)|
| 1:51:13| and created friction among neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| So I'm really glad to get that out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6675)|

| 1:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Mr. Johnson, I have a quick question on a possible amendment which I think is minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| In Section 12-1, it's the finding of facts section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| Section 3 there sort of talks about the causes of flood losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| And everything it talks about is sort of what we do in the flood plain directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| And what's not addressed there is the upstream development, all the stuff that's not happening right in the flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6777)|
| 1:53:04| And to my mind, we know from what's happening in much of my district where flooding happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6784)|
| 1:53:11| the causes are not what the people right there are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| It's the causes of things way upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| And I guess this is just to ask, and this is a first reading, whether the department would be willing to amend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| to include some of that language that says it's not just, you know, something in the flood plain that causes floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| The flood losses are significantly higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| So just to see if that's something you all could consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| We'd be willing to consider it, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| But I'd prefer that that type language be in the stormwater ordinance, the 22.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6818)|
| 1:53:44| This is the model ordinance that FEMA asked us to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| This is the direct FEMA language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| If we change that significantly, they may not approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| And in the interest of time, I'll talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| We didn't get a chance to talk today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=6838)|

| 1:58:28| And what it is, we've had the city put in some striping along the shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7108)|
| 1:58:34| This would be the northeast corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| And you might notice a barrel placed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| Our crossing guard every day has to put the barrel there to keep knuckleheads, like the one here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| from driving over the white lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| We'd like the city to put up some kind of a system of curbing or some kind of poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| something similar across the street from Bearden High School on Kingston Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| If we could do that, that would be great, or some kind of curbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| And I'm just scared to death when the children come down off the sidewalk and adults, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| These cars are going to be right on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| And like I say, we've got some knuckleheads that are just not going to pay any attention to those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7152)|
| 1:59:20| Also, on Hollywood Drive, we're starting to have cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| Now, this probably can't see that from here, but I want to have appropriate pictures to all the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| and everything, nice color prints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7168)|

| 1:59:41| We request that the city put up no parking on shoulder signs from Kelly Place on to the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7181)|
| 1:59:48| Also, they have just torn up the beautiful sloping line as it comes down toward the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| And the effect left over is just terrible, lots churned up and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| If we could do that, if we could have the police, until that happens, keep an eye on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| I don't think there's any ordinance that prohibits that now, but we can certainly use that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| I think there's a similar situation on Paper Mill on those interstate bridges near Liberty Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| There are like four signs on each side of the street, no parking on shoulder, and it was a tow-away zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| We definitely could use something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| A couple of other real quick items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| I congratulate the mayor on having the position on neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| One thing that I think could really help and save the city taxpayers money in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| since the Center for Neighborhood Development no longer exists, they served as our physical sponsor as well as other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7231)|
| 2:00:38| There are a lot of funds that we've received in the past from various foundations where we wouldn't have to come here begging for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| If the city or some department could serve as physical sponsor for us, there's a lot of things we could do on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7245)|
| 2:00:52| In particular, the pond property, I was in contact with a foundation a couple of years ago that could have got us some funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7252)|
| 2:01:01| had we had a physical sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| The only other drawback to that was, because we did have a physical sponsor at the time, was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| if the property had been 50 acres instead of five, we thought we could get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| But there are other foundations around the country that if we did have a physical sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| because we're just not set up to apply for a 5013C status, so in your deliberations for the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7276)|
| 2:01:23| if you could maybe do something like that, if the city is able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| That's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| Any comments or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| Like I said, I'll provide everyone with copies of all the photographs here so you can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7289)|
| 2:01:34| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| And we'll make sure we provide not only to the council but to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| Seeing no further likes, no witnesses for public forum, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070327?start=7301)|
