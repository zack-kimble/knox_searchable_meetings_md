| 0:04:07| It's great to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| I have been doing this presentation with finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| prior to this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| So it underscored to me several points about the KBT budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| First is a reminder when you know the work of our police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| and fire departments is fundamentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| a core function of city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Providing services to urban core is one of the main reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| the city budget as a whole over the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| And as with the city as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| the majority of the police budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| supports our people's salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| The next largest portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| is supporting internal service charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| It was interesting to me to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| that a relatively small percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| goes towards things like equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| So I look forward to hearing all the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| that you enjoy and learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| and questions you have about this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| And Chief Thomas and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| along with Chief Financial Officer, Susan Janot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| welcome this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| And thank you, Council, for your due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| on important matters in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| I'm gonna now turn it over to Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| to lead the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Chief Thomas, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=306)|
| 0:05:06| And City Council as well, all council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| I really appreciate this opportunity that you provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| for us to showcase our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| and how that money is spent that you allocate each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| I know that you've had questions over the past workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| that have delved into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| And so we finally get this opportunity now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| And it's a good presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| And I hope that you will ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| to clarify anything that you're not comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| You know, we look forward to, as the mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| you know, we really, this is a huge opportunity for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| re-imagining policing and looking into new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| and innovative ways that we can use the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| that were allocated and how can we change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| you know, policing so that we can do law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| in a much better, more effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| So this is pretty exciting for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| And like I said, this is a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| for us to share with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| and find out what you're thinking as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| So with that, my comments are a whole lot shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| I'd like to turn it over to Susan Juneau, our CFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| She has put together a great presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=371)|

| 0:06:26| And we appreciate very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| the indulgence of council on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| Before I start, I want to give a huge shout out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| of course, to the police department for their help on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| but a huge shout out to my staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| I counted up and I think we've got maybe about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| a combined 100 years worth of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| that have worked on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=410)|

| 0:07:37| but we will start out broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| and kind of drill down as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| And next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| So as the Mayor mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| the KPD budget makes up 17% of our total net budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| The net budget is 349 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| Police again is almost 59 million of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| and the fire department makes up about 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| So total 29% for public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| And the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| And this is an overview of the city general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| with public safety of the general fund being 43%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=500)|
| 0:08:30| You can see the various areas there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| police at a quarter of the pie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| fire another 18%, transfers also at 18%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| general government at 9%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| and you can see where the other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| kind of fall out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| So transfers, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| transfers would involve things like general fund supplements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| for stormwater and solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| and we can get into more of that later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| if you've got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| But anyway, there's a good overview of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| Next slide, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| So again, public safety is 43% of the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| and in total dollars, that's a little over $100 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| police being 58.1 million of that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=558)|
| 0:09:26| Next slide, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| The general fund again, $58.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| And then in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| and that's 98.6% of the total KPD budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| So additionally, they've got some special revenue funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| some grant funding, and some capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| and we'll kind of delve deeper into those as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| But the bulk of their funding is in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| Mr. Noe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Just for those watching at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| and as a refresher for us all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| can you explain the difference between the net budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| and the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Sure, the net budget is the total budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Councilman Smith, that council has adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| And that means all of the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| less what we term in accounting as internal service funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| so that nothing is duplicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| And we'll talk more about internal service funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| as we get a little bit deeper into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| Of course, the general fund is the main operating fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| But yes, the entire budget is a total of 349 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=636)|
| 0:10:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| So to give you an idea of some benchmarking data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| that I think has been provided through MTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| total police costs per capita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| And you can see where Knoxville falls in that analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| against some of our other peer cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| Pretty much middle of the pack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| KPD also, as you're aware, generates some income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| And that's made up of everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| from a little bit of money in sessions fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| and traffic school, all the way to city court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| And you can see all those different categories there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| So they bring in a little over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| three and a quarter million dollars of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| And I think I forgot to mention at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| all of these numbers are based on adopted FY21 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| And I apologize that I didn't point that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| in the beginning, but this is adopted 21 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| So our general fund overview specific to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| As you can see from this pie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| the bulk of their expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| are in our personal services area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| which of course is personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| And that's followed pretty closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| by internal service charges, other, and supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| And we'll dig deeper there here in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Again, their total in the general fund is $58.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| The bulk of it, and the key takeaway from this slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| is that they are a public service entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| The bulk of that is on our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| And of course, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Can we go back to the last slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Out of the police budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| are these items that generate money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| is the police budget paying for them to operate, exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| Is that under the umbrella of the police budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| So in some cases, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| For instance, you'll see Safety City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Yes, we do have expenditures associated with Safety City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| and we'll dig deeper into that in a coming slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| Some of these, of course, are their fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| and litigation tax, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| that they garner by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| based on the patrol work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| So say like from city court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| from the police budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| is there money going in to city court to keep it running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| So let me, Ms. Singh, very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| and Ms. Juneau, you may be able to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| Some of these dollars per state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| have to go back into certain functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| I believe, Ms. Juneau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| that most of these go back into general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| So when the revenue is generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| it comes back into the city's overall coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| Is that correct, Ms. Juneau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Yes, that is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| But there are some things restricted based on state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| I wanna say that court costs or tickets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| actually have a restriction for those dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| have to be used for training later, but-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Yes, citations and litigation tax, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| Did that answer your question, Ms. Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Right, the revenue that's generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| does not all of it becomes part of the police budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Pretty much all goes in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Cool, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Just one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Just to be 100% clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| the 3.28 million is all part of the 58.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Councilman Smith, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| We account for revenues separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| So it's not 58.1 million net of 3.28 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| The revenues go into the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| and then their appropriations are 58.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| But I think it is worthy of noting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| that there are specific revenue streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| associated with the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| come directly into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| A portion of the 3.28 makes its way into the 58.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| but not all of it, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Well, in effect, the 3.28 is one of many revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| the largest of which would be property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| That all goes to offset any of the appropriations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| that we have in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| A little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Should we think of 3.28 as a subset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| as a component, as a part of 58.1 or totally separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| Personally, I would look at it separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| It's all a part of KPD's budget, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| but the 3.28 is on the revenue side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| and the 58.1 million is on the appropriation side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| Thank you, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Yes, Councilwoman Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Just following up a little on what Councilman Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Really, revenue comes in from lots of different sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| KPD generates 3 point whatever million of total revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| that goes to the city based on those buckets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| that you just showed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Out of all that money that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| 58 point million of it is given to KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| to cover expenditures for the police department, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| In effect, this 3.28 eventually, in theory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| offsets the 58.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1058)|
| 0:17:38| Right, so their net cost to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| would be about 55 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| If you look at and generate 3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| because of 58, that would really cost us 55 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| from other revenue sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| But that wasn't my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| My other question back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| if you'll go to the slide that you have before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| about the percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| personnel services of 73%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| is that pretty much in line with all other departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| in the city that personnel costs are about 73%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| I mean, in many organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| personnel costs are 85 to 90% of a department's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| So I'm just kind of curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| and you may not be able to answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| but 73% for personnel is not extravagant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| compared to what I've seen in other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| in terms of headcount, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| Yes, thank you for that comment, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| I am going to defer to someone else on the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| rather than take a stab at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| If there's someone on my staff that might could answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| Councilor, Councilwoman Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| we can get all of those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| but in general, anywhere from 70 to 76%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| we'll have to get those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| is where that number often falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| I guess your point is very, is valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| Organizations that don't have heavy capital items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| like a lot of vehicles and radios and equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| would oftentimes see a higher human resource cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| compared to what we see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| So that's a really good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| We can draw that number for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| for public service engineering, if you'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| No, I am not asking you for a specific dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| I don't expect anybody to be able to give that to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| and it's probably not worth your time to research it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| I was just trying to ask generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| that we don't have a ton of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| it's not like 90% of our budget is in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| In keeping with or less than most city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| in terms of people cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| That was kind of the point or question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| I was trying to get confirmation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| So I think you answered that, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| I would say it's in keeping with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| but we'll confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| I will note, but Boyce is telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| he thinks it's around 65 to 70% in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| So definitely in the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| Councilwoman, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| Okay, so I think maybe we're ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| to advance to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Here you can see for the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| KPD's historical trend since FY15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| And over the last 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| KPD's general fund has grown at an average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| of about two and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| compared to the city's total general fund growth rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| of about 3.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| You can see there was an outlier there in FY18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| We changed, made a change due to an allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| of how the pension liability is accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| But other than that, the trend has certainly been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| that KPD has lagged behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| the overall general fund growth rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| Okay, so back to personal services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| And to break that down just a little bit further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| of that 73% that we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| salaries and wages account for 28.7 million or 68%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| And benefits make up the other 13.6 million or 32%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| The staffing, and we do as a best practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| we budget for full staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| and that includes 416 uniformed officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| 101 civilian employees for a total force of 517 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1332)|
| 0:22:20| And I believe the chief could tell us better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| but I believe I keep hearing that they're about 85% staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| with sworn officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| That's correct, we have 370 as of today, sworn officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| So another benchmarking survey from MTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| the police full-time equivalence per 1,000 in population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| Again, here's how we align with our peer cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| Again, I think we're somewhat at the midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| I believe these surveys are from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| I will make the point there, they go through 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| and that is the latest data that MTAS had available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| So if we dig a little deeper into individual items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1396)|
| 0:23:26| on the budget, supplies make up a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| than $2 million, and oh, yes, I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| Well, I don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| I can see the bottom of the screen now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| I know there's been a little trouble seeing the full page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| the full page, maybe not for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| but I think for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| But supplies make up about $2 million of their total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| and you can see how that's broken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| The bulk of that is 1.1 million for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| That's made up of various items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| There's some money in there for miscellaneous equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| office supplies, and uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| And you can see a list of examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| for what would fall under maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| and what would fall under miscellaneous equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Those are by no means exhaustive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| Can I ask a quick question, Chief Thomas, specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| Do officers not have to buy any of their uniforms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| So, and I can tell you that in 1993, when I came on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| we had a $500 a year clothing allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| that we can buy uniforms with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| That has not changed since 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| To give you an example, I went just two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| and bought three pairs of pants, two long sleeve shirts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| two short sleeve shirts, and it was $432, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| And I sit in an office all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Our folks go through them quite a bit quicker than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| So yes, they pay some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| I'm sure they pay probably double out of pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| And that includes flashlights, boots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| things like that that we can buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| So the $500 is all equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| What about like a belt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Yes, all of that is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Okay, so when you went and spent 400 and something dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| you only covered your pants and your shirts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| You didn't cover your boots, your flashlight, your belt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| any of those other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Those are out-of-pocket expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| They are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Initially, they are provided to the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| That's part of the cost of hiring a new officer in training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| They're provided to the new officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| but those leather belts will wear out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Mine wear out in about two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| So about every two to three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| they have to replace some of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| The reason I asked is when the logo pieces got redesigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| that went on the uniforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| an officer commented to me about having to buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| I guess they had to pay to have those sewn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| to their uniforms, or they had to buy new clothes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| They did not have to buy new clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| The uniform shops changed them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| I think for $2 per patch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| And you could use your clothing allowance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| So you could use your existing uniforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| and they would take off the old patch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| and put on the new patch for $2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Okay, thank you for the clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| It was several years ago that we changed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| but that did happen, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| It's been in the last, maybe six years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Definitely in the last 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Oh, yes, yes, yes, not too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| It was during Chief Roush's tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Yeah, and I think uniform allocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| are something that we've tried to look at holistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| and KPD is behind in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| It's been 500 a really long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| but if you'll remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| we've tried to increase equipment allocations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| tool allotment and fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| We've tried to address it in public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| because the equipment, clothing is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| So I just reiterate that the Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| has brought this up and it is definitely something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| we need to look at in a future budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| So this is Gwen, let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| So when an officer graduates and they're sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| what are they provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| What equipment, uniform, what is provided to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| that they don't have to pay for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Everything is provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| but that clothing allows that $500 for that year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| that they're in is used to contribute towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| So when they graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| they may have two short sleeve shirts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| and two long sleeve shirts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| If they want to have any more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| two pairs of pants, they need to buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| They either wait till the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| or they can buy them out of pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Now, we also, when we have officers leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| they will turn in their uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| If those uniforms are in fairly good shape, we keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| And we let our newest officers or anybody who needs one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| come and see if they'll have one that will fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| I know, you know, in the women's locker room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| as I have unfortunately gained a little bit of weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| I had some shirts that I were fairly new and put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| and said, if you need these, please take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| So, you know, we do pass some things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| That was an unofficial way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| Normally it would go to another department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| our supply department, our supply officer keeps those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| So if you needed uniforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| and you had no more clothing allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| there may be some available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Now, jackets, you know, jackets are about three, $400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| We don't see too many of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| They get worn pretty quickly, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| And so the new officers are provided a jacket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| and boots as well at no cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| A light jacket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| Okay, are we ready for the next slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| So our internal service charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| make up a little over $8.2 million of the adopted budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| And that's made up of three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| The equipment replacement category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| the bulk of course is fleet charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| and then risk management charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| And those would be items that in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| KPD doesn't have a whole lot of say so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| for lack of a better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| Those things are pretty well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Of course, the fleet charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| are really the vehicle replacement fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| the equipment replacement or smaller items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| that would be considered capital type items, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| that may last four or five years or longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| and anticipated to be continued to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| and then risk management, that's your general liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| property and workers' comp type charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| So they can have some impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| on the risk management to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| but it's somewhat hard to impact this 8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1806)|
| 0:30:15| Okay, and then we've got other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| And that makes up about $5.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| and you can see the breakout there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| The bulk of that is space rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| followed by grants and benevolences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| professional service charges, utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| miscellaneous operating costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| and a very small amount for travel and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| because they do a lot of train the trainer type work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| to keep that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| And you can see, again, this is not an exhaustive list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| but you can see examples there to the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| of items that would be charged to each of those buckets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1855)|
| 0:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Mr. Jeneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Under grants and benevolences to other entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| I see reference, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| miscellaneous professional fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| I see reference to the BHUC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| I believe as part of the previous year budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| we appropriated 600 and something thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Does that ring a bell to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| Maybe Mr. Brace, if you were part of that for Mr. Jeneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| I believe that's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I think it was 625, I could be a little off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Yeah, I would have to look at it, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| All right, so that's in the professional services bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| Okay, so KPD, and I think the key takeaway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| from this slide is we budget, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| in the general fund, the city's match for all the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| And again, this is based on the original adopted budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| So anything that you've approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| since that point is not included here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| But for this current year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| the FY21 adopted budget includes a $105,000 match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| for grants, and you can see how that's broken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| But the key takeaway is over the life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| the life of all the grants that we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| have outstanding in KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| which is a little bit shy of $6 million total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| the city has only had to invest $302,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| So only 5.1% of the total grant funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| which is pretty good return on our dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| Yes, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Should we think of this as a separate revenue stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| as well, similar to the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| At least the grants from external sources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Yes, those grants, the non-matching funds, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| So the grant funds down there, the $5,571,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| that's not running directly through the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| But yes, that is another revenue stream, absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| that offsets the cost that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| for KPD, absolutely, yes, that's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2015)|
| 0:33:47| Okay, next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| So this breaks down our special revenue funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| and I think I mentioned Safety City earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| in response to one of our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| You can see here we have total special revenue funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| of 1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| We've got the federal drug funds there of 957,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| in addition to what we're gonna call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| the other special revenue funds of 363,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| that we referenced earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| And you can see examples also of drug fund expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| Those are based on law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| The law prescribes what we can actually spend on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| out of those funds once those seizures become forfeitures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| And then as far as the other special revenue funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| you can see the breakdown on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| We've got Safety City, Traffic Safety, Collision Avoidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| Sex Offender Registry, a small amount for donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| Training and Seizure Funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2086)|
| 0:34:54| And then here's a capital overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| This is the capital that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| in the FY21 budget only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| and we'll give you a slide here in just a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| on the lifetime capital, what's currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| And so the capital consisted of $258,000 in police equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| and you can see a listing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| training room improvements and undercover vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| that a total of a little over $386,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| And this slide shows you the previous capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| that is still in place that we are working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| And when you see those expenditures life-to-date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| that is actually through October 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I meant to get an updated amount today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| and I have failed to do that, I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| but that is through October 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| And we've already made it to questions and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2153)|
| 0:36:04| So is there anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| I know we've had several questions as we go along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| but is there anything that I can help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| or that someone on my team might could help us with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Ms. Juneau, I'll throw out a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| So we had a slide where you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| and this may not be from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| but the KPD benchmarking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| so police FTE per 1,000 population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Information from MTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| This may not be an MTAS question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| but I'm curious what the expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| and budgeting look like for those cities as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| not just FTE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| We don't have that, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Oh, okay, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| We do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| But further up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| It's cost per capita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2222)|
| 0:37:02| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2222)|
| 0:37:14| Question for me, for Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| I think council has provided a different report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| that showed the number of total police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| total number of employees in the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| I think it's remained the same number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| for the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Is that 517?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| Oh, I can tell you for sure that sworn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| has remained at 416 since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| Our civilian employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| I think have been somewhere between 100 and 110| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| during those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| So yes, pretty much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2273)|
| 0:38:01| Hi, this is Gwen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Quick question or just point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| So the body cameras, where are they falling on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| Is that in contracts equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Because I didn't, if you called them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| I didn't, I'm sorry, I didn't hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| And I may have actually skipped over that, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| If we could go to slide 17, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| This is gonna sound really weird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| but it's in that space rent category there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| that $2.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| And because that includes equipment leases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| and those body cams fall into the category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| of equipment leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| This is Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| So yes, Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| you said that we've been at 416 sworn officers since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| So for 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| we've had the same sworn officer component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Can you tell me, or can anyone tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| what the population of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| was in 2004 and what it is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| I can give you a very rough estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| I can go back and look for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| but I'm thinking it was around 176| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| and now it's somewhere around 189, 191.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| That's generally where it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| Okay, so population has grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| but sworn officers has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2380)|
| 0:39:40| Well, and not yet, not that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| In that the allocated sworn officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| have not been increased since 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| but the population of the city has grown since 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| and we are not even fully staffed with sworn officers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2403)|
| 0:40:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2412)|
| 0:40:25| Council, do we have any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| I do, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Just for reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| when we look at the cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| and I don't expect anybody to find this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| but when we look at what people are spending per capita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| the cities that are spending per capita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| So that's by county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| Is Franklin County or Franklin the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| I mean, it's Franklin, the suburb outside of Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Yes, Franklin is where I am right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| They're in Williamson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| It's its own municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I'm just looking because I would be curious at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| to know how is this adjusted for cost of living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2480)|
| 0:41:30| Because I would think it costs more to live in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| than it does in Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| I'm just wondering when we look at pure cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| not anything we're spending a ton of time on, just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| Ma'am, this is Erin Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| I will check in with MTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| and see if they can provide clarity on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| I don't know off the top of my head what the case is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| Ms. Fugett, I did happen to just check the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| has grown just a little bit as Chief Thomas said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| It was 173.9,000, 100,000, and 2,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| and now it's around 190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| We'll find out more in 2020, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| It has grown not exponentially, but a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| and our police numbers have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Ms. Juneau, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| On this page, the KPD benchmarking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| all of these towns and cities are around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Do we have anything from other states around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| or other cities around the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| I personally have not looked at that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| I'm not sure if the chief or someone else may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| So I have tried to do that a little bit, Councilwoman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| and I don't have some good hard data yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| because it's very hard to compare apples to apples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| but I'm actually trying to do that with mid-city agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| involved in the International Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| of Chiefs of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| So if I can come up with a good graph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| which is what I'm working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| I'll be glad to get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Okay, what would be useful is to check the cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| where they have changed a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| of how they're doing policing model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| like Eugene, Oregon, or someplace like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| to see when they've made the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| what happens to per capita costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Yeah, that wouldn't be a city I would normally check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| just because it's not a size of ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| but we can make a size similar to ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| You know, that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| we could try and do that at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| I don't know if anybody's working on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Okay, it's just a way to start looking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| when people really, when cities choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| a very different model, what happens to those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| Ms. Chenote, this is Gwen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Do you mind if we were just to kind of go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| the attached items, the addendum items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Not necessarily in total detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| but just for those who may be watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Have an opportunity to kind of see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| all the information that council has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| if you could just maybe high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| You're referencing the extra reference slides, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2675)|
| 0:44:35| Okay, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| So, and we've kind of, I think already alluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| to this particular slide in some of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| that have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| but to the point that the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| has increased significantly, but the force has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| This slide from the time period FY99 to FY04| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| kind of shows that trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| And I've understood, I believe from some of my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| that where the uniform strength was increased there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| for a few years, that had to do with some grant funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Let me, a quick question for Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| So, Chief Thomas, you know, as there are conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| in the city, with the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| about the possibility of having the baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| back in our inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| do you envision that we would need to change our numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| as it relates to public safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Because we would have a venue such as that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| that would bring more people potentially into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| for events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Just, I mean, I know you probably don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| I don't know if you've given that a lot of thought or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| but just maybe guesstimate if you feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| we would need to look at more numbers because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| Well, in my gut feeling, my wish would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| I think that would be considered a special event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| similar to UT football, where we would have the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| to have more officers on hand during those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| And of course, there may be more events there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| than just baseball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| You know, there may be concerts or other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| So, you know, we'd have to have more officers to pull from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| to be able to do that on a continual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| But I guess it's kind of a yes, yes answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| Okay, we can advance to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| So this is a general fund overview by unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| Again, this is only the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| It's based on the adopted budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| It's the $58.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| And you can see how that breaks down with operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| which would of course be patrol being the largest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| the largest unit, or cost center maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| is the way I would think of it, of their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2817)|
| 0:47:06| Okay, next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Here is a detail of all of the current grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| And Cheryl Davis, of course, is our grant expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| She does a wonderful job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| of keeping those accounted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| and working with our KPD counterpart in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| And it's kind of small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| I know it's hard to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| but this details that a little over $5.8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| in total funds that we've been able to leverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| for only $302,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| So that's pretty incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| Again, here's the FY21 operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| for the general fund broken down a little bit further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| for you into all of our different categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| that we've discussed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| personal services, supplies, and other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| and again, by unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| Okay, and then here's KPD's percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2894)|
| 0:48:31| of the general fund over the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| And as you can see, over the last 10 fiscal years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| their percentage of the total city general fund has dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| and that is depicted with that red trend line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| Ms. Juneau, I'm not sure who can answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| someone who has some history, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| The reasons behind some of these drops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| and especially, can't tell the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| but where it drops extremely, the lowest point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| Does anyone know why those decisions were made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| Ms. Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| Is that the one where we changed the pension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Yeah, there's a slide somewhere that denotes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| that was the pension change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| I'm trying to look back and see, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| I do think that's exactly right, it's that pension change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| but I'm trying to look back to see what page that's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| Page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| Okay, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| And then also, as the budget was decreasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| where were the cuts made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| Why was the budget decreased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Why were the costs less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Council Member Singh, I think it was just the percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| of the KPD's budget became a shrinking share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| of the general fund, but it didn't decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I think it just became a smaller share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| I see. Right, Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Yeah, they had smaller increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| compared to other areas of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| And I think it's a very telling, the slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| if you'll go back, Ms. Juneau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| to the one that shows the red dotted trend line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| That is a telling-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| 28, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| It's a fairly telling graph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| that shows that over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| we have not been drastically increasing KPD's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| They have fallen short over the last decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| It's not been going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| It's been, as a percentage, it's been decreasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| and we've been really just barely holding our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| to cover personnel costs, the two and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| a few increases insurance, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| And I think the total headcount in KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| obviously reflects that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| We've been a growing city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Interests in urban spaces throughout the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| have seen this type of investment and growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| but we haven't necessarily grown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| our law enforcement public safety capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| My guess is we would need to do this for fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| but I think fires had very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| It's not like we're out building 15 or 20 new stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| and adding personnel and fire either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| So what I would call bread and butter-based services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| of local government have stayed very flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| for the last decade, even though the city has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| But I think the next slide will show that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| even in a different way, Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Yes, exactly as the mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| this is pretty much the same information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| shown in a little bit different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| But again, the message being that over the last 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| KPD's average growth in the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| has only been about two and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| compared to 3.7% overall in the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| And KPD is referenced there in the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3134)|
| 0:52:27| And I believe that's our last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| I don't know if there's more questions or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| I can only see one person at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| So please feel free to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| This is Janet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Oh, hi, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| So when we're talking about budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| and obviously we budget for being fully staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| you know, we're currently 46 officers down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| So is that contributing to the decline in budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| So if we were fully staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| would we anticipate ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| that that budget would increase for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Well, the chief may wanna speak to this, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| But I think what's happening is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| they have had a lot of officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| who are now in a position of working a lot of overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| And that has taken a lot of the bulk of their expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3206)|
| 0:53:35| Again, she might want to elaborate more on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| but I think that's a lot of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| That's exactly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| And the overtime is using up those vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| that funding on those vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| You know, we pay an officer time and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| but that is not sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| I've got to get some more officers in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| simply because my officers are getting tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| They're gonna start making bad decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| They're gonna start having crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| and I can't have them dependent on that extra income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| because it will go away as we increase our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And that's what we're working so hard on recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| And you all allocated that money for recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| And I think that is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| We are getting, even in this climate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| we are getting some very good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| So I do appreciate the money that you all allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| a year ago for recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| That has really helped us tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| So Council Member Testament, just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| like we budget and you all approve a budget for 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| So if we ever do reach that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| we won't be at any deficit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| That's what's already budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| And I know we, yes, I know we don't account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| for any dark time as we pass the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| But I just didn't know if we were fully staffed consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| and then at what point as the city is growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| would we start to anticipate potentially growing the force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| but it also requires more equipment, more fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| more all of those things, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| Right, and as far as overtime, just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| we do have an overtime budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| even when we are fully staffed for a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| We realize that some cases we'll go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| So just to make that clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| there is a little bit of an overtime budget in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| It's pretty substantial though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Is it not like 8 million or something for overtime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| Or I don't know where I'm getting that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| or I remember looking at that previously, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| Not being in my office, I can't tell you, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| Thinking if we were completely full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| you know, how that potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Deputy Chief Miller, did you have that handy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Yeah, let me just pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| I think it was around 1.8 million is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Okay, there was an eight in there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| I know that sounded high, I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| You would see if KPD was fully staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| what you would see is there wouldn't be a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| at the end of the year to transfer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| for unfilled positions to cover overages in overtime, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| I mean, the reality is the service is the service, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| But you either cover it with full staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| or if you're not full staff, you cover it with overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| So it just would prevent the end of year transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| Right, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| But it would be much better on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| obviously the officers themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| if we were fully staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| There's the emotional and the intangibles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| not related to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| when we don't have adequate staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| And I'll just reiterate Chief Thomas's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| about how important it is that we're moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| with these recruitment and marketing efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Because even as we are doing better on that front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| we also have a ton of officers eligible for retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| who could retire tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| So we need to recruit new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| just to maintain our current forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| and also to eventually hopefully get up to 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| But we got our work cut out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| So of the 370 I have now, just to give you a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| I have 61 that could retire with full retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| They have their time and age today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| So that is a huge concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| So the slide about the number of approved officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| that goes from 1998-99 to 2003-2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| number one, why does it only reflect those years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| Why only to 2003-2004?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| So that's when it hasn't changed since 2003-2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| Okay, so let me start with that last column then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| So the general fund has been covering 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| Are we still getting five grant funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| So if you look, there's three lines here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| there's uniform strength, which is the total number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| general fund funded 416,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| and then grant funded of five in 2003-2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| Do we know our uniform strength is 421 to this day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| that we're budgeted for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| No, it's 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| It's 416, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| So look at the general fund number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| for what our current number is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| So I guess my question is all those different years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| like 98-99 and up to 2003-2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| I'm curious what grants covered those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| I see the big jump in uniformed numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| doesn't necessarily correspond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| to the number that are grant funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Like in 98-99, we were at 416| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| and 49 of them were grant funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| 2000-2001, and I guess 2001-2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| it's 30 grant funded and the number jumps up to 446.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| What we know happened that year was 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| I'm just trying to figure out like what were the grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| Like what correlates to those grant numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| So, and I'm gonna take a stab at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| I was not in a position back then to know all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| I was in personnel for a couple of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| Those were COPS grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| That was during the years that we tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| to get more officers on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| And so there were grants, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| to cover the first three years of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| And then the agency had to cover salaries beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| And I think Chief Keith had applied for and received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| And then when we did a budget cuts after 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| those grant funded, we just didn't fulfill those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| They weren't, we kept the grant funded positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| We cut the other positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| so that we didn't lose the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3598)|
| 0:59:58| we fulfilled the contract, but we cut other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| Right, well, my guess is as people retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| you just didn't fill spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| That, and yes, and we cut off hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| We didn't hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Right, you didn't have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| we don't have enough money for our officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| time to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| I mean, that's not really ever been a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| or a position we've been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| No, no, we have never laid off officers, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| No, we have never done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| Okay, because we've never been at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Okay, so, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| So tell me again, I know we've talked about COPS grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| What does it, it stands for something, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Community-oriented services, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Hey, as a side note, overtime budget for KPD, 1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| I was thinking 1.8, it's 1.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| Deputy Chief Miller, you were fading out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| I couldn't hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| The overtime budget for KPD as budget is 1.3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| 1.326 million, to be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| Okay, well, I don't know what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| to Councilwoman Testerman's eight then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| She finds it, let us know, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| I said 1.8, I was off for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| 1.8 in my brain too, so I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| So just to be clear, those overtime thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| you know, they would fund, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| cases where an officer has to work over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| to conclude a case or an investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| but also fund city special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| and things that we do that we pay overtime for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| for, you know, any kind of, you know, Christmas event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| or the bike rides and things like that that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| So that's where that funding comes from, in a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3702)|
| 1:01:51| Okay, I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| So when, I think this is covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| in the fire department's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| but when we use NARCAN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| is that in the fire department's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| or do you guys have that in your budget too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Now, and I'll defer to Chief Miller on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I believe we got a grant initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| but it is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| So I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| Yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| The initial purchase was grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| And of course, we're providing those as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| If we use them up and we had an excess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| out of that initial grant batch too, that we're using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| but those things do eventually expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| And so they have to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| And I think, I believe, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| I think we've been replacing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| We're replacing them recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| but we replaced those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Commitments out of the general fund or out of a grant item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I'd have to double check to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| Okay, so do you know how much we spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| on things like NARCAN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| What would be your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| But in terms of specific number on NARCAN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| I don't know, Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| unless you can remember something I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| I can tell you that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| we are not spending anything on NARCAN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| It was grant funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| And then I think we managed the last batch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| when this expired, we traded it out with another agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| And I think MDC or somebody had gotten another grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| that provided us with more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| So we have not actually had to purchase it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| in quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| I would just add that I think KFD, the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| probably is using NARCAN at a greater rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| I think that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Like every year they tell us they're using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| like double what they did the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| And it's a huge component of their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| So I didn't know if that covered any of you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| because I know for a call like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| you guys would, it's a first responder call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| So whoever gets there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| I didn't know how much was covered by you guys, by KFD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| We tracked it and we're using it on a very limited rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| We might use it one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| somewhere between one and five times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| So it's not a great expenditure for us at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| And I think there's been a lot of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| with the needle exchange and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| It's some of the people that would need that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| have more access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| So it's been a less burden on us to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| Chief Thomas, I have a personnel budgeting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| So out of the personnel that we have that's listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| how many of those are social workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| And I know that there was a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| with Helen Ross McNabb as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| but could you, do you have that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| really available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| We don't have anybody in the KPD budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| That is their primary job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3894)|
| 1:04:54| But we do have that, the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| the Helen Ross McNabb grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| Yeah, the pilot that you all approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| Yeah, that started back in early October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| and we're going to have an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| from KPD and Helen Ross McNabb are gathering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| I'm going to share that with you all in the public next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3916)|
| 1:05:16| We don't have it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| but we're planning to get that out to you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| Sorry, but I just may add on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| As part of the BHUC funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| they staff social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| for jail avoidance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| What they do is they have social workers there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| who will follow up with the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| that we divert to the BHUC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| They avoid criminal charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| and the folks from Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| do provide that counseling and follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3961)|
| 1:06:15| Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| I don't know if you guys have any more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| but I was going to just give some concluding remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| if you guys are done asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| but if you're not, I can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| I have a question for Ms. Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| I am wondering about the graph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| where the budget was declining by percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| Do you have information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Yeah, the one with the red dots, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| At these points, how much the amounts were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| What was the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| The actual numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| I'm sure that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| I don't have those in front of me, Councilwoman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| but I do think that that would be the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| behind this graph information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Okay, Boyce is telling me he's got a spreadsheet on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| and we can give you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| And then I have another question for Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| So the number of uniformed officers has stayed the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| but the number of hours that are uniformed officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| is about consistent due to overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| You're asking if the number that is allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| to those personal services is about consistent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| If the, I'm not sure, the hours that are worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| like if we were able to hire more officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| we would have more hours worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| So are we having the same amount of hours worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| by the overtime covering those officers that we don't have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| Actually, we're not having the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| No, ma'am, because those hours are overtime hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| which is time and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| So if we had more officers, we would have more hours worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| I was wondering about the financial part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| more the amount of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Actually, let me get to where I really wanted to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| which is, so the population has increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| the number of uniformed officers has stayed the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| What about crime level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| How much analysis is put into looking at crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| what kinds of crime shifts in and how that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| and then responding to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| by making changes within the department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| Sure, and we do that on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| We target where our crime is occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| whether it be crimes against persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| whether it be homicides, whether it be property crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| If you wanna look on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| we have that on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| We have charts in each annual report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| that will show where we were and what we focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| But we do track that on a weekly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| and I have a staff meeting every Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| And so we try to be very current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| with where we need to deploy people to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Yes, yeah, you're responding to the latest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| quote, unquote, trend of crime, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| Thank you, Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| This is Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| I can't see the whole screen either, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| I don't know if I'm jumping in front of somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| But, and this may be a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| that you'll have to get back to us on, boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| Ms. Susan, I don't expect you to know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| But the question for me is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| if the city was a decreasing percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| of the overall city budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| what areas of city budget were growing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| I think that would be an interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| So if the percentage of the overall city budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| for basic public services like police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| were decreasing, what was increasing that made them shrink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| And I don't expect anybody to be able to answer that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| but it would be an interesting question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| for where were we growing our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| Okay, he's getting that question down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| and we'll get back to you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| I just think it's an interesting analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| If something's going down, then something else is growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| taking a bigger part of your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| Council members, I just wanted to say first thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| to all the members of the finance team and KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| for helping prepare this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| And I know Aaron Gill worked a lot on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| And thank you for holding this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| but also a series of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| And I know you may have more questions after I say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| but I just wanna say the series of KPD work sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| that you've had have been really helpful for us internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| as an administration to understand things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| And also, I think as a community, and as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| we've been having meetings out in the community as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| asking people, what does public safety mean to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| How could you feel safer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| And also analyzing the information about calls for service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| and how do we respond to those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| and what are different models?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| So I hear you, I hear the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| I'm also listening to the experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| within our own police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| about how could we innovate to make the city safer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| And does that mean social workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| Does that mean how we interact with ambulances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| Does that mean how we respond to overdose calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| Do we need a different way to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| And more importantly, to follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| so it's not just the same people overdosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| and being administered Narcan over and over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| with no change in the final outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| So we're looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| our Office of Community Empowerment and Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| are talking to people out in the community about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| as much as is possible via virtual meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| and occasional in-person meetings, although not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| And today's meeting was really helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| to understand what the budget is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| because we can't, before we innovate and reform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| and continue to make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| We've done some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| on a sort of small around the edges level already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| but if we're gonna do more considerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| and significant innovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| knowing where we are now is really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| And as hard as COVID has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| I think it's forced all of us, including KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| to look at how can we operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| You know, we're at level one with KPD right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| where they're not responding to traffic incidences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| that don't have any injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| I'm not sure if that is an accurate way of saying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| but when there's no injuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| and people have to file their own reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| with the insurance company or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| So what are these things that we can learn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| And does that open up the door to innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| so we can incorporate those into innovations in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| and have a different way to respond to traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| fender benders, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| But we're looking at all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| we're looking at what they've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| in other cities like Denver, like Eugene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| like Austin, like Pittsburgh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| like other cities big and small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| But we also, I'm very committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| to making sure the solutions fit for Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| because we're not like all those other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| we're our own city and we have our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| There's a lot of overlap with what public safety means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| in every part of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| but we also have some special talents and skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| and circumstances that are unique to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| And so I wanna make sure our innovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| are unique to Knoxville and fit our legal situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| our budget situation and our talents and our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| what our neighborhoods and people want and need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| So we're looking at all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| and this series of workshops has been really fundamental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| to all of us, you council and administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| and the community and helping examine this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| And I'm looking forward to working on some innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| with you all in the months ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| So thank you for calling us and thank you for preparing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| I'll unmute myself now, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| I mean, I'm not calling on people, but Seema Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| Okay, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| I was going to ask, we are not like other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| We have our own flavor in Knoxville, we have our own style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| But we also have the highest amount of poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| in the state of Tennessee, even more so than Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| So it's something we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| It would be interesting to compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| the crime levels between cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| I was looking up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| it seems like Eugene does have a similar population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| but comparing apples to apples sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| I know finances matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| but also seeing what is working in the other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| and how that budget ends up being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| and their crime level altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4543)|
| 1:15:50| Yes, and if I could, for just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| And that's why this is an exciting time for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| because we can look at things like that and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| is this really a police responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Maybe we need somebody else with better expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| to deal with certain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Even something like we regulate taxis in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| should that be a codes enforcement issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| Do we really need to have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| So there's a lot that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| That's why it's exciting for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| because we can be better at what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| Maybe we can be better at just law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| And Chief Miller and I had that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| he brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| So we wanna think outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| And it's hard for us being inside a certain box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| for so many years to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| So even our recruits, our young recruits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| have some great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| And we've been listening to them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| because they're new and they're not into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| And they are so interested in, they give me great hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| They are interested in serving the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| That's why they become recruits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| especially in this time of a lot of civil unrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| and a lot of, that you really have to wanna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| a police officer right now to come to the police academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| And so they give me great hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| and they have some good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| So as we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| there's gonna be some great innovative things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| that come out and some may work, some may not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| but it's great to get a chance to try them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| So I just wanted to say that and thank you council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| And I forgot to mention that Chief Miller is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| and I didn't thank my folks like CFO Juneau did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| but I really appreciate Deputy Chief Miller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| and I apologize, Deputy Chief Cindy Gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| who has years and years of experience in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| is actually out sick today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| So she was not able to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| She had planned on joining us, but so yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| my staff has some years of experience as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| and proud of them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4662)|
| 1:17:50| Council, do we have any additional questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| or comments or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| I can't see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| So you're not on my main screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| and you do wanna say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| if you will just please jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| Okay, I don't think that I see any hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| So I just want to just thank you Mayor and Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| and your staff for being in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4697)|
| 1:18:24| to help us with these workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| and better understanding of the dynamics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| and how the department and the budgeting is set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| I'm really excited to hear that you and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| have already been in conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| about re-imagining on different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| What does policing look like moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| What does that look like as far as relationship building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| especially during such a time as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| where we're seeing so much racial tension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| and everything that's going on nationally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| And look forward to you guys maybe just keeping us updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| on some of your findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| I know it's not like you have a whole lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| but I do appreciate that it's on your radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| So maybe sometime in Q1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| if we could maybe revisit the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| if you have any updates as relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| I'll personally share with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| and share with the mayor that I'd be interested to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| you guys looking at a model and coming back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| and saying, what do you think could work here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| as it relates to having social workers on staff potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| to go out on certain calls and see how they're able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| to maybe work with people with de-escalation skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| and those that are not violent situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| if that can help make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| as far as referring people to certain programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| And so, I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| I know that the work that you guys do is not easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| and I appreciate all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| Public safety, I know a lot of times people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| look at those budgets and think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| wow, that's a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| but our safety has to come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| And I think that we, as city leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| have to be really intentional and be really serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| about the safety of all of our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| here in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| And so, I do appreciate all of your efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| and the time that you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| I will tell you that one of my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Councilwoman Fugate, had stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| wow, this was so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Wouldn't it be nice to have the same conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| around the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| when we're talking about public safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| They go hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| And so, Chief Sharp, I guess we'll kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| put you guys on notice a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| but KPD is giving you the blueprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| on what to present to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| And so, Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Can I defend myself, Council Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| What I was gonna say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| this is very educational for us and for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| And I think as we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| if public safety is such a large expenditure for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| it would not be bad for us to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| what are our numbers for fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| What kind of calls do they go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| As the conversation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| who's best to answer a 911 call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| has come up in this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| it would be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| So, thanks for throwing me under the bus there, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| But I did, I do think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| Yeah, and actually the mayor did recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| and suggest that early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| but I knew that council on the onset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| was more focused primarily on better understanding of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| So, I think that we're now in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Most council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| is anyone opposed to doing a mini series, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| as relates to fire as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Sounds like we'll look to move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| So, council, if there are no additional questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Again, thank you everyone for presenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| and putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Mr. Johnson, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| we'll go ahead and have public forum now, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Our first public forum speaker will be Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| Mr. Givens, I've enabled you to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4956)|

| 1:22:40| Hi, I'm Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| I live at 1823 Explorer Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| First, thank you for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| I found it very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| Two brief comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Though the population of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| has increased police officers per 1000 population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| is still in line with other cities listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| regardless of our current growth as shown on slide 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| If anything, in 2016, we were well above the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| and our drop in 2018 brought us closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| to the average for our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| As far as the police percentage of city budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| to the red dotted line graph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| the pension change of course affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| the city's largest department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| with the largest personnel expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| by the largest amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| If you eliminate that drop in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| I believe most years show that the police budget increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| relative to the remainder of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| And I think if you look at slide 29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| you will see that that drop really is an outlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| and that red dotted line is pretty invalid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| from a mathematical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| But that's not really what I wanna talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| First, I wanted to say that I absolutely believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| in giving credit where it's due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| So I wanna commend Chief Thomas and the KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| for the revised wording in general order 1.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| in the August update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| The new wording that directly forbids officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| from employing chokeholds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Additional steps could be adding minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| and maximum penalties for violating department policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| and to the public document and forbidding prone restraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| Prone restraint is well known to be deadly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| especially for people with underlying medical conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| I would think that'd be an especially a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| in the time of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| And the Knox County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| employed prone restraint in the death of Jonathan Binkley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| in July of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| The department is now defending against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| a multimillion dollar lawsuit in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| I would also like to thank the Mayor, Chief and KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| as a whole for rolling out the body cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| to a test set of officers handpicked by the command staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| I wish that Park had been more involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| in selecting the officers chosen for the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| but I agree that time is of the essence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| as we are currently five months behind the Mayor's promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| to have all officers equipped by July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| but I appreciate the progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| However, I have to criticize the pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| for law enforcement and behavioral health partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| that was mentioned a little bit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| This seems like an underfunded half measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| It's a type of bureaucratic can kicking exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| that ignores the actual requests of activists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| and the recommendations of experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| The selected co-responder model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| includes a law enforcement officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| and a behavioral health professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| that respond jointly to calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| Such an officer led and that is indeed officer led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| approach to mental health is how Sierra McCauley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| a naked 23 year old woman was killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| by KPD officer James Gad in November of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| Crisis response should be led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| by mental health professionals who can summon the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| if they as the lead on the scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| determine that trained gunmen are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| Men with guns more often than not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| aggravate mental health crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| Speaking of trained gunmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| our officers receive a ton of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| more than twice the National Post peace officer standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| and training recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| However, most of that extra training focuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| on the exciting parts of police work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| instead of the effective ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| For firearms defense training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| for firearms and defense training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| Post recommends a total of 80 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| KPD trainees receive 228 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| For human relations, communications, ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| and emergency medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Post recommends 68 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| KPD trainees receive 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| Let's stop and think about those numbers for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| Combat training gets 2.8 times the Post recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| while human interaction only gets one and a half times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| the already lower Post standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| Who exactly are we expecting our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| to face in the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| Citizens or enemy combatants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| Well, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| What should our officers expect in the streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| In 2018, there were 20 murders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| and 4,139 violent crimes in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| The FBI UCR reports a national clearance rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| for murders at 62%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Knoxville did fairly well clearing 55%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| For all violent crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| the FBI reports a 46% clearance rate with KPD at 24%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| Mr. Givens, you have one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| All told, KPD received 20,000 crime reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| and made 11,000 arrests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| So they caught about half of the reported perps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| They also issued 108,000 citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| which are obviously nonviolent offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| So our folks in blue trained twice as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| for doing violence as they do for talking to citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| but they spend the vast majority of their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| writing tickets and handling nonviolent offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| This leaves me wondering why KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| has an armored personnel carrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| and military rifles in nearly every patrol car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| To my admittedly limited knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| no KPD officer has been shot by a suspect since 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| when officer Jimmy Wilson was shot in his vest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| and no officer has been killed on duty since 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| Yet between 2018 and 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| KPD only solved 22 out of 46 murders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| and killed three people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| two unarmed men and one naked woman with a knife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| Our city is not dangerous for our police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| but our police are dangerous for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| I would like to close by revisiting where I opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| Banning chokeholds and rolling out body cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| are great steps towards a more just police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| and I'm proud of our city and its government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| for taking these steps, but it is not nearly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Our police are not frontline warriors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| in the battle against crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| Our social workers are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| and our budgets reflect that moral priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| Thank you, Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Our next speaker is Ms. Sarah Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| Ms. Hawkins, I'm enabling you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| If you'd please begin with your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| Hi, can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Yes, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| My name is Dr. Sarah Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| I work at 538 West 5th Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| I am a clinical psychologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| and I work kind of on the front lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| with the patients who are likely to be served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| by the co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| So my first kind of thing that I wanted to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| with you guys is my experience thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| with the co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| I recently had them come out to the clinic where I work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| in response to my request for an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| I didn't ask for the police, but the police arrived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| and this was a situation where my patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| was essentially unnecessarily forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| to interact with police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| They did nothing that the EMS team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| that I asked for wouldn't have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| I was appreciative that there was a behavioral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| health provider to hand my patient off to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| but I will share with you that my patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| has experienced multiple instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| of difficult situations with the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| including situations where my patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| they felt that they had been assaulted by PPE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| while they were intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| My patient was intoxicated when I called for an EMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| to take them to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| When I was on the phone with my patient waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| for what I thought was an ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| they knock on the door, and my patient says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| great, now the police are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| and I'm about to be arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| This was traumatizing for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| It would be traumatizing for a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| who have had negative experiences with the police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| who are themselves overwhelmed, distressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| experiencing a mental health crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| experiencing a substance use crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| and I do not think that police were necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| or helpful in that particular interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| And I also wanna note that, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| I'm a clinical psychologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| I work on the front lines caring for people of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| and I had no idea that the co-response team was working yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| I have been at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| I have been listening for updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| that we were promised by Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| but they hadn't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| So as a member of the public, I didn't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| and as a professional who would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| to potentially interact with the co-response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| to the benefit of my patients, I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| That's not gonna work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| If the people who need to utilize the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| are not aware that it exists, what are we measuring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| How are we going to assess the effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| of this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| I was also not contacted for follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| to determine what the outcomes were for my patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| when they discharged from the place that they went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| So that's something that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| that we need to really carefully look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| if we want this pilot program to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| And the last thing that I wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| is related to comments and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| that y'all had earlier on about naloxone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| Naloxone is the generic name of Narcan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| which is the medication that reverses opioid overdose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| and saves lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| I absolutely, wholeheartedly, emphatically, passionately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| want you to continue to find Narcan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| in whatever department feels appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| I understand we're talking about KPD budget here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| Chief Thomas said it's not a huge component of their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| but Narcan is an essential ingredient in harm reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| and in fighting the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| Dr. Hawkins, you have one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Repeated doses of Narcan does not equal no change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| in the final outcome, as Mayor Kim Cannon said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| Repeated doses of Narcan saves lives repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| I don't think that we are recognizing the amount of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| that goes into treating substance use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| when we dismiss administering Narcan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| to a person multiple times as an ineffective strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| That is harm reduction, that is saving a life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| and saving a life is necessary in order to change a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| Narcan should never, never, never be withheld from somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| because they have used it before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| or because it's been administered to them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| I didn't hear anybody say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| but I really wanna emphasize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| because I work with folks in activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| and I work with folks who are in recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| and Narcan is an essential ingredient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| in caring for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Thank you guys for putting your brains together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| and working on these important problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| I wholeheartedly support the efforts that you're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| to decrease the police budget and to support resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| that can enhance the lives and the safety of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| Thank you, Mayor Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Thank you, Ms. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| Vice Mayor, that's the conclusion of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| All right, thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| And I just wanna thank the two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| who signed up to speak to Council during public forum today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| Council and our guest speakers today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| that concludes our last KPD workshop in this series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| I wanna again, thank everyone for your diligence and your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| and again, our meeting is now adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Please have a good evening and be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| Bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5638)|
| 1:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201203?start=5638)|
