| 0:10:40| What's the new concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| It's a special event center on North Broadway, the old printer building, that really ugly blue building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=642)|

| 0:11:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=690)|

| 0:11:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| So just hang on to that, and we'll save it to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| To March, 30 days, is that what we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Yeah, to the March meeting, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=703)|

| 0:12:03| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| We are waiting on the sales tax registration and building inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| If I could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| I know that there's been questions around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| We've done our best to meet with Officer Coward and Captain Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| and so I know that y'all didn't receive the drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| You may not have seen them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| I emailed those out today to make sure that you at least had them by this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| I understand that this is a unique concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| and obviously this is something we want to be a good and safe thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| in addition to being fun and a good addition to the West Town Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| and its renovation that's going on over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| So I'm open to deferring if we need to for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| It would be helpful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Obviously we've tried to do plans that were we got good guidance from KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| as far as what would designate the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| and what would provide a good safe environment for us to sell beer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| So we've added those, a railing to provide a barrier there around that kiosk there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| in the center of the food court at West Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| But I also understand that if there needs to be any questions answered or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| I'm more than happy to assist there and try to resolve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| But if we need 30 days to do that, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Mr. King, I had a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| When we discussed this last time, we talked about having a defined space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| And so what I could see from the plans that you submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| it looks like you've restricted it to an area in the center of the food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| However, it looks like there's seating around the wall that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Is that an area where there would be beer served as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| Do you mean, so we've got this, there's seating between, basically we've got bar seating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| and then we have tables with chairs that are between the bar and the railing itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| Is that what you're talking about, that seating there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| So outside of that space, you just talked about having a railing or a wall at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| Is there beer that's going to be allowed outside of that space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Beer is only allowed inside that space, and so there's one entrance in and out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| in addition to an emergency exit that has an alarmed push bar door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| One of those panels will actually function as a door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| and it'll sound an alarm if somebody were to try to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| And we've designed the railing at a height that the chairs that are on the inside of that railing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| were someone to reach up and hand it over that railing, it would become obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| So that was part of the rationale for the height where we designed that railing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| How tall is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Forty-eight inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Is that a solid structure, or is that just a railing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| Solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| So for the first two foot ten inches, it's a solid panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| and then on top of that is another foot of metal railing, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| and then you've got a foot of glass on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| So totally it ends up being 48 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| So it's a total of 48 inches from the ground to the top of the glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| Above finish floor, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| And what about your server compliance plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| You're in the middle of the Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| You've got a lot of underage folks that are going to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| We talked about last time that there's easy ways to get in and out of the building right there, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=940)|
| 0:15:53| It seems to me like the server plan is kind of at the most basic level it could possibly be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| We're going to card folks and go through our 60-day training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| I think that's a little wanting for this space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| so I have a little bit of issue with wanting to see a lot more detail where you're trying to locate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=968)|
| 0:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Yeah, I mean, again, we've also got one entrance in and out that they're going to be monitoring as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| but we can definitely take a look at that as far as what else might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| And you mentioned there's one exit from – I guess there's an emergency exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| Emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| There's another entrance and exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| What measures are you going to put in place to prevent underage folks from coming in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| and what measures are you going to take place to make sure that drinks aren't moving out of that space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| Yeah, so we'll have it appropriately staffed with a minimum of two people that will be monitoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| So it's a fairly small space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| The bar itself is 445 square feet, I think, total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| When you add the perimeter, it's a 1,600-square-foot space, again, of which 445 is taken up by the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| So it's very limited in terms of how much space people are actually occupying outside of that bar space within that perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1032)|
| 0:17:21| But we will have two staff that are monitoring that and in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| We also, of course, because it's Simon Malls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| they'll also have security personnel that's monitoring the food court as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| Will there be somebody sitting at that entrance that's carding people as they come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| What's your process for carding folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| We will card them at the bar is the plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| So if somebody was to miss somebody who's underage coming in and sitting down at one of the tables, how would you deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1067)|
| 0:17:58| They're not coming to the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Well, it's not a 21-and-over space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| We have other soft drinks, non-alcoholic beverages and things that are also available for purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| So coming into the space, you're not prohibited if you're under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| At that point, it becomes like any other restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| If you're in the restaurant, you only have beer if you've been carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| The final question I had is just with regard to the paperwork that you turned into us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Obviously, it didn't make it into our packets because it got turned in later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| When did you have those plans completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| We got our final permit set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| I believe we got comments back actually from the city beginning of last week, which we then provided revisions to the tooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1120)|
| 0:18:50| I think they wanted revisions to the exit signage and also, honestly, I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1130)|
| 0:18:58| I think exit signage was the big issue in raising the emergency exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| So we got that all done at the end of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| I thought I noticed on the documentation that it was earlier in February that you had this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| We did have things turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| We got notes back from the city that we had to get revised drawings for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| One thing that I'd like to just say is that it is very difficult for everyone to get this stuff at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1159)|
| 0:19:28| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| It looked to me like you had the plans completed because there was a date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| I don't have it in front of me right this second, but it was, I think, early February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| It's difficult for me to understand why that wasn't turned in earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| Then it could have made it into the packet, and we could have hashed out these things earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| I think you had meetings with folks that you needed to have meetings with just here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1191)|
| 0:20:00| Yeah, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| I may have misunderstood that, that it was on me to send out those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| George and I talked today about that, and so I sent them as quickly as I could after I talked with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| So I may have misunderstood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| It was my understanding to meet with KPD and provide a railing to the plans that I had submitted last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| and so I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| I mean, I certainly would have been happy to have gotten them to you sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| I didn't realize that that was a part of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| In the past, I've always submitted for a beer permit, and we've submitted things through the city, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| So I'm happy to, again, if we need to defer a month so we have time to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| and I can answer any other questions or concerns, I'm happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| Well, I'm sure some of my colleagues will have some questions, too, so I'll pass on to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| First, I just wanted to know if you were aware that it looks like the school district is moving their alternative school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1255)|
| 0:21:03| over to the West Town Mall from Knoxville Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| And I guess this is maybe a question for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| If there's anything that we need to be aware of as far as the proximity of this establishment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1272)|
| 0:21:22| It hasn't moved yet, but my understanding is that's in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Any business that has a beer permit right now, as well as anyone that currently has a beer permit pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1286)|
| 0:21:35| would be able to go forward even if the school sat down within feet of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1295)|
| 0:21:44| Once the school is established there, then future applicants would have the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| So I think what that brings to my mind, though, is just to get back to this issue of Councilman Roberto's concerns about compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1313)|
| 0:22:02| And, you know, there are children already, you know, underage youth who are in the mall all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| but there will be an added element of sort of a formal relationship with a youth serving or education organization in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1330)|
| 0:22:19| So it will be particularly important that the compliance measures are strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| I'm looking at this drawing, and, you know, again, to reiterate, we didn't receive this until late this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| so I did not have a chance to look at this, but I'm looking at it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| And I see a circle, and I can see where there's a barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| but it looks to me like there are stools on both sides of the barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Yeah, there is some seating that's right up against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| On the outside as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| On the outside, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| So there will be service to the outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| So those stools are for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| That's just food court seating that Simon's providing, yeah, for their food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| If you're talking about outside the perimeter, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| So will the barrier be like I'm sitting at a stool and the barrier will come up like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| or will I be able to, I guess I'm trying to, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| but this is, to me, important as far as the potential for alcohol to get outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| Yeah, whether beer can travel over the barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| So I think that that was a way to provide what's known as banquettes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| to provide some kind of physical barrier that matches, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| what they're trying to accomplish in terms of the look of the food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| If you don't mind, I'm going to pull this up just so I make sure I'm talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| So you can see it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Yeah, so I can look at it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| It doesn't help that it's so small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| And so basically what we will be providing is something of a, well, I say we will be providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| Simon actually is going to provide these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| I'm looking at the top of this sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| You're looking at this, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| And so the height of that is not necessarily confined to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| whatever the height is of that railing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I can work with Simon too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| They've been in conversation with us as well and with Knoxville Police Department as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| and so they understand what the concern is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| and so I know that they're more than willing and ready to comply, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| whatever that needs to be in order to prevent beer from passing over that perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I just wanted to make sure I was reading that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Yeah, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| I don't have their elevations, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| of what that's going to look like because that's what they're supplying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| but that's obviously something I can track down to see exactly what they have in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Could you tell us what your staffing plan will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| The staffing plan is to have two staff that are working the bar and then also busing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| You know, one will be out busing tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| So if you would just indulge me for a moment because I know this concept would be new in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| Is there another concept of this nature in the state of Tennessee currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| I know that you gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| We have some information that says that this is in the state of South Carolina and I think Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| And North Carolina as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| And North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| And Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Are there any in the state of Tennessee currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| In the state of Tennessee, I believe in the ñ I better be careful because I thought one was in the airport at Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1548)|
| 0:25:59| but to be honest with you, I better just refrain and double check before I say that with certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| And an airport, I think, is a different setting than a mall because in an airport, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| you're not going to have a lot of kids, underage kids that are unattended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| but at a mall you're definitely going to have that demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| And so I would venture to say that we probably don't have one in a mall here in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| but I think we could probably find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| So when a person, if I'm a patron, I come up to the door, am I greeted by a host or a hostess and seated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| or do I just kind of walk in and then someone comes to assist me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| You walk in and place your order at the bar, at which point you would get carded to verify that you're of legal drinking age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1592)|
| 0:26:41| and then you'll sit anywhere inside that perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| And it would function much very similar to like a Hopps and Hollers, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| or, you know, a Sutry's downtown, something like that, where you come in, place your order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| and then take a seat, you know, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| And then you also mentioned that there would be other non-alcoholic beverages served, such as soft drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| So a teenager could come into your establishment, walk up to the bar and order a soft drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| And they would be, then they would go and they could sit anywhere in the area with people that are next to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| that could be their friend that is of age and is having a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| I guess theoretically that's possible, yeah, or a child with their parent, for example, or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| And so do you feel that two employees at all times would be adequate enough, because we all know teenagers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| and we all have been teenagers before, to monitor to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| you have an underage person sitting next to a group of friends that are able to purchase beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| that they would not, you know, slide a beer down, and I can take a couple of sips or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| We believe it's sufficient, modeled on other, you know, similar concepts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| where you have a similar size footprint and doing a similar product offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| We do see that that does tend to work, you know, within this size footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| What is your seating capacity in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| I believe we have, well, I can tell you we have 33 at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1693)|
| 0:28:23| It looks like we have about 20 plus, so we have about 50 that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| Total seating capacity of 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| It looks like the total occupancy is 86.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| If I'm reading that correctly, and I'm sorry, it's very small, but I believe that's the total occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1720)|
| 0:28:51| So I think what we're showing is around 50, 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| So I think, and please correct me if I'm misinterpreting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| so you'll have a bar that seats 33 people, you'll have one person that is working the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| and you'll have another employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Will both employees be working the bar, or will one be kind of monitoring what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| It will be, of course, determined by what's happening at any time during the operating hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| but yes, one would be able to be freed up to actually work the floor, to bus tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| to ensure that we're enforcing what we need to be enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Will you have your own security there, or will you be dependent on the mall security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| As far as security is concerned, we'll be dependent upon the mall security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| I have not had an opportunity to fully read through this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| I'm sure that I will have additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| I'm happy to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Councilwoman St. Paris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Yes, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| You've compared it to a restaurant in that people can just come in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| Will there be food served there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Bar snacks, but not, you know, peanuts, popcorn, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| Since you're open to a postponement, I would prefer that so that we can see that seating arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| and how high the barrier is, and then also what the school issue may be coming up ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| So if that's okay with you, I'd like to move to make a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| For how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| Thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| I'd like to extend that to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Mr. King, there's a stamp on your documents that says it was completed February 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Today is February 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| You heard a lot of questions today about, you know, we've got some concerns about the height of the barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1854)|
| 0:31:02| whether or not you're going to have somebody greeting folks, carding them at that moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| so that they know what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| And we've been down this road before where we've made some different delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| So I want to make sure that we have enough time for you to get everything in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| so that when we do see you next time, everything is in order and we can make a final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| But I'd caution you to make sure you turn those documents into us in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| so that we can review them properly and that the folks that are up here that are working so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| to make sure that other folks can get their beer permits as well aren't having to do things at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| So if you're okay with that friendly amendment, I'd like to move it to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Counsel Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| I think there seem like a lot of questions, so a post-moment is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| I guess I had one question for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Does KPD have an opinion on what's been proposed or had time to review it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| It was my understanding that the plans and review had rejected the plans that were submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1927)|
| 0:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I feel it would probably be necessary to sit down with the law department plans and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| and have everyone together so that we can get on the same page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| and that way going forward we'll be able to answer any and all questions the board has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| So the motion before us is to postpone it for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Postpone it for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1967)|
| 0:32:56| Tennessee Valley Earth Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=1976)|

| 0:33:25| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2007)|

| 0:35:57| We received the mechanical and HVAC and electrical today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| Deployment should be done this week and then the city inspection maybe by the middle of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| So 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| 30 days I think would be very sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Is there a motion to extend for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Move motion for 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2177)|

| 0:36:46| It was approved final documentation August 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| They did not appear in November, but the board granted them a 30-day extension and a 60-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| and they're not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| So is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| If the board takes no action and it fails, but they're entitled to come back in and apply again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| Has anybody heard from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| We sent a registered letter last time and it was returned to us unaccepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| This time we emailed and called but have not gotten a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| So, Mr. Frost, is it the same as if we take no action or deny it, the same thing occurs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Your only option is to extend it, or if you take no action, it dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| Do you want to take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| I'd suggest we move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2255)|

| 0:37:46| Long list here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| It was approved final documentation April 25th, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| 30-day extension was granted in July and meeting to August, so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| 90-day extension was granted in November to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| They're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Construction is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| We actually did contact somebody by phone and spoke to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| I'm not sure why they're not here tonight, but they are indicated that they're still trying to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| So we did at least get a live body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| You want my light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Yeah, I want you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| What do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Turn my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Show you it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| I would be in favor of them applying again if they're interested in a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| This has been over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Who are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| I'm a partner in that business, but it was not my name on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| I'm here for a different application, but if you want, I can speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| I didn't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| My name is not on the application, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| But I'm a partner in that LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| But the background checks are of the person who filled out the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| I've not done the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| At this point, it's been around 10-ish months since those background checks were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| So if anything has happened in the meantime, we haven't been notified of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| So it really is to the point now where there needs to be a new application and new background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| He's not the owner or the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| So we'll just apply again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2363)|

| 0:40:49| The Bourbon Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Kareem Boughani, 319 Lowell Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| So we approve pending final documentation in November still requiring a plan for server compliance and building inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| and fire inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Yeah, we had a contractor bail out on us, so we still have some more work to do outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| So if you could defer it for 60 days, it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Sixty days is the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| I make a motion to give them an extension for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| 60 days. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| All right, so we have an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Is that where we are, Will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Am I on track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| CEO Inc. doing business as Paul's Oasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2494)|
| 0:41:44| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Paul Osterbring for Paul's Oasis, 8021 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| So in May of 2017, you decided for a sale to miners, the first in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2511)|
| 0:41:59| You submitted a remedial plan end of May, February 1st of 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| cited for a sale to miners, the second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| You've had notice of administrative hearing and received remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| and the $500 fine has been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| So tonight we have, this is the first for several of us for administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| we have the option to accept the plan that's been submitted or ask him any questions for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| or we can ask it to go to a revocation hearing, suspension hearing, if we don't feel it's adequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2548)|
| 0:42:39| or we, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| So I'll start with you, Mr. Cordova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| I would like to give you an update on the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| Is that the bartender who did the serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| When him and I talked, when I was writing the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| he was going to go take the class again to make sure he understood the ID identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| He told me the other day he was not going to attend the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| so he's no longer going to be working with us as of Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| So was this bartender the one that was being cited for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| Yeah, on February 1st, yes, that was the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| So I guess in your own words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| what do you feel like the issue was with having these two citations in a two-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| Well, the first one, the girl who did the first one, she just didn't check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| I mean, she wasn't even busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| She just didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| But on this one, he actually, the girls, I even watched them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| I saw the girls come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| They sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| He checked their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| He was talking to them just to make sure they were okay to be served to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| He even questioned them on one of the girls' expiration date because it was coming up on her ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| And when he looked at it, the date was 98 on it, and he looked at it as 96.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| But he took time to even talk to them just to make sure everything was okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| and he just read it as 96.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| I mean, there's no excuse for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I can't come up with any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| I mean, I knew his mom was in the hospital and was having heart surgery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| but I told him still, you've got to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| This is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| It has to be perfect every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| So what's your plan going forward to make sure this doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| I've talked to all my bartenders, reiterated to them that you just don't look at the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| There's other things on the driver's license you can look at to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| and if their dates are in the 90s, question them a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| Talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Ask them their birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Make sure you just don't look at it and hand it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| Actually talk to them about their ID and make sure, number one, it is them, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| and number two, that you're not misreading it for whatever reason it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| And I had no excuse for him doing it because all the lights were up, it was daytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| I mean, he just misread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| Are you aware that if you get a third citation in a two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| that you don't even see us and go straight to revocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| I'm fully aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| And so I guess the last thing I'd ask you is tell us why we shouldn't send you to the revocation hearing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2728)|
| 0:45:37| why we should give you that next chance right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Because I'm telling you, I'm sitting down with all my bartenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| and actually I talk to them at least once a week about it just to make sure they're aware of the ID situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| and keep checking, keep asking questions, just to keep reminding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| I mean, yeah, we've done this a two-year period, but we've also had other inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| I've been over here 13-plus years, and we've passed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| So it's unfortunate, no excuse for it, because you have to be perfect every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I've got children, I've got grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| I fully understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| So what you're telling me is that every week you're going to be doing a review of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| I talk to them all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| And when anybody comes in, I'll look at the person and see if they look old enough, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| I'll make sure they check their IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| And if we have not checked your ID before, we don't know you, we're checking your ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2794)|
| 0:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| I'll make sure no one else has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Ms. Rotter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| So some restaurants that you go into and bars, the vendors actually, so the alcohol sales folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| will provide, honestly, wall art or placards that will be branded with the particular alcohol brand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| or Budweiser or Tito's or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| And it will say those born before, and it's a date chart, so you change the day every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Do you have one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Is it prominently displayed that your servers would be able to check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| Did you have it at the time of this incident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| So it said 1998 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| Well, what I'm saying, it wasn't that he did math wrong in his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| When he looked at the ID, he thought it said 96 when, in fact, it did say 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| He misread the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| And so question for KPD, though I guess this is a state-issued ID issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| aren't IDs for those under 21, is it current or is it future that they are a different orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| and somehow they look different than an over 21 ID to help the servers out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| Yes, the under 21 IDs have a red box around the picture with a birth date that says under 21 until this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2873)|
| 0:48:05| It was my understanding that in 2017 the under 21 licenses were supposed to be oriented vertically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2885)|
| 0:48:13| I don't know that the state is going to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| So it hasn't gone into effect yet to change the orientation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Well, I wish they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| I sorely wish they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| It makes it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Ms. McQueen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| I don't know if this is a question to the applicant or if someone who serves on this board can help me since I'm new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2907)|
| 0:48:34| What is the difference between the ABC server knowledge class and this task class that's mentioned in your remediation plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2914)|
| 0:48:43| It's basically the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| It's the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| And is it a requirement that every bartender participate in this particular class, this server knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| If you have your service permit in Tennessee, you have to go attend the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| It's a five-hour class you have to attend to get your service permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| And your remediation plan for the incident last year, that person went back and got a recertification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| Yes, she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Yes, she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| She went back and she retook the class to make sure that she understood the ID verification process more clearly and the importance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2947)|
| 0:49:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| And your proposed remediation for the incident for the server in February was for this person to attend that class as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| He told me he would, and then he came back to me last week and said he wouldn't do it, and thus he's no longer going to be working for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| How often does a bartender have to recertify or attend this class, or is it even a requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| Every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Yeah, if the service permit's good for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| So are we comfortable with his plan that he submitted, or do we want him to go to the additional hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| That's really the question before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| I guess that was my follow-up for Mr. Frost, was just, you know, our options here, we can take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| which would mean that everything remains as is and we're basically approving his plan, or we can send him to the revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3001)|
| 0:50:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| If you approve tonight, that doesn't reset anything for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| If he goes out and picks up a third citation, as you correctly said earlier, he goes straight to the hearing officer for a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3013)|
| 0:50:24| I'd say I'm satisfied with his answers today, so I would move that we take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| We don't need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| You don't have to make a motion, so we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| And the last, that's it for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Is Natour here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Mr. Natour is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Mr. Natour, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Yeah, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| Oh, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| So, beer board, this is really trying to help you and us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| What we wanted to do in the last two minutes of our meeting, last year we approved this new concept, POUR, on Jackson Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3068)|
| 0:51:19| where people, if you've not been there, you can come in and it's self-serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| We worked with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| We rewrote the ordinance to allow for this based on a number of things that he has provided down there for their controls of serving and not over-serving and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3087)|
| 0:51:38| He is asking whether one of the stipulations that was made last year was that it was a 21 and over bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3098)|
| 0:51:47| And so what we're asking, Rob sent you all a memorandum just to give you a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3107)|
| 0:51:54| We're not voting on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| We're asking Mr. Natour to come and briefly explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| And what we want to know is there a consensus to take this to council to change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| And you'll get more information about all that or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| So, anyway, that's the basis in our two minutes that are left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| State your name and your address for the record, and we can talk about it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Sam Natour, owner of PORTRACT from Knoxville, 207 West Jackson Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| The concept, just a refresher, basically, it's like you said, it's self-serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| So you come in, we scan your ID, a government-issued ID, be it a passport or a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| You must be obviously 21 or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| If the driver's license is already in use in the business, we will flag it in case anyone tries to use the license twice for their friend or for a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| That's not permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Anything that's been used under the tier 21 has been reported to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| And we also have cases where licenses are expired, and without any other secondary form of ID, that person is rejected from entering the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3170)|
| 0:52:58| What we have is, assuming that you have a proper ID, that you're 21 and up, and you provide a credit card for a deposit for the bracelet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| you will be given an RFID-supported bracelet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| This allows you to activate one of 68 digital tabs that we have, showing all the technology, the pricing, the beer, the alcohol content, etc., etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3188)|
| 0:53:18| for full transparency and disclosure for the patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| The idea of allowing those under 21, I admit, is a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| So we've provided several options for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| One would be no minors after 7 p.m., which is peak hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| I do not have hard data to support this next statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| but the majority of those who wish to enter under the age of 21 are parents with strollers or those with toddlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| And they happen to have, usually on the weekends, during the day, well before peak hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| So the reason for me being here is to possibly use a judgment call to allow those to enter the premises with those strollers or toddlers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3228)|
| 0:53:56| because I naturally assume there's not going to be force-fed alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| I understand that those under the age of 21, especially during peak hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| will be challenging for us to mitigate risk and to mitigate making sure that it's also safe for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| Chief Roche and I mentioned in the KPD dimension last time when we were invited last July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| that servers have more intimate interactions with tables and, therefore, are more likely to spot violators of those who are not 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3256)|
| 0:54:25| We don't have that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| It would be very challenging for us despite that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| It's self-serve, but it's still a lot of people out on the floor making sure it's safe for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| So that part would be understandably challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| I do not have a plan for that in case that's being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| What I do have a plan for is how do we allow minors to enter the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| provided they're accompanied with a parent or legal guardian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| The next question of that would be, at what age do we stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| So that's really all I have as far as allowing minors into the premises for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| So the question before us tonight is whether you've heard enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| to whether you'd like to see it come forward to City Council to discuss changing the ordinance to allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| Is there some way that we want to modify it to some of the suggestions that he did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| That's really tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Or you can say, no, I mean, this is really just a straw poll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| There's no bearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| It's just whether to bring it to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| That's kind of what our intention was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| I have a question in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Is this just for parents with their children or any minors before seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| Parents with their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Most state laws require a parent or legal guardian to be accompanied by a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| Regardless, we want to be that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| So, yeah, not just any minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| They have to be with a parent or legal guardian to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3341)|
| 0:55:51| Obviously, it's a two-way conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| I'm more than happy to discuss with KPD to learn about, obviously, what I do not know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| whether it's history of intoxication or et cetera, et cetera, within the minor community in Barnes and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| So I'm all ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| This is just an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| We're not going to be hurting otherwise, but it's something that I think will benefit some patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| who just want to get out with their kid without having to have a babysitter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Councilman Wallace, I assume we will hear from KPD and their take, their ideas, their reaction to this and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3376)|
| 0:56:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| So I'll just leave it with you, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Why don't you contact council with your name and your e-mail, and they can converse with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| and then we'll see about bringing it to council, unless there's another suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| We're running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| That's my only idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| Are there other cities that have ordinances that reflect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| I missed that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Are there other cities in Tennessee that have ordinances for similar establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| that reflect allowing minors with parental supervision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Or would we be the first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| We patterned this after their store in Asheville, North Carolina, to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180227?start=3430)|
