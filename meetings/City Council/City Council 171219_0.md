| 0:02:48| Consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| For the mayor's report, first I want to again welcome our five new council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| who were sworn in on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| We're going to be spending a lot of time together over my next two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| and I know my administration and I look forward to working with you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| So congratulations to Vice Mayor Saunders for being chosen as vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| Councilman George Wallace as beer board chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| and Councilwoman Gwen McKenzie as the council rep to the Knoxville Transportation Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| So a few reminders about the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| Our city offices will be closed next Monday for the Christmas holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| and the Monday after that for New Year's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| There will be no trash or recycling pickup on Christmas Day, on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| which means that the pickup schedule will be delayed by one day for the rest of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| So if you're a Monday pickup like I am, it gets picked up on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| If you're a Tuesday pickup, it gets picked up on Wednesday all the way through the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| Also, because we do anticipate extra household waste over the next two weeks with the holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| including all the packing material and plastic and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| our trash contractor, Waste Connections, will pick up extra bags set outside along the garbage can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| So normally you have to fit all of your garbage in the trash can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| but for only the next two weeks, if you have the trash properly bagged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| and you have it next to the can, the trash can, we will pick that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| So please make sure it's properly bagged so that we're able to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| Of course, we also encourage everyone to recycle as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| and remember to take your glass bottles down to the convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Okay, so we have our annual New Year's Eve celebration on Market Square the evening of December 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| Music will start at 10 p.m. with a countdown and ball drop at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| Also, the Holidays on Ice skating rink will be open daily through Sunday, January 7, except on Christmas Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=293)|
| 0:05:02| You can find information about all of the holiday events online at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=302)|
| 0:05:11| Finally, I also want to remind everybody that there will not be a City Council meeting in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| Normally we meet every two weeks, but earlier this year Council voted to postpone that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| and so instead of January 2, our next meeting will be on Tuesday, January 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| I hope everybody enjoys the next few weeks and has some great time with family and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| That's the end of my report. Are there any reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| There being none, we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| 8A is a resolution approving the appointment of the members of the City's Council Audits Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| Mayor, I would like to move that this be approved, but you probably want to know who we're approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| I have asked Marshall Stair to serve as Chair of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| Andrew Roberto, Seema Singh-Perez, Lauren Ryder, and Gwen McKenzie to serve as members of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| So that is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| And those names are on the copy at our desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=369)|

| 0:09:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Mr. Seymour, you signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Is that only if there are questions or did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| Just if there are questions, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| I don't know whether Mr. Roberto wanted me to explain why we're in this predicament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| If you would, just tell us briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| This is Exhibit A for Recode Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| This shopping center is the Cheryl Hills Shopping Center down on Kingston Pike Academy Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| is the lead tenant in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Our client wants to put a tire store where tires are sold, minor repairs are done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| tires and automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Property is on PC1, which would allow a gasoline service station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| We assumed that would allow our client's business in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| However, Mr. Aarons disagreed with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| The last gasoline service station I'm aware of in the city of Knoxville was Alvin Fry's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| in Fountain City and he died last year, unfortunately, and that gasoline service station is out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| After discussion with MPC staff and MPC, all the tenants wanted this business in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| We applied for the C6 zone and that was what MPC recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| It does require that we go back for site plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=658)|

| 0:11:05| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Fred D. Thompson, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| in the amount of $55,000 to provide governmental relations services for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| I think you all had an opportunity to meet Tony before the meeting, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| There he is right there and he's here if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Counselor is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Yeah, I just thought for the benefit of the new members and the public at large, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| have Mr. Thompson introduce himself and talk about what he does on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Thank you, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| I'm Tony Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| I'm an attorney and lobbyist over in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| I've had the pleasure and honor to represent the city of Knoxville for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| over two decades now, through several administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| I've really enjoyed working with this administration and the legal team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| I greatly appreciate their assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| What I do is basically serve as your eyes, ears, and mouthpiece over at the state capitol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| I work with the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| I go through the couple of thousand bills that are introduced each year and sort those out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| try to determine which ones we will care about and which ones we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| and then work with the staff to prioritize those and make sure our positions are known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| I also coordinate a lot with other city lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| All the big four cities have lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| There's also the Tennessee Municipal League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| We work hand-in-hand together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| We have weekly meetings, spend a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| As you know, all the issues that affect city government are generally addressed in some form or fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=759)|
| 0:12:48| at the General Assembly, and so there's usually about 200 bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| About 10% of the bills is usually what I flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| Of course, the ones we're opposed that we're successful in defeating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| for instance, in a two-year legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| if we were able to postpone some bills this past session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| they lie over to this coming session because it's a two-year legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| So really nothing's ever over until the two years are over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| But now we'll have 2,000 new bills that will be introduced beginning in January, just about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| But I just want to say congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| I think I've expressed that to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| I am very, very grateful for the opportunity to be a part of your team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| and look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Any other questions for Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=818)|

| 0:14:30| to be located at 2205 Village Placeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=873)|

| 0:14:37| Thank you very much, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I thought a moment's explanation about this item and the very next item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| and about our Affordable Rental Development Fund might be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=883)|

| 0:14:53| I'm Becky Wade, Director of Community Development for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=893)|

| 0:15:05| that are going to be funded with the new Affordable Rental Development Fund that was established in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| These are local dollars totaling $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| and they were set out to help support and incentivize the development of affordable rental units in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=916)|

| 0:15:30| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| I'm very excited about this, the first use of the affordable monies coming into the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| And I was wondering if, Daniel, if you wouldn't mind from the Restoration House telling us about your facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| This is Daniel Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Thank you, Councilwoman Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| It's an honor to be with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| It's so good to have you out the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Some of you all may have some vague familiarity with the Restoration House because of Extreme Makeover Home Edition back in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| when the City of Knoxville blessed my family with a new home and a duplex for our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| And I'm thrilled to let you all know through that project the six acres next door shortly after that became available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| and the Restoration House was able to purchase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| And we've slowly been developing that into a 24-unit development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| including a community center for low-income single mothers and their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| It's a transitional program that we have tremendous success in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| We have about a 75% graduation rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Over seven years, 100% of our graduates were still working, even seven years removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| and 90% were not working when they moved into the Restoration House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Also, 88% of all of our families who graduate Restoration House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| are able to meet all their housing and food needs with no government assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| And so we're able to take the dollars that are being provided through the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| to help families actually get off assistance long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| So it's an honor to be considered for these funds, and we will put them to tremendous use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Yeah, I just had a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| So are you at 24 units now, or is that your goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| We currently, on this site, it's a six-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| We have a community center that's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| The playground and six units have been operating since 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| In July of this year, we started construction on 12 more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| These funds would actually finish the funding for those 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| They're scheduled to be open in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| and then we will move immediately into constructing the last six, which will be at 24 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1064)|

| 0:17:47| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| with Helen Ross McNabb Center, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| to award $300,000 from the Affordable Rental Development Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| for the development of 10 affordable housing units for homeless veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| to be located at 3720 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1080)|

| 0:18:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Councilwoman, St. Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| I'm very glad that Becky Wade had a chance to talk about the affordable housing funds that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| I went out to this site also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| and I was a bit disappointed because there was already a facility there that's being torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| I think this is a very costly project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| I think the purpose of it is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Housing for mentally ill veterans and the location of it is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| I would like to see in the future it be considered different avenues of using the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| maybe in some sort of cooperative housing, some other options that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| But otherwise, I approve of this housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| Would you like to hear from Jerry Wagner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Houston Smeltzer and Jerry Wagner from McNabb are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| and they might be able to address why they decided to tear that building down and build again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| Thank you, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| Jerry Wagner with the Helen Ross McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| and we're very grateful for the opportunity to serve the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| The building that we did tear down and demolition would have cost us more than new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| That was the essential decision point for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| It's already an expensive project, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| It's about $1.7 million to put it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| But it's a high calling for us to serve these veterans and provide an opportunity for them to have permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| And for us, at that location, if you haven't been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| we have on site an outpatient mental health clinic specifically designed for veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| Those are the folks who come and get care there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| So we have the opportunity to wrap around services on site, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| So it's kind of like independent housing plus, and we think that's a really good value for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| So I hope that answers your question, and I know that you came out to visit at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| But our actual costs per unit are actually quite reasonable for construction in this day and age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| and we've had those costs vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| One of the things when I had asked you about keeping the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| and you said the residence that was already there, that it would cost more to rehab it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| Then when I asked about how expensive it was going to be to rebuild something there, you pointed me to labor costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| So it seems, you know, it ends up being $300 a square foot for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1233)|
| 0:20:41| For that, we could have done something, we could place them downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| So that's what I'm disappointed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Why I'm excited about moving this forward is the $800,000 that's coming from the state, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| If we don't fill that gap in funding right now, that evaporates, and then there is no housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| and we definitely need that housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| So thank you for moving this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| And I would only point out that the $300,000 that's being recommended represents less than 18% of the total project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1266)|
| 0:21:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1275)|

| 0:22:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Once again, I would like to ask Jim Hagerman to talk just a moment about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| We've had a lot of work done out there, and this, I think, will add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| So, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Jim Hagerman, engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| This project was originally driven by the lack of pedestrian facilities at this intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1345)|
| 0:22:36| and the department saw the opportunity to reconfigure the realign the lanes so that there could be some more efficient operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1356)|
| 0:22:51| and squeeze in the pedestrian facilities without having any net impact on traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1371)|
| 0:22:59| So, it will have crosswalks, pedestrian signals, mid-street refuge, if you can't get it all the way across all those lanes at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1379)|
| 0:23:15| some additional sidewalks, and bus stop facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| So, we're now to the construction part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| You've seen it several times before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| I'd also mention the funding mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| Funding mix is based on a grant from the state specifically for multimodal projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1407)|
| 0:23:39| and also a significant amount of local money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1425)|

| 0:24:11| I just wanted to say how excited I am to see this planning project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| Is that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Yeah, just talk right into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| We'll give this a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| I just wanted to say how excited I am to see the phase one of this planning project moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Not only is this a good project for South Knoxville and the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| but I think the urban wilderness has really set our city apart overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| I'm particularly excited about the stakeholder engagement experience that Vaughn & Melton demonstrated in their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1477)|
| 0:24:45| And really interested in moving that forward with some of our neighborhood and other stakeholder groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| So I don't know if Mr. Hagerman or Mr. Brace want to say anything, but I'm very excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| I can just say that I'm also very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| It will be a transformative thing for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1503)|

| 0:26:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| I just want to ask Ann to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| We talked about it this week and I needed a reminder of where we were on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| and where we're trying to head and give us an update on how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Ann Wallace, Deputy Director for the Office of Redevelopment, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| Good evening, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| It's a pleasure to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| The sanitary laundry building was a property that the city inherited from a tax sale foreclosure in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1607)|
| 0:26:56| The previous property owner was delinquent in his taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| and unfortunately had also been delinquent in his agreement with the Tennessee Department of Environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| and Conservation for cleanup work at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| With that said, the building unfortunately had not been maintained since 1993| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| when the sanitary laundry shuttered its doors and was no longer in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| Therefore, we ended up in a situation where the roof was in substantial disrepair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| partially because of the number of openings that were required for venting as part of the laundry process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| but also just from a general lack of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| With that said, when we went forward with our contract for the replacement and repair of the roof structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| we acknowledged that there was likely going to be some additional costs assumed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| just given the age of the structure and the unknowns when pulling a roof of that age apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| What we found was with the requirements to add eight inches of insulation to the lower portion of the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| that raised the sill height enough that the clear story windows in the middle of the roof section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| would be lower than is necessary to provide the proper flashing so that we can warranty the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| With that said, we also have a cleanup grant from the Environmental Protection Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| in the amount of $240,000 to address the environmental concerns for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| In total, with this amendment, we're spending somewhere in the neighborhood of about $700,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| to get this building back into productive reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| I think ultimately our goal is once we finish the cleanup grant that ends in September of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| when we put the property out for request for proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| we would like to try and get a majority of those funds back through the disposal of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you, Anne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Are there any uses that it's going to be prohibited for that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| We have a draft voluntary brownfield agreement with the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| They are very excited to see that we are giving this property the appropriate attention that it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| and deserves as a potential historic resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| and given its location at the intersection of Central and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| But the short answer to your question is it will likely be additional cleanup required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| if someone wanted to use the property for a residential use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| and that would go above and beyond the scope of work that we're even putting the money in for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| It would be available for use as a commercial structure or a light manufacturing or office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| but for folks to live there full time, for that to be a resident structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| it would require additional cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| So we'll have about $700,000 in it, plus the $200,000 that comes in a federal grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| So there will be close to $1 million spent on the property to go back on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| And we think we're going to put out those RFPs into 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Our federal grant with EPA requires us to maintain ownership of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| until we conclude the cleanup process, which is scheduled to end in September of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| So it will be structurally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Is that the point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| And it will have a new roof on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| At the end of our $700,000, we'll have it structurally sound, and it will have a new roof on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| And then you've done enough environmental cleanup that it would allow for light manufacturing or office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| Or commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Or commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Another factor to keep in mind is that if we were to continue to sit on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| and not address the roof, it would ultimately need to be demolished by neglect, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| And the cost of demoing that property and addressing the environmental contaminants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| that are held underground, since we would probably be taking the full structure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| would be comparable to what we're spending to address the roof and the environmental conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| And at the end of the day, we'll have a 30,000-square-foot building that can be reused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Well, Councilman Wallace asked some of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| So I appreciate you guys getting this blighted and vacant property and working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| because it's been much discussion in the 4th District, which is a couple of steps away from where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| So in the annual, I've spent about $900,000 on getting it stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| Did you have a pre-construction appraisal before the work started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| Absolutely, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| We actually asked a general contractor to come in and look at simply the roof repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| and they estimated $800,000 for the roof repair and for the structural design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| that would be necessary to address the clear spans and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| No, I mean when it goes out for RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Did we do some kind of appraisal of what we anticipated would be valued on the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Not specifically, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| And I think one of the keys to that is that the neighborhood is also in transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| and we're already seeing additional investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| You may be familiar with the Elkmont Exchange that's just up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Obviously, the facade program under the community development direction of then-Mayor Rojero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| did some investment at that corner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| So we're starting to see a lot more demand for properties in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| and I think even as we move 18 months from now, we'll see even more when we get ready to go out on an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| But it's a little bit of a hit and miss in how much money do we want to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| trying to play what the market will be in a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| So when it goes out for RFP, it won't have a price tag associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| It's really what people offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| We have the opportunity to condition the site, to include the cost, to try and recoup them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| We have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Now, that may limit interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| So at that time, we will certainly go through city administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| and work on whether or not we want to condition the property to include a certain price tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| Okay, and if someone wants to purchase it and do the extra work to make it residential, they have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| It's something that we could approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| And that's included in the voluntary brownfield agreement with TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| All right, thank you, Anne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| with Rogers Petroleum Incorporated for the provision of bulk fuels for vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| and equipment managed by the Fleet Services Department and the Knoxville Area Transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| for an initial term of six months at an estimated cost per term of $1,653,895.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2006)|
| 0:33:34| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| I see Mr. York here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| If you could come explain, it looks like we're changing the way we buy fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| and I was just sort of wondering what this was brought on by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| and if this will assist in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| I know that's one of the challenges every year is trying to figure out how much fuel will be in the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| This is the procedure we have used for the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| What we have is we go out on a six-month contract with a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| We agree to pay what we call OPUS Plus, and OPUS is the Oil Pricing Information System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| And what that does is that gives us the market values of fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2062)|
| 0:34:31| and for the premium we pay, we are guaranteed expedited delivery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| and we are first in line in the cases of shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| In terms of helping with the budget, we will still end up having to do the same procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| because this is not a fixed price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| It floats with the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| and we have to continue to do our estimates on what we think oil will price out over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2093)|
| 0:35:02| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| All right, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| 11K as a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Hill Avenue Partners, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2113)|

| 0:37:43| So, the increase in backdoor garbage collection, is that just for our older citizens, or does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| that include some of the areas that we ended up having more residential areas have alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2269)|

| 0:37:57| Yeah, Chad Weth, Public Service Director of City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| What you see here is just for backdoor garbage collection, which is just for residents 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2281)|

| 0:38:21| And before we take the vote on this, we do want to recognize our new Solid Waste Manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Patience Melnick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2306)|

| 0:38:44| Will there be any change in service in Fort Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| Is this just documenting the service that's currently being provided and including that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| in the contract, or is this a change in service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2333)|

| 0:38:59| Obviously, there's a massive amount of people that come to a very small area, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| quickly realized that the contents of cart system struggles a little bit after a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2344)|

| 0:39:10| It does not change the service quality or anything related to every other week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2350)|

| 0:40:40| The majority of us know the first nine words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| Right now, about two blocks down from here, are some of the huddled masses of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| That huddled mass is our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| They are aged-out youths from foster care, our veterans, families, and to our great shame and chagrin, our elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2457)|
| 0:41:06| Yes, our elderly, our most prized libraries and shoulders living on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| Our biennial plan about the homeless is due to be released next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| The plan from two years ago revealed that over 2,600 known homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| As we await the new numbers, we can already see with our eyes that there's been change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| But to what good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| The 2014 Homelessness Report and subsequent Mayor's Roundtable speaks of leadership, collaboration, and civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2491)|
| 0:41:39| Five goals were set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| Three goals we are failing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| We are failing in leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| We are failing in access and variety of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| And we have failed in increase in economic opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| The day camp that was established, while great in theory, has done nothing but move the people from one major street to a side street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2514)|
| 0:42:05| Once the day ends, the people go back to where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| This begs the question, what has the $500,000 spent to date done to improve the lives of the homeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| The Roundtable has many organizations seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| However, the faith-based organizations must be invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| And there should be community advocates invited to join this important group of change agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| I stand here tonight and desire to be seated so there can be a reconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| You see, the Roundtable and the Homeless Plan have had a disconnect from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2556)|
| 0:42:44| There are no recent quarterly reports posted on the webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Indeed, the planning has not advanced quickly enough to process over the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| The very core of this and all programs that serve people is accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| The political will of the people is to help the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| The public cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| They have been calling and emailing me, and I believe they've been reaching out to you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2588)|
| 0:43:16| I came not only to have a seat at the table, but to ask you, our council members, which of you will be our gatekeepers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2596)|
| 0:43:25| You are assigning committees and positioning people to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Just as it is for all of us, James 414 says our lives here are a vapor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2609)|
| 0:43:37| And the word asks you, what is your purpose in this brief time that you are here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| And so it is with your brief time on this council, what shall be your legacy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| We, the people, choose to make the priority of 2018 the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| We have strategic plans and ideas to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| We choose to help our tired, our poor, and our huddled masses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2637)|

| 0:44:05| We have already received the greatest gift ever given in the history of mankind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| and now we need the gift of hope to be given to our homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| We are greater together, and we must begin boldly to walk together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Business as usual can be, cannot be, and will be no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| The second person is Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set your timer for up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| My name is Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| I live at 558 Milton Drive in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| The most interesting thing about me is who I'm married to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I'm married to an Knoxville police officer, and by virtue of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| I get to be friends with a lot of cops, and I get to see their social media feeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| I get to hang out with them at house parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| I get to hear what's going on in their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| and I think the city is approaching a tipping point in the police department that I'm not sure everybody's aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| First, I'd just like to point out a few good things that this police department is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| Diversity recruitment has been phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I see a lot of female police officers, a lot of racial minority police officers being integrated and recruited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2710)|
| 0:45:19| I think we're doing a great job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| The outreach has been awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| In our mental health crisis, we have a crisis intervention team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| I think they're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| I think we're kind of leading almost the nation in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| Where we're not doing such a great job is staffing levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| I think we're approaching a point where we're going to start seeing where we don't have enough officers to cover the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2739)|
| 0:45:48| and I think that needs to be addressed quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| Just a few causes of this or why I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| Call volume seems to be too heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| I see a lot of mandatory overtime being implemented, especially going from night shift to the overnight shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| I see a lot of voluntary overtime being offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| I think this is due, one, squads aren't being fully staffed, so we can't address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| We're getting the high-level crimes, so break-ins, theft, car accidents, we're addressing those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| but we're having hour wait times for alarm calls or calls for service in neighborhoods of a suspicious person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2783)|
| 0:46:32| And then, of course, the opioid epidemic is hitting us pretty hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| We've got a lot of overdose calls, and cops are generally first to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| We have around 20 officers, patrol officers, that they can walk in tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| hand in their gun and their badge, and be out the door for retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| If that happened all in one day, we would be hurt and bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| We did just go through an academy, so we've got some officers on deck to be operating independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| but I still don't think those are going to cover us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| I think the primary driver why we see high turnover, why we see officers leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| is our pay and benefits package is pretty abysmal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| My wife really, really likes being a cop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| It's what she's wanted to be since she was a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| But if she wasn't married to me, and I have an income, so we're a dual-income household,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| there's no way she could afford a mortgage and a car payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| We don't have kids, but she certainly couldn't raise a kid on her salary alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| So I see a lot of one-income officer households that are having to get a roommate or rent out a room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2851)|
| 0:47:41| and that's just not really sustainable in the long term for a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| So those are the problems. Here's some solutions I'd like to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| Currently you authorize 416 uniformed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| If we compare ourselves to Chattanooga, who has roughly the same population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| they're at around 500 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| I think we need to be at that level given our population and our population distribution geographically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| So bump us up from 416 to 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| I don't think the police department is seeing a lot of involvement from the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| so I would encourage you guys to go on some ride-alongs, attend graduation functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| I think that would go a long way to see what's going on at the patrol level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2902)|
| 0:48:31| I'd like to see you guys request a report examining our staffing levels and our police officer turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| I believe this is something the police department can provide for you rather quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| and it would give you not just my opinion but some actual data to work from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| And then, as I mentioned, I think you need to raise wages and benefits for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| This would benefit me personally, so don't take my word for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| but I would encourage you to compare our salaries to surrounding major city police departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| Chattanooga, Asheville, Johnson City, Lexington, and Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| We are behind all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| And with the proximity to DOE security contractors here, it's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| If you've got a family to take care of and you're a police officer in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| you're probably going to move somewhere very close by that's going to provide you about double the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Okay, council, that is the end of public forum, and there's no further business, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171219?start=2969)|
