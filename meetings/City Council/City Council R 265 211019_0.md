| 0:11:24| 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an interlocal project agreement with Knox County for the planning and development of an urgent care behavioral health facility at 1515 St. Mary Street on the historic St. Mary's campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=684)|

| 0:11:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Council, I just wanted to give a little context for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| It's not a new topic, but this interlocal project agreement is, and I want to thank you for your initial support for this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| This, if approved, would convert the former Tenova Surgery Center building at the historic St. Mary's campus to an urgent care behavioral health facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=714)|
| 0:12:04| And this interlocal agreement is a key piece of the partnership to make this possible, an instrument that allows the city and the county to jointly own the building as we continue to plan out the details of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=724)|
| 0:12:16| Closing on the building is slated for November 3rd, per the sale and ground lease termination agreement you approved earlier this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| I also just as part of this, I want to mention that I went to Nashville last week and met with Governor Lee along with Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=742)|
| 0:12:32| Deputy David Brace joined me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Chris Caldwell was there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| And I think also, really importantly, all three leaders of our hospital systems were there, along with Gary Vanier from Helen Ross McNabb, talking to the governor about this plan and seeking the state support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=757)|
| 0:12:53| My initial impressions is that it was very, it was well received and they're interested in helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| So I'm really excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| One way we're describing it is a hospital emergency room diversion program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| Our BHUC is a jail diversion and this is to divert people who are having mental health crises to get help right away, which is much easier in a behavioral health specialized place, rather than an emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=787)|
| 0:13:22| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Yep, that's all the stuff that I wanted to share with you at the moment about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| So Councilmember Smith, you had your light on first and then we'll go to Councilmember Parker and Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| You answered a couple of my questions, but I have one remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| It was around capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Deputy Brace, can you speak to what the ideal capacity is or projected size of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| How many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Yeah, so the building itself is about 25,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| It's the old surgery center for Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| So it's a building built in the late 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| It's in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| So the capacity we're still working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| So there's really two capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| The urgent care capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| So folks that would come in from the neighborhood that may have a bump or a scrape or a fever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| And then there is the capacity for the behavioral health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| And that's anywhere from 20 to 40 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| And, again, Mr. Bagneer and the folks with Helen Ross McNabb are working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| I don't have that document directly in front of me, but can get you the original number, the number that we propose to the state at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=856)|
| 0:14:26| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Do we already have a sense of how this new center would be operated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| Who would be in charge of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| So we would look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| The interlocal agreement is for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| And actually the county commission passed it yesterday to own the building together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| We are still working through who would run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| There's really two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| There is the urgent care, which is the medical first floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| And then there's the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| We've been working with McNabb on that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Again, very similar to the jail diversion program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| This is a program to get people out of the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Oftentimes folks who are in crises will sit in an emergency room one to six days waiting on services at a very high cost to the hospitals and to TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=906)|
| 0:15:18| And so we believe McNabb will be the partner that will run this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| And then a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| Well, actually, let me make a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| I'm interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| I'm very excited about this initiative and anxious to hear more details as they develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=932)|
| 0:15:43| My concern as things move forward is ensuring that this is an opportunity for folks to receive care and treatment and that there's no association to the police department right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=943)|
| 0:16:04| That's my major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Because we're not getting many details, and I understand the city and county are working to jump at an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| But without those details, I'm hesitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Just one thing, my expectation for this, unlike the BHUC, which is for people who would otherwise be going to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=977)|
| 0:16:26| this would be a place where people in the community who have not had any encounters with law enforcement at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| they or a family member or loved one or neighbor are having some kind of mental health crisis, and they need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| And they can get better help here than they could at a long wait at an emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| So it's a clear space for emergency departments, and it doesn't require any intervention by law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| So that is my expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| That is what we're working on, and that is what it could be if it moves forward and gets staffed and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| But this is a first step, and getting the city and the county to invest in this collectively I think is a real positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| I think the only association with the police department is it happens to be next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| It's a fully separate building with its own parking lot, but there's been no discussion about an association with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| It would be nonprofits and some sort of organization to run the urgent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| We would need to work with legal, city, and county to set those entities up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| But that's the only association that happens to be the opportunity on historic St. Mary's Beach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| I appreciate that clarification and that commitment that's being made to ensure that this is an opportunity to address those needs in our community in a proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1055)|
| 0:17:49| And I'm looking forward to seeing what's moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| So I wanted to point out a couple of things that are here in the contract that we're looking at and ask a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1077)|
| 0:18:06| Sorry, the interlocal agreement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| So we previously in a previous meeting agreed to the purchase price to buy out the former lease for the former owner or lease occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1090)|
| 0:18:20| But the county will be reimbursing the city 50% of that that we've already agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| What you agreed to was purchase and termination of the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| We own the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| It was a ground lease, many-year ground lease with a group, Lilla Bridge, that then leased it to Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| And so what is the timeframe for the rest of their lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| I think that's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| So we closed November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| They have asked for an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| I'm looking for Mark Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Wave at me, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| He was here, I think, through March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| And the longer they occupy the building, it's good for us because we're still putting together the plans for working with the state on funding and putting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1139)|
| 0:19:09| There's quite a bit of work to go into creating the entities, getting the building gutted and built out for these uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1149)|
| 0:19:18| So the longer they're in the building, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| We've also approached PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Ms. Burt is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| The city and the county would engage with them to just manage the building, keep it secure, keep the lights on while we are planning and working with our partners on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1164)|
| 0:19:34| So the lease will be up very soon in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| PBA would manage the building while we own it jointly until we can put all the pieces together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| So our timeframes for something on the city-county partnership side, the earliest would be potentially late 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1183)|
| 0:19:52| So the city and the county will own this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Well, the city will own it November 3rd, assuming there's approval of this interlocal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| We will own it jointly upon closing, and they will pay us back for half of those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| So we'll own it November 3rd, assuming approval, 18 to 24 months to actually get this turnkeyed and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1208)|
| 0:20:16| So we'll own it jointly during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| What it looks like in the future, we're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| I think Mr. Swanson and his team and Mr. Mamentoff and the lawyers over in the county will work through what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| It is probably two separate agreements or a master agreement with a sublease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| That will be worked out, and it will take a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| We'll bring it back before council anticipates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| And to clarify, is there anyone here from Helen Ross McNabb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| Are we not that far in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| They are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| We're still early enough in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| I told Mr. Smelter I didn't think we'd need him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| So let me just ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Let's see if we can answer this and maybe cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| So when the mayor mentions meeting with the governor and talking about, you know, waits at emergency rooms and how that's paid for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1257)|
| 0:21:07| you mentioned figuring out what role the state's going to play in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| Is the state going to play some role in paying for indigent care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Is it Blue Cross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| I mean, is it TennCare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Well, I'll tell you, the two other people who attended this meeting were the commissioner of mental health, Maria Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| and the director of TennCare, Stephen Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| So those are the discussions we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Okay, is how to pay for. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| That's what we're asking them to help with because the city can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Because one of the important things for people to understand is in the state of Tennessee, we are potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| and particularly in this area, we are a poor payer mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| And that means that we have a lot of people who are indigent without any coverage, a lot, a larger amount than many other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1307)|
| 0:21:55| We have a considerable number of people on TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| And then we have people with private insurance, like many of us who have employers that give us private insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| or someone who gets insurance through the open marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| But we have a considerable number of people with no coverage, and that is why they don't seek care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| or when they seek care, the needs are at a greater expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| So it's a cost burden on providing care, and it's an impediment to why people don't get care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1339)|
| 0:22:27| So that's important for us to understand when we get on that pathway how things are going to get paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| and who's covering it and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| It's one of the reasons that the previous hospital left this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| is because they were providing a lot of the indigent care in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| and they went to a different area of town so they could seek more people with better insurance and less indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1366)|
| 0:22:55| So anyway, it's an issue that we have here, and I'll take the opportunity to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| we haven't taken the Medicaid expansion in the state, and it's a setback for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| So the last question I'll ask, well, I can't remember what my question was going to be, so I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1385)|
| 0:23:16| So timeframe is 18 to 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| The county is going to reimburse us for 50 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| and we're still figuring out the cost coverage mix for how things are going to be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| Oh, I remember my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| This will also be a new tool in the toolbox for our social workers, co-responder team that is going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| Is that a fair interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Yeah, when it opens, it will be a resource to anybody who is helping someone in a mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Thank you, Mayor, and this is really good news to hear that these conversations are going on at this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| I do want to maybe caution us not to 100 percent say that law enforcement may not play a part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| because we do know that there are some instances where family members may have someone at home experiencing a mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| Even with a mobile crisis, the police could be called, and this facility could be a resource for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| and the police may be the ones to have to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| I didn't mean to preclude that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| I just meant that you didn't have to be brought there by law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| And it's a very central location, so it could be that, as you said and as Councilmember Ryder said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| that could be something that law enforcement, including people outside the city of Knoxville, bring people to, as well as the BHU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1476)|
| 0:24:44| So more capacity is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| We have great needs in mental health, so I think if we can make this happen, it will be a real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| Yeah, I'm hopeful that there's some way that we maybe could get even more beds out of this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| I don't know if that's possible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| You know, 20 to 40 is not the largest number, but, again, it's more than what we have available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| So I'm just very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| If you guys will just please keep us posted on the progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Councilmember Huggett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| I, too, think this is a wonderful opportunity that we don't want to miss, and so we definitely want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| There are lots of details to be worked out, but we can't miss the opportunity to approve this interlocal agreement to start the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1525)|
| 0:25:34| But, Deputy Mayor Brace, my question for you is, when you're talking about the lease, they want a lease extension to March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1534)|
| 0:25:45| What is the lease payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| I have to look back at Mr. Mamentoff, who has been negotiating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| It would maintain the existing lease payment, correct, Mark, that they are paying to Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| They wanted less of the building, and what we said was, if you want to stay in, you need to keep managing the entire building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Mark, is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| Mr. Mamentoff, if you could just state your name and address and tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| I certainly agree with what Mr. Brace is saying, that that certainly is our expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| And I think they will agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| Their lease payment is tied to the financing, though, of the project, and so that financing ends next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| And so I'm sure they're going to say, wait a minute, I paid for the entire building, so we're going to have to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| I did not mean to open this whole can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| My question is, they will pay us something if they stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| We are not giving it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| So my point I'm trying to make is that letting them stay and paying us for as long as it takes before we need it is a very prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1607)|
| 0:26:59| And if it takes us 18 to 24 months, if they want to stay longer, I assume you might be amenable to that if you don't need it to start knocking down walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1619)|
| 0:27:09| I would do that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| So I think that I guess what I'm saying is I support you extending the lease for a lease payment for whatever is reasonable before we actually need the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1632)|
| 0:27:22| And it certainly is good to have the occupancy in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| And an occupied building is better than an unoccupied building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Council Member Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| So one last question to tack on to what Councilwoman Fugitt just asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| I don't know if Mr. Mametoff needs to be involved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Are there efforts to encourage them to stay longer because unoccupied and vacant buildings are really, really not a fun thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1662)|
| 0:27:53| I don't think they're going to stay as long as they need the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| And I think they're getting very close to not wanting to be in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| They just need a few more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| If they came to us and said, can we get more time, we are totally open to that until we get the design work done and construction underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Because they already have a place they're moving to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| It's not a surgery center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| They have some info systems folks utilizing that as office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| They need to clear some of that equipment out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| They need a few more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| I don't anticipate it going much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| But as Councilwoman Fugitt indicated, it would be great if they did and paid us some money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Do we have anyone else we could put in the building for 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| Well, I think you've got to remember that hopefully in about six months, assuming that Council agrees with this interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| we would be designing and under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| So we're going to gut the building and do a construction build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| And that is part of what we presented to the state was assistance on the Capitol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| I really appreciate all the questions that my colleagues have asked about this and the encouragement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| This is really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| As we all know, we've had discussions about behavioral needs and urgent care for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| This is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| We get it established maybe, and then we can expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I'm also encouraged by the connection and relationship that we're exploring with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| And as we've just talked about before, I would like to see the state give us a little bit more of a hand with some of our homeless issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| and mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| So this is a very good step in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| and I look forward to seeing it progress and helping out in any way I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1784)|

| 0:29:50| 11B is the resolution endorsing a Vision Zero goal to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries on Knoxville streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| and endorsing engagement of a working group of partners to develop a Vision Zero action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| that advances this goal through engineering, education, and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Motion made to approve and second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Councilmembers, we have two people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| First is Caroline Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| You can come to the podium and state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1814)|
| 0:30:26| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Caroline Cooley, 903 Wingate Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| I'm the president of BikeWalk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| On behalf of BikeWalk Knoxville, BikeWalk Knoxville is a committee of BikeWalk Tennessee and was founded in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1838)|
| 0:30:47| Our mission, BikeWalk Knoxville works to make the Knoxville region a better place to bike and walk for people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1847)|
| 0:30:59| In 2014, BikeWalk Knoxville worked with the City Council and Knoxville City Administration to create a complete streets ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1859)|
| 0:31:08| with the underlying goal of safe access for all roadway users of all transportation modes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1868)|
| 0:31:16| We believe that safe streets for all can only be accomplished by prioritizing human life in our transportation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| and we see Vision Zero as the next step in achieving this goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| Brian Hill, BikeWalk Knoxville's Vision Zero committee chair, will now speak about the importance of Vision Zero in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Mr. Hill has also signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| If you could state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes if you could start the clock just in case he needs all five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you, Mayor Kaganan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Brian Hill, 512 East Oak Hill, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Vision Zero, this could not be passed by you all in a more timely instance in our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1915)|
| 0:32:04| In the state of Tennessee, there are over 1,000 roadway deaths per year due to street violence and roadway violence in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| This last year, we had one of our worst years on record for traffic violence, deaths, and serious injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1931)|
| 0:32:19| In our city, as in elsewhere throughout the state, the vulnerable are the most at risk, the elderly, children, those with mobility challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1939)|
| 0:32:29| and this is the time to really face this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| I'm going to say that we are fortunate as a community here in Knoxville because the TPO has already laid a lot of groundwork for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| in terms of outlining where the traffic injuries and fatalities are occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| what the circumstances of those traffic fatalities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| and even coming up with some investments and policy solutions that we can use as a framework to start hitting the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| So we really can move on this a lot more easily than a lot of other communities can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| I want to stress that this is not political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| Whether you're conservative, whether you're liberal, whatever your affiliation is, we all care about human life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| and we can all understand the importance of prioritizing human life over other considerations on a daily basis as we operate in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=1992)|
| 0:33:21| I want to state that Vision Zero is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| This is not like any other traffic safety campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Vision Zero came to the United States in 2014, and since then, in many communities that it has taken place in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| including New York City, San Francisco, they've seen decreases in fatalities and serious injuries of up to 30% in just five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2015)|
| 0:33:44| So this is a really impactful movement, and that's because it's collaborative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| It doesn't say we're just going to make one group safer or another group safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| It says we're all going to come together and prioritize humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Humans are the focus. People are the focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| It's not any one mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| It's also different because it sets a goal of zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| We're not saying we're going to reduce the number of traffic fatalities and serious injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| We're going to take those down to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| And so any policy or investment that council votes to create or that the administration is able to administer can be measured against that goal of zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2049)|
| 0:34:22| Vision Zero has been circulated in the community by BikeWalk Knoxville over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| We've had a petition going over the last several months, and we've actually gained over 600 signatories on this petition endorsing a specific Vision Zero Knoxville campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2069)|
| 0:34:39| So there's a lot of momentum behind this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| This resolution that is before you tonight will really pave the way for us to make a real difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| It will pave the way for us to establish a working group that can not only create a Vision Zero action plan that lays out the steps to get us to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| but will also help keep us accountable as we take the steps needed to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| And I want to take a moment to celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| As was mentioned earlier, we need to celebrate what a great city we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| This Vision Zero resolution really does put us on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| If adopted, we'll make Knoxville the second city in the state of Tennessee to take on Vision Zero as a priority, zero deaths and serious injuries as a priority on its roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2113)|
| 0:35:28| We also have the opportunity to become the first Vision Zero city recognized by the Vision Zero network on their map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| The other city, Nashville, that has declared that they are going after a Vision Zero campaign, they are in the process of developing their action plan and working group as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2137)|
| 0:35:48| So we will be working and have a lot of opportunities to learn from each other in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| I also want to say, most importantly, this gives us the opportunity to decrease traffic violence, to save lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2153)|
| 0:36:03| As somebody with personal experience with a collision with a car on a bicycle that nearly took my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and your ability to be forward thinking and vote on this important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2170)|
| 0:36:20| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| I just wanted to thank Bike Walk Knoxville and Mr. Hill, who I know has put a lot of time into this as well, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| This group has worked very hard to further this, and I have been talking with them for a couple of years about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| I appreciate the mayor for putting this forward and supporting it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| A lot of our infrastructure is done from the perspective of vehicle traffic, automobiles, and there's a lot of opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2208)|
| 0:36:58| And people who walk and bike pay taxes, too, so it makes sense that we have infrastructure that makes all modes of transportation possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| My son is now taken to riding his bike to school every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| That's possible. He does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| And so I want to make sure that it's safe for people like him, adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| There are people who can't get driver's licenses for different reasons or can't drive a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| so we should make transportation available to all people like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| I also want to comment, I think two times in the last 24 hours, I know last night on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| I'm happy that I was very much paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| I had somebody cross Kingston Pike in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| They were, like, stuck in the middle of the road, and so I had to stop in Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| near campus, between Sequoia and campus, to let them cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| We just have a lot of opportunities to improve, to educate pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| but provide opportunities for them to be able to get around and move within our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| It should be not the abnormal for people to want to get around by bike or by walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2282)|
| 0:38:11| It should be the normal, and we should make it safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and we should do all of our infrastructure with that in mind as best as we can do within our means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| So I appreciate that and look forward to seeing how this progresses with the working group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| One thing I wanted to point out or highlight in this discussion is I want to ensure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2313)|
| 0:38:46| in our resolution, it says that Vision Zero will prioritize equitable treatment of all citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2326)|
| 0:38:56| and include input from low-income communities, communities of color, and community leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| in the development and implementation of plans and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| And just one thing I wanted to note was that I've seen and heard a lot of reports of unhoused folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2348)|
| 0:39:19| who have been injured or killed in the past year or two from traffic-related accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2359)|
| 0:39:28| And so I just want to challenge this group to expand the work of the working group to include no-income folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2368)|
| 0:39:38| because we have a lot of unhoused folks who need safer places, need safer ways to get around our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2378)|
| 0:39:48| And also that might need to include looking at the problem from different angles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| not just individuals trying to move from point A to point B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| but are there substance use issues related to traffic incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| and do we need to pay attention as a city to other interventions that can help in addition to the bike infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| and the traditional things we think of when we think of pedestrian safety and bike safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| That's just one thing I wanted to lift up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I do support this initiative and have, you know, lived in a city where I was able to ride my bike everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2424)|
| 0:40:33| and I loved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| And I know I've made this argument before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| We're far from having the infrastructure that the Netherlands has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| I don't think that we should, you know, I'm trusting your leadership with setting the goal at zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2441)|
| 0:40:52| because I know that's a hard goal to reach, and so I don't want us to feel like we're failing the goal each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| but we need to work towards it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| So I support this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| I do hope that we can expand the way that we approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you, Councilmember Parker, Councilmember Roberto, and then Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| I just want to congratulate everybody who's worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| Bike Walk Knoxville, this is a fantastic program, Vision Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| I'm very supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| I just wanted to be added as a sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Just to all the folks out there that are concerned about traffic calming, and, of course, we all are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| it's more than just getting people to slow down and speed bumps and speed trailers and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2496)|
| 0:41:44| To get to the root of the problems on traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| we need to really be looking at alternative transportation, get more traffic off the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| and then the people who are using alternative forms of transportation to have safer ways of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| So sometimes I think that these are looked at as separate issues, but they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| They're hand in glove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| So when you think in terms of traffic calming, also think in terms of what Bike Walk Knoxville is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| what the folks that are building greenway trails are doing, what CAT's doing with public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| and I also want to congratulate Bike Walk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| They've really been relentless in their advocacy in a good way, and I appreciate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| and I've personally benefited from some of the improvements they've made in biking and pedestrianism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| I just want to add thanks to council members for bringing this resolution to your meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| Bike Walk Knox, I remember when we met when I was campaigning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| and I signed a pledge that we would bring this forward, and it's taken a little longer than we'd hoped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| but thank you for your patience and perseverance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| I'm really supportive of this Vision Geo resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| As you've heard, it supports all kinds of things that we care about, equity, life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| Life is the main thing, whether you're walking, taking the bus, crossing the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| whether you've been in a car accident, and then we've had incidents of people getting killed car to car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2589)|
| 0:43:17| truck to car, or standing near their car that's broken down with injuries and fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| This doesn't have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| As you know, these are preventable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| and we shouldn't get used to routine fatalities and deaths from these collisions and crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2606)|
| 0:43:35| They can be prevented, and Vision Zero is going to be a great framework to help us get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Also, just to add that it complements the existing efforts of KPD's pedestrian safety awareness work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| It complements the efforts of the Mayor's Climate Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| which has recommended many things related to sustainable, equitable mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| It complements the work of our engineering department, which is designing things for 8 to 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| for our multimodal and our bike-pedestrian infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| and it complements our efforts on traffic calming, which is probably the most popular program the city does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| and we're contemplating adding a significant amount to that later on in the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| So I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| It sounds like there's got a lot of support from Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| and I look forward to convening the working group in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| Are there any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| Council Member Rudd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| I just wanted to tack onto that really quickly, what the Mayor just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| When we're out campaigning and knocking on doors, what I hear from many, many people across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| is they want the ability to be able to walk from their home to get to commercial areas, bus stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| or just literally go around the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| So there is an amazing amount of support out there in the community for the missing links and walkability that is safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2690)|
| 0:44:58| and lots of stories about when their streets are not safe to be able to walk on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| So I think this is important, and people want to be able to walk around, as well as bike and other modes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2703)|
| 0:45:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2715)|

| 0:46:04| It assists with everything from annual physicals and biometric health screenings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| the treatment of work-related injuries, acute care, and proactive health coaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2768)|

| 0:46:17| performing over 1,300 COVID-19 tests on-site with countless more follow-up and screening phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2777)|

| 0:48:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Director Cannon, this is not a got you question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| This is just in response to your message that you sent council about a lot of things that have come before us about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2888)|
| 0:48:17| have had to have contract amendments because of scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| My question is more, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| My question is, should we or are you looking with purchasing about what the scope of work looks like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2906)|
| 0:48:37| This seems to be happening quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| I understand cost overruns because of materials, but these are really more about scope of work, finding things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| I just wondered if there's any thought about how we go about procurement for old things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2929)|
| 0:48:59| My concern is that people may come in with the lowest bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| and then the scope of work might make the project more expensive than if we'd really understood the scope of work before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Director Cannon, Director of Engineering, your question is most appropriate, and that eats at me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| I figured it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Well, and I want to put into context where council has seen most of these overruns recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| in that we've had a number of bridge projects and bridge amendments come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| And the best analogy I can give you, and it's probably lousy, so in advance forgive me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| is frankly your back patio deck at your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| You can have a great coat of paint on it, and then you feel a soft spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| And then you look a little deeper, and that's not just soft, it's rotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| But you pull the board up, and you have no way of knowing this until you pull the board up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| Then you start seeing some of the support structure is rotted as well, and it has taken a lick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| That is the problem in these bridge projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| And that may sound like a dance, but it truly is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Until we get into the project and the contractor can block off lanes and start digging into these areas, we will find more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3013)|
| 0:50:23| The option that you spoke to of doing a lump sum, in fact, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| We try to add a mulligan, if you will, to some of our quantities on unit prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| My personal caution is that going the lump sum route, we are taking all of the risk and putting that on the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| And it is my opinion and the opinion of engineering that that will cost the city much more than if we do this on a lump sum basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3042)|
| 0:50:53| I hope I'm answering your question, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| I mean, it's the difference between cost plus and fixed price and who takes the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| But I wanted this discussed publicly because people have seen for several council meetings that this kind of happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3062)|
| 0:51:11| I think your explanation about home repair at your house, a deck, or whatever is accurate because we all start projects and find things look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3071)|
| 0:51:21| And then they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| If you watch any home improvement show, it happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| So, you know, they always get in there, rot, or there's something's worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| But I appreciate you answering that because I know that that question comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| Why are the overruns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Why aren't we contracting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Why aren't our contracts anticipating that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3107)|

| 0:52:11| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| Yeah, so I don't know if Director Cannon is the right person to ask to explain kind of publicly what exactly this management system does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3134)|
| 0:52:24| I'm going to ask Craig with TPO to come to the microphone if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| I will tell you this is something that we are very excited about and is putting us in a posture very economically to be proactive in our pavement management versus reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3149)|
| 0:52:40| Those are good words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| Okay, we're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Craig Lipke, 1415 Southfield Drive, Knoxville, transportation planner with the TPO in Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| And Harold did strike it exactly, trying to be proactive in maintaining the pavements that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| We have significant investments that we make in federal dollars on our transportation network and sometimes that ongoing maintenance and being most cost effective in keeping our pavements in good condition is something that has not been done in a systematic and data driven way in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3181)|
| 0:53:19| This is something that is a federal focus nationwide and something that the TPO offered to the local agencies throughout the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3199)|
| 0:53:28| Five agencies chose to participate in that process and are moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| The city of Knoxville, including one of them, Knox County, already has a pavement management system that they have recently initiated and we anticipate bringing them into that process moving forward on a recollection of data effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3213)|
| 0:53:47| But it is just an effort to document exactly what you have out there and then there is software and modeling process that takes the treatments that you are projecting out in the region and can project what a given investment dollar figure will result in for your pavement conditions going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3227)|
| 0:54:07| So if you have an X budget and you are going to do Y treatments, what is that going to do going forward with your budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| If you are going to consider a reduction or an increase in that budget, what will be the impact of that on the network conditions going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3254)|
| 0:54:23| So this will enable us to predict and project future costs of paving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| Correct. It can allow you to run modeling scenarios where you can identify if we have a $1 million paving budget for the city or whatever that number is, what will be the result of that investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3269)|
| 0:54:44| You can run scenarios again if say you want to do a 20% increase on that paving budget, what will be the result of pavement conditions from that increase in funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3284)|
| 0:54:55| Or also you can set that to say our pavement condition PCI is kind of the standard term that is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| We have a PCI of 70 on our overall network right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| What if we want to try to achieve getting that up to a 75, what is the investment that it takes to be able to achieve that condition index?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3305)|
| 0:55:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Councilwoman Marauder, may I add just one very brief comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| The city of Knoxville used to be about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| Used to be what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| We used to be about the pavement management program in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| This was when at the time that the budgets were established to pave so many miles, road every year, so that roughly every 20 years everything was resurfaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3329)|
| 0:55:38| As budgets got cut back, that's when that took us to a reactionary effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| Part of that reactionary component was seeing when KUB was going to be putting in utilities so that we would follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3344)|
| 0:55:53| This gets us back to managing it the way that we've always wanted to manage it, but at a significantly less cost than what we have spent in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3353)|
| 0:56:03| Okay. Appreciate the explanation. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3367)|

| 0:57:20| I encourage you to check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| It's a really transformational project and shows your commitment and our commitment to economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3442)|

| 1:06:36| or making motions to include the needs of the people when it comes to the Title VI department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| The current incumbents are running on the slate of progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| yet your progress tends to look like regress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| Presenting resolutions and removing money or presenting resolutions without any committed money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| It's sad to say and see that even the mayor and her cabinet did not take the initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| and earmark money towards reestablishing the Title VI office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| I do believe the reestablishment of the Title VI office could qualify as a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| or initiative with core city priorities under the negative economic impacts of the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| or simply the use of unassigned funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| And please, before you hit me with, well, it's not a capital project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| where there is a will, there is a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| And secondly, there are other questionable projects and initiatives earmarked for funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| such as administrative costs to the tune of $165,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| I remember advocating for an economic disparity study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| yet being told we do not have funding to perform such action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| Yet here we are reallocating funding for an economic impact study for the multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| In 1997, the Title VI office was established with a charge of assuring that equal opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| to share in the generosity of the City of Knoxville contracts was available to African Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| The office, however, failed to realize its potential, knowledgeable and committed directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| sufficient staffing and vital department status to the city's organizational chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| In 2020, the office was closed and has continued to dwindle as a city priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| Currently, the city does a little over 5% with minority businesses and only 1.4% is black businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| This is just one example of why the Title VI office is needed and is a necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| when it comes to making sure there is equitable distribution of city contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| As I mentioned, I can also talk about capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| Other community members and I have also been advocating for Burlington to receive funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| that would help current businesses and bring new businesses to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| so that it too can be thriving, such as a severe avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| Yet, it was shot down on council and here we are again being overlooked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| and not heard in our requests and demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| I do think streetscapes are nice to have, but with a community dealing with poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| violence and lack of resources to grow, investment and development are ways to address the lack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| So when incumbents say they are for progress, and when a mayor and her cabinet say, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| the City of Knoxville realizes focusing on equity is critically important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| to getting different outcomes in our communities, the goal must be beyond closing the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| We must establish appropriate benchmarks that lift up all populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| while paying close attention to those often excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| I am here speaking on behalf of the excluded and we expect your words to be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| and to be followed by actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| And I leave you with this challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| As Brother Umoja said, it is imperative that any funding coming to the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| and especially any additional funding should be thought on how we could utilize this funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| to directly reduce the black poverty rate, how we can utilize funding to invest in the most impoverished communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| and for many people on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| Instead of the multi-use stadium, and when we talk about gentrification is expedited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| we need to make sure we are earmarking funds for the African American Restoration Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| Thank you, Ms. Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on Item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| Just a few points of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| First of all, the Title VI office was not closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| We still operate it just the same as it was under previous administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| Just to clarify on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| We also, you all approved funding for a disparity study, $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| That is in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| The bids are closed and we are reviewing the people who are studying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| who are going to conduct that study and share those conclusions with all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| Also, you have approved the African American Equity Restoration Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| They are still in their preliminary stages of meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| You all allocated $100,000 towards that, of which not a penny has been spent yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| Also, I just want to clarify that you all approved over $2 million to invest in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| That is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Dr. Lomax and Mr. Cannon are teaming up and planning more public input sessions on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| as the money starts to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Those are just a couple of things I wanted to add as points of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| Now, just more general comments on this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| It's a big budget amendment, $35 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| I'm really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| It's a great thing that the federal government has the American Rescue Plan Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| and the FTA dollars are going to help us recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| These are one-time dollars that are here to help us recover from the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| and also help us invest in things that we've had to put off because of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| It reflects many important investments and our top priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| strategically utilizing our first year's worth of the federal relief funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| from the American Rescue Plan and responding in recovery to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| These are going to address many things that we've already been working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| but it's going to give us more resources to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| including the challenges that are particularly acute in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| that have become more acute during the COVID-19 pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| such as mental health, shelter and housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| funding to support and retain our first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| critical infrastructure that we cannot take for granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| There's a lot in here, and I appreciate the time that you all have taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| to go over this with my team and with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| I want to give a special thanks and commendation to Susan Janot and Boyce Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| for all the work the finance team does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Basically, it's a $35 million proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| and that's why we're here to discuss that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| I just want to thank everybody for the work to get to this day so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| We'll start with the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Ms. Parker, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| I have a lot of comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| and so I will respond to some of the points raised during the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4387)|
| 1:13:15| and then I may hold off and share some other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| I appreciate Deputy to the Mayor David Grace and Aaron Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4401)|
| 1:13:32| Director Janot and her staff taking some time to go through this with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4412)|
| 1:13:47| and after an hour of going through it, I realize we need it much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| My first comment is something this substantial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| we need a workshop to go through this fully so we understand all that is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| On County Commission, they have a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| If we had a work session, that could be adequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| but we don't have a work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| and so this is presented to us on a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| We have from Thursday until Tuesday to speak with our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| to read through all of this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| understand that it's just one agenda item of many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| and I don't think that we can do justice to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| and represent their full needs with that limited amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| When I did start doing my research and seeing what other cities had done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| one thing I noticed is that once the federal advisory on this fund was released in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4477)|
| 1:14:46| they started a public input process in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| whether that's through public events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| whether that's through a survey that was sent around to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| but they began the discussion months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| and so I find it very frustrating that we are supposed to have this discussion just tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4501)|
| 1:15:09| and honestly, I would hope that we would postpone so that we can have more time to review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4509)|
| 1:15:20| but I don't expect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| So I will speak to some of the issues raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| I had the same concerns as the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| When I looked around at other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| I saw that other cities had developed economic development initiatives using the ARPA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| As we were going through this long document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| and I was getting a sense of how the funding could be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| and there was discussion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| this gives us an opportunity to spend money on things that we didn't have the budget for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| There are so many expenditures that come to mind that are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4555)|
| 1:16:02| but for me, at the top of that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| is addressing that 42% poverty rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| which is one of the root causes to a lot of the violence that we're seeing in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4569)|
| 1:16:18| It has to be a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| It has to be a top priority of this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| and if we made a commitment to bring in $100 million in 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| and we have $42 million in grant money coming in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| and not a penny of that goes towards that $100 million goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| how can we say that we truly are committed to that goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| $42 million comes in, not a penny goes towards that goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| and yet we want the public to believe that we are committed as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| to bringing in $100 million in grant funding to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| It's unbelievable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| One thing that was raised is that there's $100,000 for the task force now, not a penny spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4624)|
| 1:17:12| One thing I wanted to raise is that we have dedicated $1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| to violence intervention work in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| About $12,000 of that has been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| That's barely a drop in the bucket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| and yet we see a position in this proposal rather than spending down the million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| Last year we dedicated a million to the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| A little over $300,000 was spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| The rest of it expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| It didn't roll over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| So how do we not assume if this million isn't spent, it's not going to roll over as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| So why don't we spend down the million and use this grant on something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| These are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| We have the 100 Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| When we are talking about doing big development projects, big infrastructure upgrades in a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4687)|
| 1:18:15| and the community local businesses are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| we don't have access to capital to keep up with these folks that you're trying to attract into our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| and you say, oh, we have limitations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| We do have limitations, but you know what we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| The 100 Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| We have this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| We have tools, but we have to put money towards them for them to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| We could have a 100 Project just for Burlington area residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| and businesses, so that they are able to have access to capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| as there's so much investment in infrastructure upgrades coming into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| But we have to plan for it, and we have to commit money to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| These are major goals that we have to move forward as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| It can't just be a resolution passed that has no money attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| I'm also ready to have more discussions about the plan for broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4754)|
| 1:19:23| and the energy burden in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| and what are we going to do about households who can't afford the increase in fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| that are being implemented to pay for the fiber install.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| Is this grant an opportunity to have that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| Because we've made a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| Now residents are worried about having higher KUV bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| but we have money flowing in that we're able to use to plan for those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4792)|
| 1:20:01| and ensure that our residents are as protected as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| from what we are experiencing during this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| Economically, health-wise, and otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| I will leave it there because I could go point by point on each of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| but I'm just extremely disappointed that we're not using this as an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| Now if you had committed a million dollars from this, that's what I would like to see now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4827)|
| 1:20:34| But of course if you had done that initially, I would have been like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| just a million dollars? We have a hundred million that we've got to get to in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| But we can't even have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| So now I'm saying can we get something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| Can the city actually commit to the resolution we passed and commit something this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4847)|
| 1:20:56| We have needs that have already been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| Saying that we're waiting on the task force is just stalling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| So we've got to make those commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| That's all I'll say for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| Thank you. Council Member Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| I want to start off by complimenting the Mayor and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| for putting together a very good package here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| funding some very important projects in this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| If I could, I was going to talk to Director Juneau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| and try to unpack some of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| It is a rather complex document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| and I have heard some questions from folks out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| and just wanted to make sure everyone was very clear about what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| But Director Juneau, it looks to me like there's two funding sources here for this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| There's ARPA money and FTA money. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| Yes, there are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| There are actually three sources, one of which would be general fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4920)|
| 1:22:07| Yes, as far as rescue dollars, there are two sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| Okay. And we've got in here $21 million of ARPA funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| and that funding has limited uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| It's not something that we can use for anything we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| There is direction on what it can and cannot be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| That is correct. There are parameters on that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| Okay. And then with regard to the $13.3 million from the FTA funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| that funding is fully funding CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4956)|
| 1:22:44| and so CAT is not going to have any reduced services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| It's not having any money removed from that line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| CAT is fully funded just like it was when the budget was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Okay. But that full funding for FTA also means that there's $13.3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| in unencumbered, unrestricted funds available to fund the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| that we're seeing in part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| The part of this is not funded through general funds, which is a small portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| the smallest portion, or an amount that's funded from the ARPA, which is the most?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| Okay. And so I support all the projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| and I think everyone here supports all the projects listed in the budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| but I also think council now has an opportunity to have a discussion about public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| that we've all certainly been hearing out there in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| And I want to make it clear that council can do two things at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5023)|
| 1:23:51| We can support our uniformed employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| We can make sure that they have all the resources they need to do their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| We can also fund important programs like violence intervention and interruption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| and other projects that we've all talked about here many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| To that point, we've got a salary survey going on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| and that salary survey is looking at addressing competitive pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| for our uniformed service members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| And I do think it's a good time for us to have that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| and talk about addressing those longstanding issues that we've all been dealing with for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5065)|
| 1:24:34| What I wanted to do is ask if Kevin Faddis might come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| and talk to us a little bit about the experiences that he's seen for our uniformed officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5079)|
| 1:24:46| uniformed employees, fire department, police, and council's ability to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5086)|
| 1:24:54| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Please come to the bench, not the bench, the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| If you could just state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| and then speak to Councilman Roberto's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| But you'll recognize me with a mustache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| It's coming along just good. It's one day's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| Kevin Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Charles, you coughed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| You called me out all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Can you repeat what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| I was asking, can you talk to us a little bit about some of the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| uniformed officers have had or uniformed employees have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| with regard to competitive pay and its impact on recruitment and retention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| Throughout the years, I think you guys, as leaders of the community, are full-on aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| we are doing another salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| In the past, we've had different mayors, different administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| We've had a Mercer plan, a Siegel plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| The Mercer plan wasn't fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| The Siegel plan wasn't fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| So here we are doing another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| I have the utmost confidence this time it will be fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| But to Andrew's question, I'm sorry, Councilman Roberto's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| yeah, we're losing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| I think retention and retainment and recruitment, the three R's, that's big here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| Knoxville, I want Knoxville to be on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| We're a class two fire department, which is we've only got one more class to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| That's a class one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| That's the best we could ever be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| We've led the state, I guess, in training hours even during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| I mean, those are things to be proud of that we do day in, day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| You know, retention, recruitment, reward, retention, recruitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| I think I've talked to Mayor Kincaid about that, the three R's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| And I think it's something big here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| I mean, we need to recruit talent from all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| I want Knoxville to be the best there is and have competitive wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| And, you know, what we talked about here, we have a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| just like the previous speakers spoke about, we have a chance to act on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| put money aside to see what happens, you know, after the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| So later on down the road, down when we get March, April, May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| and the salary survey comes back, whether it's for or against us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| we can say, well, now where are we going to get these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| Well, I know where we're going to get the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| They're sitting right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Nobody's touched them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| So I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Does anybody have anything else for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| I can certainly let others ask questions if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| You can just stay nearby if people have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Yeah, you might get asked another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| For some reason I can't hear you guys real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Okay, I'll try to speak closer into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| It's like speakers are back here, but my ear's this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| I'm usually good at hearing things, but it's muffled for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Well, and I think another point, Director Janot, I wanted to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| is this the only time we're going to see this type of funding come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| or is this something that happens in installments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| This is the first tranche of two tranches on the ARPA funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| Yeah, you need to speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Even though you want to face Mr. Roberto, you sort of can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| This is the first tranche of two tranches on the ARPA funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| The FTA funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| I have no knowledge as to whether there will be an additional tranche of FTA dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| It was last year and this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| I don't think we would anticipate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| I think Mr. Brace is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| That's how it's played out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| So I'd be surprised if we got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| It's a one-time allocation to just confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| But essentially that sets a cap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| and that cap is slightly higher than our annual appropriation to CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5319)|
| 1:28:46| So there will be a very small amount left over to draw against next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| presuming there's no unforeseen additional expenses this year in the CAT system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| And so what we're hearing then is that we've got this is the first installment in several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5335)|
| 1:29:02| or in two installments, that will come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| And so I think the discussion that we can have is I've been in these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| and a lot of people may be watching at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| haven't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| but I've heard the commitment that everyone has had towards public safety here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| and doing two things at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| Because we can both have programs that are helping folks in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| and we can also make sure we're supporting public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| And so I think this is a great opportunity for us to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| And, you know, we can talk about what funding is going on today in these numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5373)|
| 1:29:40| that we're just talking about in this, like I said, well-crafted budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| And then there will be additional funds that will come in at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| and we can talk about taking care of priorities at that time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| Because I know the support that our uniformed employees have here in this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5393)|
| 1:30:01| and I just want to thank Mr. Faddis for coming up and talking to us about it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| so we could have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| Just to clarify, these funds have to be for one-time purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| Salaries are ongoing by definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| I am really proud that this proposal includes significant hero pay for our firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| and police officers and also bonuses for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| And that is reflective of – I put that in there because I know that our first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| have been working really hard, as have all our employees, and they deserve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| And so we're not forgetting first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| We're not forgetting our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| We cannot put these monies towards ongoing expenses such as salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| Mr. Brace, did you have something you could add to that information, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| I just wanted to mention I think I've had several meetings with Mr. Faddis about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| obviously, the concerns about compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| and relayed your commitment to the compensation study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| funding that study, and looking at it in the upcoming budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Mrs. Drummond, Dr. Drummond, is – that scope of work will provide preliminary information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5463)|
| 1:31:10| that the mayor can use as she starts to lay out her budget in the fiscal year 22-23 process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| And then obviously working with Mr. Faddis, fire, and police on the premium pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| Again, premium pay followed up with the study I think is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| hopefully a commitment to making a big difference in compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| Thank you, Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| I don't know who can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| I may have more than one, but first, when did these funds have to be expended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5504)|
| 1:31:52| I believe by December 31 of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| Boyce, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| They have to be encumbered by December 31st of 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| and they have to be completely dispersed, this tranche and the second tranche,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| by December 31st of 2026.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| So follow-up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| These are budget allocations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| and then contracts will come back to us if any contract has to be expended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5542)|
| 1:32:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| I'm just making sure for the record everybody understands that this money goes in a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| and then funds are not expended until we as council vote to expend the funds through a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| Next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| I see a lot of things in here that everything's good that's in here we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5566)|
| 1:32:53| but my understanding of the purpose of these funds is to help cities make themselves whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5573)|
| 1:33:04| from the hardship that the pandemic caused for normal operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5584)|
| 1:33:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| That is one facet, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Because it looks to me like some of the things that we're talking about doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| puts money back to things or makes us whole for things that we expended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| Council Member Fugate, if I could just respond also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| This is recovery and relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| This council has not waited for the federal funds to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| We've invested a lot in helping people since the pandemic started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| And while we invested in those social services, we stopped investing or paused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| or limited our investments in paving and traffic calming and sidewalk maintenance and roofs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| and some of these things that are really important to be good stewards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| and also really important to our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| So we are able with these funds to continue to support the arts community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| the social services community, our unhoused neighbors and affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| and that sort of thing, while also addressing these needs that we had to put on pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| because of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| So your characterization is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Thank you for making my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| What happens in a crisis is you divert funds from normal operations to fund crisis operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5668)|
| 1:34:36| which was increased funding for all the social services that we did, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| So I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| Thank you for confirming that was my take on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| And so while there are lots of wonderful good things that we can and should do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| I believe the purpose that federal tax dollars that all citizens paid into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| federal taxes are coming back to us to make cities whole and get back on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| for things that they did not do while we diverted ourselves from the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| There is some additional funding, but this is not a windfall of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| for whatever we want to use it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| I think Council Member Ryder was next and then Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| I just want to say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| So number one, to tack on to what was just said by the mayor and Mr. Jeneau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| and Councilwoman Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| there are neighborhoods out there that were expecting various projects like traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5745)|
| 1:35:52| I don't think general paving is included in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| but there are just a lot of different things that people were expecting and their time was due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5755)|
| 1:36:02| and those things were delayed and paused because of the austerity budget that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| And this gives us a chance to catch up with the things that we cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| And so I have constituents who are like, yay, we're back in play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| and we don't have to wait an additional year because we have all these unfunded projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| and we never have enough to fund them in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| So I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| Looking at the numbers here, so the total of this budget amendment is around $35 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5787)|
| 1:36:33| That includes $21 million for SLFR, $13.3 million from FTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5793)|
| 1:36:41| So the total, Mr. Jeneau or anybody else who chimes in, but I'm asking Mr. Jeneau for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| The total anticipated for what we're going to get for ARPA, which includes SLFR and FTA dollars, is 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5807)|
| 1:36:57| Hold on, I've got to scroll up and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| Oh, my goodness. It's a long one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| 42.453 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| In the AIS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| That is correct. That's ARPA funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| Our total package of ARPA funding by the formula is 42 point, we'll say, 5 mil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| Round it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| 42.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| And what we're looking at out of this 35 mil budget amendment is 34.3 million based on this AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5849)|
| 1:37:38| The 21 mil SLFR and the 13.3 mil FTA is a total of 34.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5858)|
| 1:37:49| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| So we will have another, pardon me for my bad math, 7, 8 million that we haven't budgeted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5872)|
| 1:38:02| We'll actually have another 21 million, 226,706.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| No, no, no, I don't mean funds received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| Well, that will be the second tranche of the ARPA funding that's not included here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| So when you're looking at that 42 point almost 5 million, that is the SLRF funding, which is the ARPA funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5898)|
| 1:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| That we are receiving that in two tranches over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| The FTA funding is in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| One way to think about it is the ARPA, what I call ARPA, American Rescue Plan dollars that come directly to the city of Knoxville because we're a local municipality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5917)|
| 1:38:45| is 21 million this year and 21 million next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| That's been appropriated by Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| We've already had the first tranche in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| We expect to get the second tranche in the bank next May or June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| But the FTA dollars have come to us not because we're the city of Knoxville but because we have CAT here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5937)|
| 1:39:04| Those are federal dollars that go directly through transit that are going to CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| We are not guaranteed to get that next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| This year the proposal is the 21 million plus the amount from CAT plus the balance to get to 35 million is from our general fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5951)|
| 1:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| So let me rephrase my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| We have another 21.2 million tranche coming that we have not budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5966)|
| 1:39:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| And is not included in this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| I think that's important to really be clear about that we're only budgeting the first tranche, which I have no idea what that word means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5979)|
| 1:39:47| I'm playing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Allotment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| Is that what it means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| Does somebody want to look it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Is that a synonym for something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| I'm like Wall Street finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| I'm going to look it up because that's what I do in a minute when I have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| But we've got another 21 million we haven't earmarked to certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| So we've been able to catch up on some things but not all things with the first tranche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| And the second tranche has not arrived into our bank accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| That's why we're not proposing the spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| Unless the U.S. government goes out of business, we're going to get it, but we don't have it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| But there is time to say this, for example, when I have a meeting with the mayor to say I think this needs to be, I think X needs to be a priority in the next tranche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6021)|
| 1:40:33| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| We have that opportunity still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| So my constituents out there have time to send me an e-mail and say you need to advocate for this X in your meeting with the mayor about the next tranche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6037)|
| 1:40:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| A couple of points of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| So these funds cannot be used for salaries, only bonuses, because salaries are ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6059)|
| 1:41:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| So these funds cannot be used for salary adjustments or increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| That answers my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| My second question is, can these dollars be used to go into the task force, the equity task force line item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6076)|
| 1:41:30| I'll kick this over to Mr. Lomax here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| As we had talked, I think there could be some uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| I think one of the challenges with the ARPA dollars are the treasury requirements and the reporting requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6096)|
| 1:41:44| We'll talk about that later with allocations to the United Way and to nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| There are significant reporting requirements that have to be in place should we be audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| And so I know that Mr. Lomax and that Vice Mayor McKenzie and the mayor are all committed to the task force working on and bringing in this next budget process, fiscal year 22-23 budget process, an allocation recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6113)|
| 1:42:09| And I'm not sure if either you or Mr. Lomax would like to talk more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| But that was the plan, was to be prepared, do the groundwork that needs to be done so an allocation can be recommended up to the mayor and for discussion by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6133)|
| 1:42:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| That was my original understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| But then, you know, with the comments, and I do appreciate the speakers and Council Member Parker's comments, it did raise that additional question to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6147)|
| 1:42:35| And I thought, I was pretty certain that there were some of the reporting requirements and we did not have the recommendations at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6155)|
| 1:42:43| So I was not sure if it would be applicable, any of those dollars to go into that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| So that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| First thing, I want to take care of Mr. Faddis' question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| So we're doing the salary comparison to see, you know, are we paying the correct amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| And then where do we have funds available if we need to rectify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| That's going to be a question we're going to see the results of the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| And then we will see how much off we are from our peer organizations and how much we can afford to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6195)|
| 1:43:22| And we'll just have to see where we are at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| It's not like we have a pot of money stashed away that we're keeping from our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| But as you know, you know, our long-term expenditures, you know, and our long-term revenues need to, you know, we need to make sure that our revenues keep up with our expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6210)|
| 1:43:39| So we're waiting to see the results of that study, and then we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| But I don't have a recommendation because I don't have the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| Well, I know we don't have a recommendation yet, but I just wanted to answer the issue why you're still standing there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6226)|
| 1:43:53| Actually, I wanted to add something when everybody got done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| Just so everybody knows, I absolutely know that none of this money can go to salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| None of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| I tell my guys that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| Chief Sharp knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| What I was saying is, did council, did the budget appropriate money to CAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| If they did, now the FTA has taken care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| Every time I talk, Charles coughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| So what I was saying is the FTA, if they took care of that, then that frees up dollars from our budget to move aside to sit in case something happens at the end of the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6262)|
| 1:44:34| So I absolutely, I'm not a big dummy, but I know none of this money can be used for salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| So that's not what I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| That's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| Councilman Roberto, do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| I think I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| I think what you're saying is that you're asking for a commitment to deal with the, well, let me start this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6292)|
| 1:45:03| We've got premium pay in this budget amendment, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6303)|
| 1:45:09| We've got to take other steps, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| We've got to address retention and recruitment, and we can look at that with whether there's options to deal with that with bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6313)|
| 1:45:22| But it could also be what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| The big thing is the salary survey and how we're going to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| I still think we're talking in circles, and it may be my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| What I'm getting, somebody stop me, probably you, is did we have money from our budget going to CAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6334)|
| 1:45:43| We did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| From our budget, not ARPA money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| And those are local funds that have been freed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| However, they're one-time funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| So they would really not be available for ongoing operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| Such as salary increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| I do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| What I've asked for, so we're all on the same page, is a one-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| I'm not bucking the bonnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| I don't like it called hero pay, Mayor, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| I don't know if that's your deal, but we're regular people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| We just do hero work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| So, no, but I didn't know if we could carve that out, set it over here, as a one-time, since it's budgetary money, not from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6379)|
| 1:46:31| and at the end of the survey, we can draw from that pot, if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| And if we don't, then you can spend it on anything you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| That's just a guarantee to say, where are we going to get this money if we need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| And, bam, there it is, that one time to get it kick-started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| I probably should be looking at the Mayor now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Yeah, well, Mr. Patterson, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| Council Member Singh, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| I mean, am I making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| Yes, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Yes, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| It may not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| I just want to make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Yeah, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| I just wanted to grab this one, then I have other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| Okay, well, just as a point of clarification, the FTA dollars, which frees up money that we otherwise spent on CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| has been proposed for things that we deferred spending on during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| such as paving, signal pole replacement, traffic calming, transforming western blighted properties, park improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6441)|
| 1:47:31| all these things that have been deferred that are really important to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| plus investments at the Beck Cultural Center, IM's Nature Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| some investments in sustainability, bus stop improvements, sidewalk safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| These are the dollars that are not being supported by the ARPA, but through the CAT transfer that's freed up through general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6467)|
| 1:47:54| So, you guys have all that in your backup, and I think those are important investments that I'm pleased that hopefully we can renew investment in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6474)|
| 1:48:05| So, basically, that's been spoken for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| In this proposal, it has, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| That's what I was asking, if we can carve that out, but it's, from what I understand, going to go towards those projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| paving, Beck, and all that other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| I wasn't aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| I'm just trying to think outside the box here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Mr. Faddis, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| Okay, I have questions about the stormwater projects and KUB, the water system projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6508)|
| 1:48:38| I think that the stormwater projects, it's something that is very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| I'm seeing flooding all over the city, and it's something we've got to deal with, and I think it's just going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| But the KUB piece, is there someone here from KUB, or should I speak to Ms. Janot to talk to us about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6527)|
| 1:48:56| Ms. Janot is here, and Deputy Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| Between the three of us, we'll probably be able to address your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| What's the question exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| Well, mainly, isn't that what they charge wastewater fees for every single month, to do this type of repair work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6545)|
| 1:49:15| So I want to kind of emphasize here that the ARC proper, the $21 million that Ms. Janot explained earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6555)|
| 1:49:24| that was very limited on the type of infrastructure that it could be used for, and specifically water and sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6564)|
| 1:49:31| the only little tiny sliver of that infrastructure that we do directly is stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| which is why, to your point, it is a very important investment that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| The other components, of course, are covered by KUB within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| and alongside the county, recognizing that these dollars can be critical assets to our utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| in our case, KUB, to help address some very much needed water and sewer projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| that, again, we want to be recognizing the fact that ARPA can't supplant rate increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6597)|
| 1:50:04| That's actually in the guidance. Rate and tax increases are not allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| I'm trying to speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| But KUB has proposed projects within the city that can be done with these dollars in such a way that it then allows them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6611)|
| 1:50:18| more flexibility for those additional rates that they're collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| So, again, they have a limited ability, based on the rates that they're collecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| to do projects that are needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| As we do, they prioritize, and so this allows them to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| they're not here to speak on this directly, but accelerate some of the work that they would otherwise want to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| And so, again, it's a way to make sure that those critical infrastructure investments are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| and it's one that is directly in line with the ARPA eligibility guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| I know infrastructure is very important, but you were saying it allows KUB to accelerate the rate of the work that they've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6643)|
| 1:50:52| what is it called, the century, when they had to redo all of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| Yeah, Century 2 and PACE 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| And I believe, Mr. Jeneau or Mr. Evans, you may have seen the specific list of projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| and we included some of that detail in your AIS around the projects that they were particularly looking at for these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| Yeah, in the AIS, there's, I mean, there is a listing of some of the specific projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6671)|
| 1:51:19| I've even got a bigger list in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| They laid out what they planned to do with every penny of it should we provide it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6682)|
| 1:51:30| Your base question was, are they going to use dollars to do infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| They would normally use revenue from their rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| They use revenue to develop a capital program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| Just like any utility or municipality or county, they have more needs and they have resources each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6701)|
| 1:51:48| So this will allow them to do additional projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| The ARPA language was very specific about stormwater and water distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| And so KUB made an ask to do some additional projects that they need to do in the system within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6717)|
| 1:52:05| Okay. I don't know how I feel about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| I mean, we've been paying a lot on the wastewater for the century program for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| so I understand the need for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| But I guess I'm saying the stormwater project is something that we need to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6736)|
| 1:52:23| I think I would have also liked more time to look over this and have more of a conversation amongst us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| because I have said this so many times, when things come in front of us, it's already, it's a package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| And if I vote yes on it, I'm voting yes on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| And I don't like doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| I wish we could have things presented to us in pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| Because most of this I really like, but some of it, not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| Council Member Singh, just a reminder, this is just first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| So there'll be two more weeks in between this vote and the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| So does that mean on the next meeting, maybe it'll be split up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| You'll have more time to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Still doesn't solve the issue I'm bringing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| Council Member Singh brought up an issue that I also have with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| And I did raise it with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| I also wish it were broken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| And we were just talking about ARPA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| We can even talk about the FTA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| But once we start talking about money for the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| without having our upcoming workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| without having an opportunity to vote up or down on the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| but we're committing to additional expenses associated with the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| It's not just the economic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| And if it were just the economic impact study, I would have concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Because we were not able to review a contract before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6833)|
| 1:53:59| for an economic development study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| If we were, we hopefully would have been able to have a robust conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| about how unreliable these studies are from CSL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6845)|
| 1:54:12| Of course CSL is going to produce an economic study impact report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| that says we're going to come out great in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| So I don't think city council should be asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| the city of Knoxville should be asked to pay for this study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| when we didn't even get a chance to review the proposal from the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6867)|
| 1:54:36| So that's one thing I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| The other thing I wanted to say, since there was so much discussion about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| because as someone who has studied civil rights law and history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| this is a pet peeve of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| A pet peeve of mine is that federal governments say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| hey, we have these priorities in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| And the only way that we're going to get this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| to implement these priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| this country that has a racist, sexist, classist history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| the only way we're going to get them to implement it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| is if we tie money to it and send it to the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| And we say, hey, cities, if you take this funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| you've got to comply by certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| With this funding, because of the pandemic and because of the crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| cities have more flexibility than before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| Like with the FTA funding, now we can reimburse ourselves 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| FTA puts money forward and says, cities, I know y'all are going to struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| We don't want you to cut public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| But that doesn't mean we can't enhance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| If we get federal dollars in for transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| it does not mean we can't enhance in that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| We don't have to completely place our local dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| with the federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| One thing I wanted to make sure of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| which I haven't had time to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| in the amount of time that we've had to review this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| is to make sure some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| that bus drivers were experiencing last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| have been addressed this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| Last year I was being told that if they were out sick for COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| some of their sick leave would be cut into in the upcoming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| meaning this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| And so they were giving me complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| that their leave time was less this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| I don't know if that's been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| There are other issues that we have to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| to ensure that our workers are doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| And I would like some assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| that those are addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| before we completely 100% reimburse ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| for the money that goes to our CAT bus system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| But we've gotten no assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| That's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| And there have been a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| about how this money can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| So I wanted to read for you all what is in the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| These funds may be used to, first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| respond to the public health emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| or its negative economic impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| including assistance to households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| assistance to small businesses and nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| or aid to impacted industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| such as tourism, travel, and hospitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| That's number one on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| Next is to respond to workers performing essential work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| That's the hero pay for the provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| of government services to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| of the reduction in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| I'm okay with us saying we had some reduction in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| But we all know that the budget that we have been passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| we've seen higher sales tax revenue than projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| We've grown our fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| above what we projected it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| our fund balance is not lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| than we projected it would be before the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| Next, to make necessary investments in water, sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| or broadband infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| is one of the key components of this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| We should not think of this funding coming in as money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| that's just supposed to come to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| to reimburse us for money we spent last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| or to help us spend money we weren't able to spend last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| This is aid for our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| trying to recover during this pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| in addition to those other goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| So I wanted to state that outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| This money can definitely be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| for the purposes I've raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| and that our speakers have raised today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| We are just simply showing where the city's priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| Now, I can imagine telling the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| that they're going to have to wait a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| for their traffic calming project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| It's hard for me to go back to my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| and tell them that the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| that the city supposedly made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| to addressing the extreme poverty in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| has to wait until next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| But that's what I'm being told tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| I'm being told tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| that there's another allotment of $21 million coming next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| and once again, black folks, poor folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| y'all can wait until next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| because we have some neighborhood projects to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| I'm saddened but not shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| Any other questions or comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| I just want to recap a few things that I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| but also some things I've heard from people all around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| These are dollars that are one-time use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| and there will be at least $21 million of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| There will be another $21 million again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| This is just to help recap a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| These can only be used for one-time expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| and a lot of these represent things that we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| at least I've heard from the 1st District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| and across the city for a long, long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| which are stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| additional homelessness resources for non-congregate housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| transportation, mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| regular uniformed employees who do hero work pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7227)|
| 2:00:33| and I think some grassroots funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| that will be distributed to nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| who help fill in the glue in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| through the United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| These are also all things we put on hold largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| because of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| And so I went back and did some homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| a little bit for the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| We put those things on hold so that we could offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| this council offered almost $1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| for economic opportunity grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| $1 million, as we stated earlier, for violence intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| $9 million for social empowerment agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| such as CAC who give people to their doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| for testing, for food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| We spent $11 million over the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| on homeless outreach and shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| $19 million for housing assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| $27 million in affordable housing resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| and we funded a $58 million cap budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| So let us not forget that this is not an either-or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| and we put a lot of those basic things on hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| that we consider everyday services of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| and I would say take for granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| to fund the most urgent needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| which were high at-risk youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| those experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| and a lot of folks who were just coming up short on money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| and access to basic services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| So that is a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| I lost track of the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| but that was just a sample of for the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| what this council urgently spent money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| And so all of these things over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| are just not nice-to-haves that are for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| They're basic services and they're fundamental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| I would say, particularly for the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| There are a lot of blighted buildings in the 1st District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| and now we've cut that, we had cut that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| for facade grants and things that would help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| That goes towards reducing poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| helping folks get in small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| and that's not just for South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| that's for across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| There are a lot of things in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| roadway paving, traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| We just talked about the Bike Walk Knoxville resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| Well, that impacts people's lives, people die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| So there's going to be funding for those types of things now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| that we couldn't fund for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| And stormwater, due to climate change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| could not be more important to people's houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| apartments, et cetera, flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| There's a person on Stone Road I think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| almost every time we talk about stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| whose basements get flooded just from the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| So I just don't want us to forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| the hundreds of millions of dollars that we spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| without waiting on the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| We also had plenty of help from the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| with that said, but we spent plenty of our city dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| to help those who were most marginalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| and most suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| So now we can refill some of those buckets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| and also do some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| that improve the quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| There's $35 million in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| Everybody in this room would spend it a little differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| but I think this is a pretty comprehensive approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| And particularly I'm really excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| pay to uniformed employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| The first time we've really spent money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| on homelessness shelter in a non-congregate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| That's something this body spent six and a half hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| discussing on a workshop a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| And we're doing some things that we promised we would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| such as continue to fund violence intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7439)|
| 2:04:10| and road pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| The basic services of the city are included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| I wish we could have dialed a couple things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| I wish we could have dialed a couple things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| But I think this is a pretty comprehensive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| to spend federal dollars that are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| for the five areas that Councilman Parker described earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| So I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7470)|

| 2:05:52| I was here before about a store fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| That's on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7555)|
| 2:06:02| It is to my surprise that I really wholeheartedly believe that the City of Knoxville burned that store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7562)|
| 2:06:12| The autopsy of the dead man has been falsified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| There's a picture of the dead man with a Tennessee TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| He's had an operation, a trek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| In his autopsy, it says his neck is unremarkable, meaning it's normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7588)|
| 2:06:35| The police report says there's no electric in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| They found electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| Those people, I know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| They are my in-laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| They bought that store one week, and it was stolen the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| We're here talking about new businesses growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| What happened to the old businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| What happened to the old businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| The man earlier mentioned Stan Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| I've sent him e-mails, at least one or two, at least one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| I've brought up this subject before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| I want to know what are we going to do about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| There is no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| We've got a criminal element within this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| If I'm wrong, prove it to me, and I know I'm right, and I know I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7642)|
| 2:07:29| And I believe some of you over there know that I'm right because I've sent e-mails to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7649)|
| 2:07:35| I want to know what are we going to do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| We've got three minutes to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7658)|
| 2:07:45| Just as a point of information, this is an opportunity for council to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| It's not a back-and-forth dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| So you have up to three more minutes to speak to them, and they can come speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| I've made my statement, and I'm being honest to God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| I've lived here 48 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| I came here when I was 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| I never thought I'd be here at 58 years old accusing the city of burning the business, and that's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7684)|
| 2:08:12| The man's name is India McDowell, the one that was supposed to have died in that fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| Take a look at the autopsy, any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| Take a look at that autopsy and get that picture from the TBI, and you'll find out I'm telling the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7700)|
| 2:08:31| You'll find out I'm telling the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| We're talking about federal money, new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| I'm all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| But I never thought I'd see the day when this city would actually burn a business, and that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7719)|
| 2:08:47| The city burned a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| Anyway, there's nothing more to say other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| I found an electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| The city said there's no electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| I found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| KUB had not told the truth, and neither did the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| And stand sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| I've sent him some e-mails, at least one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| Nothing replied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| The police report is bogus, and when anybody actually looks through it, they'll find out I'm telling the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7749)|
| 2:09:18| Anyway, there's no more to say other than that, because I'm sure within the three and a half minutes that I said, it's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7758)|
| 2:09:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| Mr. Zia, if you could share your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| It's 48 Ankara Court, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7771)|
| 2:09:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7776)|

| 2:09:42| Ms. Smear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| I thought you'd concluded your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| I don't know how many people are over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| Between all of us over here, there should be an answer to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| What are we going to do about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| Mr. Zia, someone can speak to you, but it's the other person's turn to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| Mr. Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| Emoja Abdul-Ahad, 116 South Elmwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| This time of year is always exciting for me, the elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| I really like election time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| We get a chance for citizens to participate and to make our voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7816)|
| 2:10:27| I read that there were like 90,000 people registered to vote in the city, I guess in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7827)|
| 2:10:35| And I think the final count for the primary this year was around 8,000 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| So I'm talking and making requests from the 81,000 people who have registered to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7842)|
| 2:10:52| but for whatever reason decide not to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| I'm talking to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| My name is Emoja Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| I have been working in the community for a long time to get voices heard on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| In other places, we have an organization called the City Council Movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| We're thinking about expanding it to do some other things other than just in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7873)|
| 2:11:19| Get in touch with me. I walk a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| I usually wear this hat and I carry this stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| We have a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| It's City Council Movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| I want to work with you, the 81,000 people who did not vote this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7890)|
| 2:11:37| so we can definitely make a difference in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| This is my town. I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| I was born here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| I think I've been active a pretty good while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| So to the 81,000 people who are looking and watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7910)|
| 2:11:56| I think you look at us and you see sincerity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| You see commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| You won't see any anger, any rancor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| but we're serious about making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| Come and join us. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| The next person signed up to speak is Alunga King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7934)|
| 2:12:21| Alunga King, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| Moving on to the next person, June Roston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| Ms. Roston, if you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| and start by stating your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7954)|
| 2:12:52| My name is June Roston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| My address is 17522 Highway 95 North, Greenback, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7974)|
| 2:13:01| I'm here as the vice president of the Knoxville Oak Ridge Area Central Labor Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7981)|
| 2:13:08| speaking on behalf of the group of unions who decided to ask for a community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7988)|
| 2:13:17| around the new stadium that's to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=7997)|
| 2:13:23| Our labor council represents unions and union members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| in the 15-county area around Knoxville and Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| It's about 20,000 members and union households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| But we're also the voice of a lot of workers who don't have a voice in the workplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| because we are the voice for the American Federation of Labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| the Congress of Industrial Organizations in this area, in this part of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8027)|
| 2:13:53| And that's one of the reasons that we decided to get involved in the effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8033)|
| 2:14:00| to get a community benefits agreement for the new stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| All of the city council members, you received about a month ago a letter that listed our core asks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8046)|
| 2:14:15| So I'm not going to go through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| I think tonight I'm just going to concentrate on a couple of those things that we have asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8057)|
| 2:14:24| One is to make sure that you understand that we are in favor of minority contractors and minority businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8064)|
| 2:14:35| Our building trades unions and other unions are used to working with minority contractors and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8075)|
| 2:14:42| They do it at Oak Ridge. They do it at TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| The federal government has a priority on minority contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8085)|
| 2:14:52| So that's one of the things that we asked for in the CBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| And I wonder if somebody doesn't need to ask if there doesn't need to be more than 15% participation by minority contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8097)|
| 2:15:07| because by the time you include veterans and women as a part of DBEs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8107)|
| 2:15:14| how much does that leave for African American and of color businesses and contractors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8114)|
| 2:15:23| The other thing I want to talk about quickly is that don't get tricked by the fact that the developers are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8123)|
| 2:15:34| apprenticeship training programs and they say they're certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| The kind of apprenticeship training programs we're talking about are those that are certified by the U.S. Department of Labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8138)|
| 2:15:47| It's not easy to get those certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| You wouldn't want to get on an airplane with a pilot who had been through a short-cutted training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| Well, it's the same thing with construction trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| You want apprenticeships who have been through certified training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| And these programs are paid for by the unions and by the contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| It's the best way for people, particularly from East Knoxville, low-income folks in our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8171)|
| 2:16:18| to enter in and learn a trade and to be guaranteed that it won't be just a job for a while the stadium is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8178)|
| 2:16:26| because if they become an apprentice and then become a member of that union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8186)|
| 2:16:32| then the union will help them find a job when that construction project is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| So it's the best way to guarantee that people will have a good career path and a pension and health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8198)|
| 2:16:47| And the other thing I want to point out is that we've asked that this be put in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| It's really important that any agreements that developers are making be put in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8212)|
| 2:16:58| and that everybody can read what those agreements are and know what has been promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8218)|
| 2:17:06| It's important that the people in Knoxville's communities and Knoxville's workers have a written agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8226)|
| 2:17:15| about what has been promised to them and to other people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8235)|
| 2:17:21| And it's up to you because you will vote for the funding, the tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8241)|
| 2:17:27| It's up to you to make sure that that's part of the deal that's going to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8247)|
| 2:17:33| You have the say-so about whether those tax dollars are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| So I hope that you'll do your due diligence to your constituents and to the workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| and the community people in Knoxville who deserve to benefit from this very important project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8263)|
| 2:17:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| Next person signed up to speak is Centris Hodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| Centris Hodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8278)|
| 2:18:07| You can start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| My name is Ventris Hodge, 1610 Greenbrier Ridgeway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| Once again, my name is Ventris Hodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| I am a bus dropper for Knoxville Area Transit and a member of the Automated Transit Workers Union, Local 1164.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8302)|
| 2:18:32| My local union and I are also members of Jobs for Justice of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| Jobs for Justice is a coalition of unions, community organizations, and faith-based organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8319)|
| 2:18:46| and individuals who believe in workers' rights and in social economic justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8326)|
| 2:18:52| As a coalition, we want to see economic projects, particularly ones that receive public taxpayers' funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8332)|
| 2:19:01| be projects that provide not just any jobs, but good jobs with living wages, benefits, and protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8341)|
| 2:19:10| and not just any development, but development that will increase the dignity and quality of life for Knoxville residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8350)|
| 2:19:20| We want to see this proposed development and the new Smoky Stadium be a real community benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8360)|
| 2:19:28| that builds towards a Knoxville for all, not just a project to benefit the already wealthy or privileged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8368)|
| 2:19:38| And we want to see agreements in writing that establish consequences if they fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8378)|
| 2:19:45| The stadium project has potential to be a huge economic boost for working families in our cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8385)|
| 2:19:52| However, as we've learned from similar examples across the country, without clear agreements made on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8392)|
| 2:20:00| there is also potential for local workers to get sidestepped in favor of what we call low road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8400)|
| 2:20:08| contractors that rely primarily on low-wage and out-of-state labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| Knoxville also, like many cities and towns, has made decisions and policies in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8415)|
| 2:20:21| that led to racial inequity and economic inequality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8421)|
| 2:20:30| This was acknowledged by the city council in the resolution from Council McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8430)|
| 2:20:38| passed ununanimously last December, that recognized the deletion of Black community businesses, churches, and schools in 1959| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8438)|
| 2:20:50| as part of the city's projects coined urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| Several hundred of East Knoxville's largely African-American families were displaced and businesses were lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8455)|
| 2:21:05| The consequences of this destruction and displacement fell on Knoxville's Black residents and continue to be felt today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8465)|
| 2:21:18| Where are conversations with low-wealth families and people of color whose homes are lack thereof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8478)|
| 2:21:26| And institutions may face another round of displacement or disruption from the stadium's projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8486)|
| 2:21:33| In Nashville, groups of volunteers from the organization called Stand Up Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8493)|
| 2:21:40| initially held direct conversations with low-wealth community residents from the area their stadium would be built in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8500)|
| 2:21:49| and asked them how such a project could benefit their outstanding needs as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8509)|
| 2:21:57| We have not seen this type of direct outreach with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| Jobs in the trades are in a very important path toward economic security in African-American men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8523)|
| 2:22:11| Non-construction jobs that will come with ballpark, such as entertainment, hospitality jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8531)|
| 2:22:21| should not get public support unless they pay a living wage and unless workers are treated with dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8541)|
| 2:22:30| A project like this should improve our affordable housing, not increase gentrification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8550)|
| 2:22:38| by placing the profits in the hands of a few already wealthy developers, investors, and or realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8558)|
| 2:22:47| Lastly, the way this project is built should further not demise any goals and address climate change and sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8567)|
| 2:22:59| A few basic written agreements in place should help ensure that this project results in access to good jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8579)|
| 2:23:10| training, and long-term career pathways for workers in the greater Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8590)|
| 2:23:18| Ms. Hodge, that concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| Last speaker is Mr. Greg Duthie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8607)|
| 2:23:33| Greg Duthie, 3829 Debonair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| About a month ago I was in here and had city council members stand in my appreciation of all the hard work you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8616)|
| 2:23:46| And I'm not going to have you stand tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| I'm just going to say I forgot one important thing is the sacrifices that you make to your families by serving the position that you serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8628)|
| 2:24:00| There's a lot of time away from your children and your spouses, and that comes with the territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| So thank you for that sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| The previous speaker earlier encouraged you to vote, and I'm talking to the public watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8649)|
| 2:24:15| I'm doing the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| One thing you may not know if you're watching and listening is that although we have five city council positions up for re-election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8657)|
| 2:24:27| people in one district that Mr. Thomas presides over, you can also vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8667)|
| 2:24:35| You don't just vote for the city council member who is the incumbent or the person running against them in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8675)|
| 2:24:43| You vote for all the districts, and that hasn't really been made clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| So when you go out to vote, and I hope people go out to vote, vote for all of the people that you have available to vote for in the five districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8688)|
| 2:24:58| I wanted to say something about public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| Thank you for the public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| I hope someone compliments them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| I saw a need for some upkeep on the greenway from Marine Park up to the Alcoa Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8707)|
| 2:25:14| They went out and did some hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| There's still some more work to be done on cutting things back that are growing onto the bike path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| but we have a wonderful greenway at Marine Park that's off of Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| You can park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| You can rollerblade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| You can bike and run, which I do most every day down there, and I appreciate the city's work down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8730)|
| 2:25:36| One other thing that comes to mind is it's clearly signed down there at Marine Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8736)|
| 2:25:41| and we do have both city and county ordinances leash law-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8741)|
| 2:25:46| so those dog lovers and dog owners, be aware of our ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| You have to have your dog on a leash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| Unleashed dogs get spooked sometimes when runners like me go by or bikers, and there can be accidents that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8754)|
| 2:26:03| And finally, my compliments go out to the Knoxville Police Department, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8763)|
| 2:26:11| I've been working recently in the Norwood area over off of Merchant Drive and Debonair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8771)|
| 2:26:19| It's Councilperson Thomas' and Councilperson Singh's districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| They come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| I've been working with a lot of people who are disabled and afraid to get involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| trying to improve the neighborhood, even if it isn't a neighborhood that I live in directly all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8792)|
| 2:26:38| It's some neighborhood that I care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| Ran into Officer Parks the other day and spoke with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8801)|
| 2:26:46| and appreciated his help on some safety issues in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| Then I spoke with Sergeant Williams just recently this weekend on another safety parking visibility issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8811)|
| 2:26:58| Got some great results with both those officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| And as you recall, you may have heard that the homeless group that was living in tents down there off Fifth Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8822)|
| 2:27:11| had a massive encampment on railroad property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| Since I volunteer with Lost Sheep Ministry and we serve them food and clothing every Wednesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8835)|
| 2:27:22| I was concerned how that would be navigated and how they would have them remove their things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8842)|
| 2:27:28| and ask them kindly to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| I'm happy to say that the railroad, I think, did a pretty good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| KPD was down there, particularly Officer Joey Matina and Captain Don Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| I spoke with them in length, along with the city's homeless coordinator, Sean Griffith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| I think there was a lot of compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| I spoke with a lot of the homeless people, and they complimented both Sean Griffith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| the homeless coordinator for the city of Knoxville, and both those officers, Don Jones and Joey Matina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8876)|
| 2:28:03| for working with them, showing compassion and patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8883)|
| 2:28:09| I spent much of that Friday morning, this was after our last city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| kind of observing how that all went down, and I think it went down as best that it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8894)|
| 2:28:21| It was quite a mess down there, but thanks to the city and the railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| we've improved that little neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8906)|
| 2:28:29| Appreciate all of your time, and God bless you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8909)|
| 2:28:36| Thank you, council. That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| Without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211019?start=8918)|
