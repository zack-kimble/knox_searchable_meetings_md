| 0:01:37| I'm reading 30 through 34, and it's about not being lazy, basically, but about working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=97)|
| 0:01:45| I just think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| I went past the field of sluggard, past the vineyard of someone who has no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=107)|

| 0:02:26| I've never been the biggest or the fastest or the strongest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| I've never been the smartest or the best looking, but I was raised to really outwork everybody and anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| and it's just a good lesson to learn, I think, in life, and it applies to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=157)|

| 0:40:40| I'm glad you guys went in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| We're pretty proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2441)|

| 0:40:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| Commissioner, since item number 27 was pulled from consent, if there are no objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| we are going to visit that when we start addressing our general government resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| and we will get through our public forum, drives and roads, line item transfers, budget amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| and spread of record, and then move it to the top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:15| Is everyone okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| This takes us to our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| We have two people signed up to speak, Kevin Murphy and Jesse Missner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:31| If there are no objections, Mr. Murphy is speaking to an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| However, Jesse Missner would fall under our general public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| If there are no objections, I would like to allow this person to speak now as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| We will move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Mr. Murphy, please approach the podium and state your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| Not working today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| The podium is not adjusting, but we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| I've come to speak to you about the item on closure of Old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| We had a meeting on Thursday evening of last week that was noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| and several community members showed up and expressed their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| I want to thank Director Snowden and some of his staff that came to that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| and sort of explained it to the community, described what they were looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| provide some insight and listen to our opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| and also to Commissioner Beeler for sponsoring the meeting and being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| First, we're in agreement that closing the west side of Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| which is at Murphy Road, as proposed, makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| We're all in agreement that allows the development to continue without delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| It improves the traffic situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| And I ask you to approve closing that side tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| We're also in agreement that there are significant safety issues over on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| which I'm going to call that the Luttrell Road intersection of Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| We're in agreement that there's some further issues down Tazewell Pike on Ridgeview Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| and Carter Road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| And we're also finally in agreement that further development is going to exacerbate those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| So in a lot of areas we are in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| and we want to make some improvements so that there's benefit to the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| But tonight in front of you, you've got two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| Either leave the Luttrell Road intersection of old Tazewell Pike open or close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| What many in the community would like to see are some additional options for you to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| I understand that requires going forward and looking at more of a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| and it would potentially be a capital project, but that's what we'd really like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| One thing that we'd asked about is, well, could we close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| This is a really funky intersection with six, Luttrell Road, old Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| and Tazewell Pike intersecting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| It's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Even if you close old Tazewell Pike as proposed right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| you still have access from the fast-moving Tazewell Pike onto Luttrell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| and the old Tazewell Pike that's not closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| So even closing, you still have some significant safety issues there that aren't addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| and there would be no plan to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| So that's one thing we suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| I know that Commissioner Beeler is really interested, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| in looking farther out at Ridgeview Road and Carter Road and Tazewell Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| That's also got some very, very challenging dynamics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| Really, I think it's almost the three of those together that need to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| There are some opportunities to look at funding with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| and Senator Massey is very interested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| and, thankfully, is chair of the Transportation Committee for the Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| so there are some opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| But those options aren't in front of you tonight, and that's what we're concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| because, importantly, if you choose the option to close old Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| then that at Luttrell Road, well, that's permanent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| and all of a sudden you're going to remove some future options off the table from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| which is something that we're really concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| So you take things off the table for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| and you still have a dangerous intersection where there's still this access onto Tazewell Pike with safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| In our visioning and planning, we call for multimodal connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| bicycles and pedestrians and other ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| and we talk about connectivity and local streets and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| Old Tazewell Pike provides that critical link for at least some pedestrian and vehicle access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| The county, about 15 or 18 years ago, they closed Shannon Valley Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| when Shannon Valley Farms was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| That was one of the east-west links.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| This is the second one, and that only leaves you Tazewell Pike and Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| and both of those roads are not at all suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| They do not have shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| They are not suitable for pedestrian traffic or bicycle traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| When I see pedestrian traffic, it is actually illegally going on the railroad tracks through that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| which is also dangerous, and the railroad is not exactly excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Finally, residents out there, they do a lot of their commerce in the Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| They go in on Tazewell Pike to go to their doctors or the CVS pharmacy or restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| Some goes down Washington Pike, but if you look at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| I put this on your handout on the back side, there's a map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| and I know Director Snowden had a good comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| Going down Luttrell Road adds a couple of minutes if you're going Washington Pike to the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| but if you're going Tazewell Pike, if you want to go into Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| you get to that intersection and you have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| You can either risk a left turn onto Tazewell Pike to go into town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| and that's a really dangerous risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| or your other alternate routes are Browns Gap Road or Luttrell Road and back up Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| Both of those add seven minutes and about three and a half miles each way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| So really, you know, there is significant impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| So we ask that you approve closing the west side at Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| but keep the east side open for right now and ask and encourage and fund engineering for what they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| ask them what they need to do a traffic study and to come up with some more options for you to look at there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Jesse Misner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| Please approach the podium, state your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2866)|

| 0:47:52| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| I'm here representing a multitude of stakeholders for A.L. Lots Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| I'm going to talk a little bit about crosswalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| though I will argue this has to go with schools in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| But the emphasis here will be A.L. Lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2881)|

| 0:48:06| Since that time, our county and our community, we have seen significant growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| In that area where A.L. Lots is, we have on Westland multifamily residential units being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| commercial units being built, and it's a main artery to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| With the growth that comes with it, we have to be careful of negative consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| We've got to be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| We've got to mitigate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| Basically, why I'm here, and to state it bluntly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| is that we're having failure for cars to yield and traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| While the traffic is a concern for any kid in the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| we're very concerned for the kids crossing the walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| First hand, we have seen cars fail to yield, near misses, and I'm talking about inches here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| fender benders, rear ends, frustrated, angry drivers yelling at kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| We have seen a gentleman curse at a 6-year-old crossing the street because it was inconvenient to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| The local community, we've stepped up to help out with this risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| I have contacted the local areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| We've cleaned the crossing signs, cleared the foliage, cleaned the crosswalk, got the crosswalk replanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| contacted the city sheriff, got speed traps set up, and we actually have a crossing guard coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| So these are steps to help mitigate the issue, but these are administrative addressments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:27| And the reason I'm here, and really the emphasis, and it's going to be the main point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| is I want to avoid any issues happening before this statistic occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| In attempting to resolve these resolutions, I've contacted the office for the sheriff's office, Eric Edlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| I've contacted Tracy Marsh at A.L. Lotz, Jay Morgan for TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| region one design supervisor, licensed engineer, and the Knox County Department of Engineering Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| We've actually put together several plans that show preliminary ideas of how to address some of the traffic congestion crossing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| Per the Knox County traffic counts, you can find that there are 12,310 cars that cross that every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=2996)|
| 0:50:06| So I emphasize again, in front of A.L. Lotz alone, there are 12,310 cars that cross that daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| that kids have to cross one way and one way back, with a speed limit set at 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| which we've already had to put speed traps in because it's not enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| If we look at the Federal Highway Administration, they put out a design criteria for uncontrolled crossing sections, which we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| They state at a traffic count of over 9,000 to use pedestrian hybrid beacons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| These are the cross arms that go across lights, or you can use the alternating wig-wag signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| which we have at Blue Grass and multiple other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| When I've contacted the city engineering department, they tell me there are certain criteria for the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| However, if we look at the highway's requirements for safety, and we're talking about elementary school kids here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| we are under-designed and do not meet the design criteria for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| Furthermore, if you look at the KGIS mapping, it shows that we're going to have a continued commercial and civic and residential growth in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| And stressing again, this is a main intersection connection to Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| It's understandable to have growth and development, but it's not understandable to not mitigate the risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| Evidence has showed that the implementation of these types of crosswalk signage have decreased the failure to use from 4% to 96%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:20| That is to say, where only 4% of drivers were yielding, 96% of drivers were now yielding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| These were flashing lights that notify directly that kids are crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| When you press the button, it turns on their attentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| And as I said, this is a multitude of issues with the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| We're concerned with the crosswalk because of the kids and the community users using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| But with the traffic in the area, it's also bad, multiple issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| AOLOT's principal has done a revamp of their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| We've actually talked to them about some of the ideas to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| And they've sent it up to the city district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| The county engineers are looking at it. I'm waiting for to hear back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| But ultimately, we have done a multitude of things to help mitigate the issues that are present and keep the kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:14| We have a crosswalk coming in, but those are only good as the crosswalk's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| And the rain, sleet, sunshine, you don't ever know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| What I'd like to conclude with is that I show that a problem exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| There's a risk to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| There's been too many near misses, and that's why I'm here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| And I've showed that through multiple stakeholders, there's a solution that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| I've talked to these stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| I continuously am told it's not in budget, it's not approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| Somebody's got to make the executive decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| What I present with the concern is justifiable evidence-based need for resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| We are underdesigned according to the highway transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| We have a design that can reduce significantly the risk for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| What I need is the support of local community leaders to provide a budget approval or assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| so that we can set aside these dangers and keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3183)|

| 0:54:58| and just to reiterate from last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| I did not receive any more communication last week from either party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| Is it your understanding that things continue to be resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| To my knowledge, there isn't any compromise that's been reached from opposing councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| I did speak with the Planning Commission today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| the planning staff today about this and got a little more history about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| There was, just slightly related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| I thought I would let the body know that when the design originally came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| they did show a common strip in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| And planning staff noted that in a particular section of the sub-regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| that a spot strip or reserve strip is prohibited by the sub-regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| So the designer actually revised it to include this area as a right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| So it was planning staff's intent for this property to be right-of-way for both adjoining parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3364)|

| 0:56:46| and the right-of-way is this many feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| In this case, 99.99% of our roads are 50-feet right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| I'm sure the gentleman that filled out the form just made that assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| because that's what he writes 999 times out of 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| Obviously, we did make a mistake in there, and we would just like to clarify this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| because the original developer did plat 100 feet for access to service the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| and we just put 50 because that's what we do almost all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| So my apologies about that mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3438)|

| 0:58:45| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| I just wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| I don't know if there will be more discussion or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| if my colleagues want to weigh in or not or ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| but you guys have received some really good information from Mr. Murphy as well as Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| so I do want to encourage you to vote your conscience on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| I'm not trying to sell this one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| but I do support it for a couple of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| and I can reserve comment on that if anyone else wants to weigh in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| Would you like me to go ahead and speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| I know I've stated this a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| I'm not trying to be a broken record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| I just want to give context to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I grew up in this immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| I lived with less than a mile from Otasville Pike for 33 years of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| 17 years, less than a half a mile south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| 18 years, less than a mile to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| My family used this road a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| I think it was probably, Mr. Snowden might remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| I think it was probably sometime in maybe the 90s or early 2000s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| that the county did put up some signage to discourage cut-through traffic on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| because it is very narrow, and we complied with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| and we have not used that road since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Now, that's a personal decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| I realize other people, there are some that do, some that don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| so it's one of those situations where no matter what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| somebody's going to be unhappy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| but there's a couple of reasons why I support this closure as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:29| One has to do with, well, they both have to do with the five-way, six-way strange intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| at the northeast end of Otasville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| If you can see it on a map, there are essentially three roads converging on one side of Otasville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| another road coming into the other side of Otasville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| It's a very problematic intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| Leaving the road open and doing nothing is not a good option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| because then you have a really bad intersection and a really narrow end of Otasville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| So if the road is left open, it is going to require some improvements, modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3660)|
| 1:01:09| First of all, those are going to be expensive if we do them right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| I would rather those resources be directed toward the improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| of the Ridgeview-Carter-Otasville Pike convergence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| which is less than a mile up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| That's really what causes people to want to use Otasville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| because of that heavy congested area that needs to be realigned and signalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| and that's what I've started discussions with Senator Massey about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| and some other engineers with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| In addition to that, if it is improved as it sits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| it's just going to invite even more cut-through traffic to that problematic intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| and that would really kind of defeat the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| because the purpose of this is to try to mitigate cut-through traffic, not increase cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| And then the second reason is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| for the road to be improved in the way it really needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| the entire right-of-way itself would need to be moved away from that five-way intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| Therefore, closing this road for now would not close the door on potentially opening it in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:25| because it would be on a completely different line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| It would not be on the line that it's used now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| I think it's an inappropriate cut-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| I think there are some other things that need to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| for traffic to be the way it needs to be in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| Mainly, Carter, Ridgeview, and Tassel Pike needs to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| and we need to get TDOT to the table and get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| But for now, I think this is the right engineering decision, so that's why I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:55| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Commissioner Beeler, so the map that's in our packet is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| with the closure on the left-hand side and the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| So that's the official version that's in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| As I understand it, let me look at it very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| I kind of know this by heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| Mr. Snowden, what we have in our packet, is that the official closure then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| Thank you, sir. He says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Okay. Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| Commissioner Frazier, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Just to kind of echo what Commissioner Beeler said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| that closing community roads impacts communities, good, bad, or ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| In this situation, as he stated, we've got very few options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| I've had conversations with Director Snowden, with some of the community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| and there really isn't a win-win here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| And that's really tough, because when you do close a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| you're cutting off pedestrians and bikes and residential cut-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| So, Director Snowden, is this a permanent close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| Would it be a permanent close on that side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:29| Commissioner Frazier, yeah, in its current configuration, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| Commissioner Beeler notes, I mean, the biggest problem with the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| is Luttrell Road and Old Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| and Tazewell Pike is everything converges so close together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| so there's very little throat depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| If we were to want to continue traffic along Old Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| we would want to move that several hundred feet, I guess, towards Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| I guess that would be to the south, maybe east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| Anyway, so I don't think necessarily long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| I think if we were to make improvements to Old Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| we wouldn't do it on existing right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| So I don't think it closes the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| If we do want to long-term, reopen that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| because we would have to acquire right-of-way from another landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| because really there's just no way as close as it is to Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| that the state would ever let us improve the road in its current right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| So it would be permanent in its current location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| but if there was another project that realigned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| then it could be open at another location further to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| I think where I'm coming from is that time and time again we see we make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| to put Band-Aid fixes on things to try to limp along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| and my concern is are we using our funding for a quick short-term fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| where we should really pursue those relationships with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| and trying to get those moved up on their list of priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| and if so, what's the time frame and really what's the reality of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| Is that something we'll see in two, three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| The mobility plan that the TPO has right now has no really mention of Tazewell Pike in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:32| so any large-scale improvement along Tazewell Pike that would modify this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| would be certainly many years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| However, I am working with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| and their traffic engineering folks are actually looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| they've done counts and analysis at Ridgeview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| and they're going to do a companion analysis at Carter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| So I think there could be a partnership with TDOT and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| much like we've seen in Commissioner Hill's district at Beaver Ridge at Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| where through support of this body and the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| that we have got projects to fix a location for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| So I think that would be something, although not directly impacted to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| could indirectly affect it because that's what we heard at the public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| was people wanted to avoid the intersection of Ridgeview and Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| So I think there is some good opportunities to potentially make some improvements there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| that would indirectly impact this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4053)|

| 1:11:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| It's my understanding that Knox County Rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| a majority of your staffing is from rural metro personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| It's my understanding that they have served some sort of notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| that I believe it's come February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| that they're no longer going to provide that staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| It's a little bit more than a yes or no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Yeah, yeah, please do, if you could elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| Okay, so we have a relationship with rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| where they were paying for nine full-time rescue technicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| that served all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| Three were stationed east, three north, three west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| Come February 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| those rescue technicians will be on rural metro engines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| So the only two paid people at Knox County Rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| are myself and our administrative assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| How are you able to run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| I mean, come February, how will you be able to run operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| with only two administrative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Rural metro will be continuing to handle motor vehicle accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| and they will handle it through rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Okay, so I guess I might call on Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| since you're on this committee or a member of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| I just learned about them saying they're not going to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| those nine full-time rescue techs come February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| so I guess where I'm going to, are we getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| are we approving funding that then is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| I don't understand how the relationship's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| It's the first time I've heard that we're approving funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| but they're going to kind of drop out after a certain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| Sure, if I could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| Yeah, yeah, please elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| I'll certainly pass the podium over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| For years, Knox County Rescue has had specialty teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| that perform specialty rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| So our understanding is that it's not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| The motor vehicle accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| which is the high frequency that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| rural metro will be handling that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| Rural metro has been handling that for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| They've been using our equipment, but it is their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| So they have been underwriting the motor vehicle accident rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| for Knox County for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| and we have been supplying the equipment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| So what about all the other stuff, cave rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| underwater rescue, all the specialty stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| As of right now, we're working with rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| This is a change that we were just made aware of late July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| So we're continuing to meet with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| to see what the relationship will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| But the specialty teams, it's our understanding now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| that we will still be providing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Mr. VanVate, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| When you all went through the, and this is a committee question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| as you went through the allocation of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| is this something you guys took into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| with the different staffing levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| It is, and I couldn't really add much to Ms. Green's summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| She, I think, summed it up nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| Rural metro has been assisting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| with what we would consider more conventional rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| vehicle extrication at motor vehicle crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| In 2022, it really simply makes more sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| for the fire service agencies to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| as part of their core mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| and the rescue squad will continue to serve in their capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| standing up specialty teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| There are types of rescue, high angle, swift water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| things like that, where it simply doesn't make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| to invest the time, training, personnel, and equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| across the board in all the fire agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| You might consolidate that in a rescue service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| So they'll continue to provide that role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| and we'll watch that evolve over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| as the committee does its work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| When you all went through the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| What's the funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| I'm trying to pull it up as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| The funding level for rescue squad this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| So that's 280...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| 283.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| So that's significantly less than years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Considerably, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| That's where I'm getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| You adjusted the funding to match the level of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| I just couldn't get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| couldn't get my glasses on before my fellow committee member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| Commissioner Dudley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| That's where I'm sort of getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Ms. Green explained it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| I just wanted to make sure we were sort of adjusting as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=4589)|

| 1:33:29| You have to have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| You have to have six votes to pass any resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| So this resolution fails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5620)|
| 1:33:47| Would the procedure then be to bring that up again next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| when we have, hopefully when we have 11 members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| Well, you can bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| You can do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| But what's happened is there's so much contention on this that the resolution itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| if you had two separate resolutions, you had a resolution for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| and a resolution for two years, it would pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| But you had them all rolled into one, and that resolution has failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| Now, if you want to make substitute motions to try to get it in line and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| so you can get it done, you can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| But right now you're in a conundrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| I'll make a substitute motion to split the nominations into two separate motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| as necessary for the clerk to renumber them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| and consider resolution appointing Mr. Manning to serve in the three-year capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| as a single motion to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| So the motion is to split the resolution into the three-year member as one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| and the two-year member as a second one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| If that motion passes, then it's treated as two separate new voting items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| Is there any discussion regarding the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:22| That was made properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| He also included in that the clerk would renumber that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| All those in favor of the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5731)|

| 1:36:03| I thought the motion was to split them into two separate...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5763)|

| 1:38:12| You're not a recognizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| I've been called out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| You're not recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| He sent an email out to say that he would do this afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| but he was asked twice, maybe three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| if he would follow what the County Commission Ordinance was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| and the Merit Council's bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| And he said he could not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| I just want everybody to have the golden record that that was what was said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| and that's the reason I will not vote for Mr. Weiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| I did receive Mr. Weiner's email like everybody did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| and I think that he explained what he was talking about when he sent that email to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| That makes me comfortable because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| we do have to follow state and federal law when we're setting up these committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| and so I'm very comfortable in the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| I also like the idea of being able to have an attorney sit on that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| after dealing with the issues that I personally dealt with for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| I think it's very helpful to have some legal expertise on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:30| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Director Buch, you are a member of your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| We'll have to swear in the new members to the Board of Directors for the Marriage System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| Do you see a conflict in swearing someone in that didn't assure that the ordinance itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:56| that it governed as under was legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| I'd like to defer that to the person who dealt with that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| former Law Director Mike Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| I don't even know if this is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:18| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| I'm not sure that microphone works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Would you restate your question one more time, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| As outlined by Commissioner Daley in last week's interview process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| I asked the question of the applicant or the nominee if he felt that the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:37| that this marriage system now sits under, which is essentially our local law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| was legal, and he was unable to say that it was and gave us an answer otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| And essentially when pressed, did he feel like it was a legal ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| and would he abide by it, could not give that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| If he were to become a member of this board and you were to swear him in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| how would you be able to do that as law director if you didn't feel the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| or do you just swear them in until they act otherwise in good faith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| The answer to that question is you swear them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| I don't know Mr. Weiner's mind or his heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| And if he takes the oath and he's pledging that he's going to follow the constitutional laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| of the state of Tennessee and the charter of Knox County and the laws thereof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| if he has a problem with following that, if he does not follow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| just like any officeholder who does not follow their oath of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| he's subject to an ouster proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| Hopefully he won't come to that, but that is each person who's appointed to an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| is required to take the oath whether they're elected or appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| That is within the wisdom of the electorate or the appointing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| If he takes the oath, it's his pledge that he's going to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| Thank you, Mr. Weiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| Mr. Weiner, as an attorney, has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| and the Constitution of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| And if he takes the oath to obey our charter, I believe that Mr. Weiner will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| And I'd like to publicly recognize him if I could do that. Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Mr. Weiner, could you explain your position on obeying the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| My position is that I will follow this ordinance provided that it complies with state and federal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:44| which includes the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, the laws of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| and the federal Constitution of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| That's required by our state constitution twice for any oath given to any person appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| or elected to any position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| I will be willing to make that oath, you know, and that's my position on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| I don't see any reason that this commission would doubt Mr. Weiner's abiding by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:19| So I would support Mr. Weiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| Thank you, Commissioner Lee. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Mr. Weiner, just your previous statement based upon whose interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| Our law director who represents Knox County or yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| His counsel is the same as anybody else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Say that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| I said the law director's opinion on this counts just as much as anybody else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| It's not law. His opinion is not law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| His opinion is not law, but he's the legal counsel for both Knox County and the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| I have an oath, a professional obligation to follow as well. You keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| I understand that, but when you serve on any board, if that board is governed by the laws of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:05| and the lawyer for Knox County and the lawyer for the merit system interprets it a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| are you saying that if you interpreted it a different way, you would not abide by it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| I have my conscience. I've got to stand on my conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| If I think something is wrong, I'll say it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| If I see something is right, I'll agree with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| We're going to agree on 99 percent of the stuff that comes before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| I don't see what the issue is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| Well, I think the issue stated in plain terms is that we have written in a very, very specific provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:38| into the ordinance that outlines that members that choose to volunteer to serve on this merit system board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:47| choose so by following a certain set of rules and guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| And some of those include the nature of being involved with political entities, political campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:59| political clubs, campaign shirts going out on door-to-door knocking, making donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| We've outlined it in order to strip out the amount of politics that is driven by decisions within a certain body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:15| And we went through a process for that. We went through a legal process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| We talked to our law director, our lawyer, researched it, and said that it was a perfectly legal way to write that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:28| This body adopted that, but you disagreed with that this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| and publicly said you don't believe that that provision of being to behave in an apolitical nature is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:39| So I think the real issue here is you're not able to say you'll abide by the ordinance as written, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:47| And so if this body appoints you to that merit system board and you walk in with a campaign shirt on and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| I don't believe it's legal, Mr. Law Director, I don't think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| I mean you stood here and said the law director is wrong, then you're going to be in a bind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| Somebody is going to send that to the Ethics Council, and we're going to be right back here putting somebody else on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| That's the issue is that you don't believe the ordinance is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| The issue is standing on principle. I know it's hard for you to believe that, but that's what the issue is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| No, no, it's a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| It's a matter of principle. I know a lot of people have difficulties with that, but that's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| But Mr. Warner, that's not the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| The question is this ordinance as directed by our law department, that is a legal ordinance that governs the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6386)|
| 1:46:34| will you abide by that legal ordinance in its full and its entirety as it is written today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:41| Provided it complies with the laws of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| Based upon whose interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| I believe the question has been asked and answered. I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6406)|

| 1:47:09| I don't think you can call for the question in the middle of a statement, but you can do that on the next turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:16| The question has been asked and answered, Mr. Larson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| I'm not sure how appropriate it is to continue to beat someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| What I'm simply asking of the nominee is if you don't – I think the issue here is if I agree to do something according to the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:33| but then I personally don't agree with it, then the law doesn't seem to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| And so, again, Mr. Moyer says you can swear somebody in, and if he doesn't comply with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| then you can file and we can write BRAC here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| But it's hard for me to believe that members of this body would pick somebody who says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| I don't believe in this law, so put me on there to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6473)|
| 1:48:03| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| I'd just like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| I believe that what Mr. Jay is saying, that the law department is never wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| And I believe that what Mr. Weiner is saying is in this situation where the law department said in the Gary Prince lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:25| that they would lose in the Martha Dooley hearing, the Chancellor Haggerty ruled it should go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| So there was a discrepancy there in the correct action that the county should go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:41| So I don't think that Mr. Weiner saying that he may disagree with the law department means that he's not going to abide by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:50| I'm saying he has his right to agree or disagree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| That's in and of a separate issue whether or not he'll obey the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6535)|
| 1:49:06| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6546)|

| 1:49:13| Mr. Weiner, if appointed, will you follow the rules of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6553)|

| 1:49:43| Will you follow those rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| I don't see any reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| I've not seen the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| I mean, if somebody wants to send me the rules, I'll have a look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| I don't think there would be a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-1?start=6597)|
