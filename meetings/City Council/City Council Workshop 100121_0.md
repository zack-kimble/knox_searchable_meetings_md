| 0:01:34| Oh, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| Partially here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| Thanks, everybody, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| Before we get into the meat of the workshop, I've got a couple real quick sort of process things to go over with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| First, I want to let, by way of framing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| I want to let folks know that the vast majority of City Council staff has been ill this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=112)|
| 0:02:00| which has put us behind on a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| And ideally, if we can be a little quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| Ms. Wilson has been one of those people who's been missing a lot of time, and I'm glad she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| And when it's over, don't ask her any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Let her go home and go to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| That will be helpful in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| I want to just remind people about a couple events coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| Some of these emails haven't gotten out because people have been sick and we're letting them rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| The training session on how we do codes and zoning enforcement is going to be on February 4th at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=148)|
| 0:02:37| and I think that is in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| Did I get that one right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| I wrote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| It may be the war room upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| We are going to have a workshop on the 10-year plan on February 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| That will be probably in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| No, that will be in the small assembly room next door, and that's actually going to be at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| We're going to start a little late because there are a few issues with MPC meeting and how it impacts CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| so we're going to try a 530 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| I want to remind folks that we have a budget retreat starting at 8 o'clock in the morning on February 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| Location is not set yet, but that will be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| We have a request for a workshop in April, kind of the middle of April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| on the CDBG, et cetera, consolidated plan that Madeline's office does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| and there will be some dates going out on email on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| Again, to remind everybody, there's a question of do we want to do this and then what are the dates that are good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| and those are two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| I want to warn people I can find lots of times to have workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| and people need to be clear if you don't want to do something to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| I also wanted to say that the email that was going out with all the jobs that we talked about at last dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| all the roles of council, one of our staff people who is ill is working on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| and because they're ill they are not working very hard on that this week, so that is not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| So that's moving a little slower, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| I wanted to say at the next dinner, which is the 9th of February, I want to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| I know Mr. Woodhull and Mr. Greave are going to talk about some visioning things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| and hopefully they can update us on what's happening with a plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| I want to come back with my recommendations about those jobs at that dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| and I'm hoping we'll have time to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| And I also want to give a try at doing Mr. Pavlis' idea of an agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| So we want to sunshine that meeting for the entire agenda and take a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| Mr. Swanson and I are going to sit down with Mr. Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| and talk about what he's learned at MPC where they do this model very effectively that we can try at our dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| So I want to give that a try, and if we've done it well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| I think we have a better sense of how often we want to do it again and what that means in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| That's my five cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Are there any other council members who would like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| The February 11th meeting about the 10-year plan, is that an official council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| or is that a briefing primarily for new members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Because I don't remember being surveyed on that as a workshop date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| It is primarily for new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| It is the 10-year plan, which is always a hotly debated subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| but I think that the gearing rather like the session on the 4th is more aimed at new folks, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Information is always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| I just wasn't clear whether the February 11th was an official workshop date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| or if it was more part of our briefing as we try to make sure that everybody is on the same page with information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| So it's an official workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| I think the consensus of all of us here on the front row is that it is a briefing targeted at new people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=368)|
| 0:06:17| but we will double-check that with John Lawler and make sure we're conveying that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| The other thing is, just a reminder to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| I think we all received an email from a constituent who was concerned about being able to hear the proceedings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| and she encouraged all of us to speak into the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| and particularly when we would turn to the left or the right to address someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| to continue to speak up so that folks who are watching at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| or are watching recorded archived sessions can hear all the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| I just wanted to mention to my colleagues and also the presenters that I have to leave in about 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| I had a previously scheduled meeting, so I'll be slipping out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Any other comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| If not, let me, before I turn it over to Joe Walsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| there's always a question at these things about how we do the questions we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| and we're all adults here, and our tradition is you have a question, you just sort of ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| Knowing that Mr. Woodhull has to leave and that Ms. Wilson is sick, I want to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| I want to ask folks to be thoughtful before they ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| Don't blurt out whatever comes to you like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Try and learn to do it the right way, and I will try as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| So let me turn it over to Director Walsh for a presentation on the Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| and Rec plan and our Parks and Rec Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Can you all hear me well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Joe Walsh, Director of the Parks and Recreation Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| Thanks, Council, for coming out this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| We're here to have a hopefully brief workshop, but it can be as long as you'd like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| We're open to questions when we're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Let's talk about the Parks and Recreation Greenway and Parks Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| which was developed with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| The process started in 2006, actually, January 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| So this has been a long four-year process, but it's been a very effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| and productive process, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| In January of 2006, Planning Commission came to Sam Anderson and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| and we talked about the possibility of doing a greenways plan because, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| it had been over a decade since the last one had been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| So we agreed that the city would work with the Planning Commission for a fee to develop an inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| of all current Parks and Recreation facilities and parks, and then they would do a citizen input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| and do some public series of public meetings to find out what people wanted to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| in the Parks and Recreation plan, and then they would develop a draft plan, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| go back to the public, get more public input, and finally develop this final plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| which is what we're considering this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| I appreciate you all approving this on the first reading, last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| and hope it will also get approved next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| One unique aspect about this plan from any previous plan that's been developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| this was a joint plan between the city of Knoxville and Knox County Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| That's the first time that's happened, I believe, and, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| we felt like it made a lot of sense from the standpoint of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| the citizens of Knoxville and Knox County use the parks, use our facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| recreation centers, and I don't think they really care whether it was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| and maintained by the city or by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| And, frankly, there's a lot of overlap there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| So a lot of people who live close to a county park and may have great resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| but may not have access to a city park, but still it needs to be considered together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| in order for it to be an effective plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| So we decided on the front end to work with the county to develop this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| We held a series of public meetings starting in September of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| We held actually eight public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| which was very well attended by probably 100 or 200 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| who came to hear about what our ideas were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| And then we continued to have a series of public meetings throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| and I'm sure several of you all attended those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| We had Chihuly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| We met at schools and libraries and really got really good input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| and feedback about issues like what they liked about the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| what they don't like about the parks and greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| and what they'd like to see happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| And we took all that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| And the Planning Commission took that information, assimilated it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| and made it part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| In addition to that, we also did a survey, an online survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| that was developed by the Planning Commission and got really good response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| hundreds if not thousands of responses to the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| So once again, that was another tool and mechanism that we were able to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| to help make this plan comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| We finally developed the draft plan, took it back out to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| and once again got more feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Had another meeting at the Expo Center, which was well attended as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| Mike Carberry presented the draft plan, got feedback then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| got feedback over the next few months actually from different individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| neighborhood associations, groups that wanted to put their two cents worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| So from that standpoint, it was very comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Now we finally got to the point we made those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| We continue to make changes, and Mike will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| we've made changes up until the last minute on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| So it's been a very fluid method process, but now we are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| and Planning Commission approved this plan last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| We're asking council to approve it next Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| and then County Commission will consider it at their next meeting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| So at that point, we'll have a finalized plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| When Mike is finished making the presentation, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| we asked you if you have questions about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Please take the opportunity to ask those questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Also, Parks and Recreation doesn't get the floor very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| We find ourselves sometimes to feel like the stepbrother when competing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| police and fire and public service and engineering for our five minutes of fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| So if you have questions in general about anything related to Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| and Recreation after Mike gets through with his presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| and after we field those questions about the plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| I'd be glad to answer questions about the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| because I know most of you are new council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| and I have worked with some of you in other capacities over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| but it's a large department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| and what we do is a lot different from what we may think as far as programming-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| and facilities we're responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| and what we do to improve the quality of life for the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| So at this point, I know everybody wants to get out of here fairly quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| so I'll turn this over to Mike Carberry and let him make the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| While Mike's coming up, we have one more quick council thing we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Council rules do not provide automatically for public forum at workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| so I'm going to go ahead and rule that without objection we're going to add public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| if folks are good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| At the end of the presentation, the end of the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| there will be a chance for anyone in the public who wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| I don't know if we have a sign-up sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| I think there's a sign-up sheet over on this side if you're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| We'll also open the floor if there are people who want to talk at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Mr. Carberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| I'm Mike Carberry, comprehensive planning manager with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| Mark Donaldson, the executive director, is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| and one of my colleagues, Liz Albertson, is back on your right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=814)|
| 0:13:44| Let's go to the next slide, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| This is the first time that the city and county have a comprehensive park plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| We have comprehensive transportation plans for the transportation and road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| This is an update of several documents, including the county greenway plan, the city greenway plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| the county park plan, and rolls all those into one document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| Presently, there's about 6,000 acres of park land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| That includes the city, the county, the town of Farragut, such state resources as House Mountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| such resources as Seven Islands Wildlife Refuge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| This plan makes recommendations just for the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| but we do acknowledge the other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| We involve the town of Farragut in the preparation of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| The graphic that you see here is from a 1929 document, the general plan for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=883)|
| 0:14:51| It was a very far-reaching plan and proposed lots of parks throughout central Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| Harlan Bartholomew, who did it, came back right before World War II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| and proposed Sequoia Park along the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| That was one of the heydays of the first of the park movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| TVA helped a lot as it came on with Concord Park, a lot of open space resources throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=912)|
| 0:15:22| Then we had such parks as Morningside with urban renewal days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Then over the last 20 years through both mayors, Ash and Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| there has been an expansion of the park system markedly within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| Right now we have a little bit more than 400,000 people in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| We're growing steadily, and by 2030 we can expect over half a million people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=948)|
| 0:15:57| I think the adage they're not making land anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| and setting aside resources to build the community with parks and open spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| is one premise of this plan to meet future needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| Interestingly, in that 1929 plan, they looked at where Knoxville was in relation to the sort of pure cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| We looked at that again in the early 90s to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| we really need to start a park acquisition program that's substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| The city took that to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Several large parks, Holston River Park, Victor Ash Park, Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| were part of the realization of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| The National Recreation and Park Association is the lead organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1009)|
| 0:16:58| that provides park advice to cities and counties across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| It's long been recognized that there's a lot of different type of park resources in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| We look at spaces for urban parks, whether they be courts or squares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| or small neighborhood parks, passive recreation places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| the more traditional active recreation places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| and then natural areas including the urban wilderness and historic corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1045)|
| 0:17:33| Neighborhood parks, if there's one great need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| particularly in the suburban areas of the city and throughout the county, it's neighborhood parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1058)|
| 0:17:46| These are parks within walking distance that just provide some open space to the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| throughout that growing suburban area and the urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| Typical facilities would include some open space, playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| and then they should really be geared to the population and the ages and interests of that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| The next building block of the park system are community parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| This is another what is termed a close to home park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| They're within driving distance, and they're the kinds of places that conventionally have been the places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| for the soccer games, the softball games, the baseball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| Anywhere from five to, I mean, from 10 to 100 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| A couple of examples would be the Holston River Park, and that's a really good example here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1115)|
| 0:18:46| We worked with Sam Anderson when he was park director to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| rather than divvy up all the parks into ball field here, ball field here, ball field here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| let's create open spaces that can have multiple uses within parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| and that philosophy is carried on in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| The parks department in the city did that in the case of Victor Ash Park and Holston River Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| District parks, Victor Ash, Lakeshore are two prominent examples, and these are very large parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1154)|
| 0:19:24| They're sort of the destination for league games and those kinds of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| And finally, the regional park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| In part, the state provides some of this function through the state park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| Within our area, we have Concord Park, House Mountain, which is operated in conjunction with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| Then we have large refuges that are being set aside like Seven Islands Wildlife Refuge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| that essentially serve a regional population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| The plan talks about natural area conservation, which are connections between the major parks are a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| the urban wilderness trail, and joining all those pieces together is an example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1204)|
| 0:20:13| House Mountain doesn't have anything but a trail up the mountain, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| We're saying let's look to a little bit broader set of uses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| The one area that really needs, and this is not in the city, but the Copper Ridge area in north Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| can sort of form the last quadrant of a large regional park or natural area, and that's recommended in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1227)|
| 0:20:37| Sports complexes, the Castle Park is the foremost example in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| They're not only for local residents to participate in games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| but they're economic generators from the standpoint that you're bringing in lots of sports teams for tournament weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| and then you have spinoffs in the restaurant and hotel businesses that are worthwhile for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1256)|
| 0:21:06| Recreation centers, the city, back in urban renewal days in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| put together a lot of small little recreation centers, but there are some very good ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| Christianberry, Dean Hill readily come to mind, and they're the indoor places for year-round activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1276)|
| 0:21:25| the places for the basketball games in the winter, the dance classes, senior citizen activities, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1285)|
| 0:21:36| Now, on this particular slide, it's on one of the pages of your plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1296)|
| 0:21:46| I just want to point out a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Going back to this idea of close-to-home parks, at the bottom of the column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| the National Recreation and Park Association recommend roughly six acres of close-to-home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1315)|
| 0:22:03| that's neighborhood and community parks per 1,000 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| And you can see the city is pretty much nudging up against that minimum recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1326)|
| 0:22:15| The county is way behind in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| But then if we begin to look at the acreage in some of the sectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1337)|
| 0:22:26| you can see that the south county has a whole lot of acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| but that's because of the setting aside of the Iams Nature Center and the Hasty Park and those kinds of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1353)|
| 0:22:42| So it really has quite a few acres per 1,000 population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| Central City has a heck of a lot of parks at 436, but also has the largest population by far of any of the sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1367)|
| 0:22:57| There's a chapter on recreation facilities, and working with the parks departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| we looked at the need for both traditional, the sports fields, the swimming pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| We also looked at newer pastimes that came up on our radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| and what people wanted as far as splash pads and skate parks and dog parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| very popular in the last handful of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| We've made recommendations by quadrant of where those facilities might go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| Greenways is one other component, and I think we all kind of know greenway when we see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| but consider that it's not only the trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| it is the protection and conservation of the natural resources in that corridor that are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1425)|
| 0:23:55| Going back to some of the survey results, between talking to school kids and the public and hearing back from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1435)|
| 0:24:04| there was over 1,000 people that were involved in the drafting of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| And if we look at somewhat satisfied and not satisfied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| we can see that there probably is some room for improvement in the park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| And I think we see that most, and to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| with the idea that the greenway system should be a foremost priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| We kept hearing that over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| And this slide reflects that, and I think we're well on our way to expanding that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| South Waterfront certainly will be a great addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| The slide on the right, as was known, is a crush and run trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| In other words, it's very fine gravel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| and we feel that that kind of surface can be used in certain circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| A good example would be the Smoky Mountain Railroad right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| If that's ever set aside, it's a general grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| So you can reduce the expense of trail building and still provide that kind of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1508)|
| 0:25:17| That particular one is on a TVA property along the Norris area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1517)|
| 0:25:25| This is just a summary of what the major desires were through the meeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1525)|
| 0:25:33| and you can see both traditional and some of those newer activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| So now we're going to get into the various recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| In the back, we have a map of the overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| You have sector maps, but when you compress them all together, you can see the system as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| and I'm going to go through a few slides to get at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| In this particular one, you see in the wide, light brown, the proposed greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1560)|
| 0:26:10| In the green is the existing greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| This is an aggressive proposal, if you will, but it's over a 30-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| and is the formula for beginning to work on establishing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| and that can be done through a lot of different processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| It can be done through grant processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| The easements can be set aside at the time of purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| We have agreements with the developers as far as setting aside an easement on occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| and I want to point out one example that is really somewhat coming before you in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| I couldn't help but make a connection between the potential purchase of the land on the French Broad River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| for the Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| MPC had a zoning case a few years ago where an easement was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| The recommendation for it was a condition of the rezoning to put a greenway trail along the river there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| and we brought this to the parks director's attention that it probably should be a consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| when the city actually acquires it to at least get a 20-foot trail easement in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| so we can begin to realize that portion of the plan for the French Broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| It would be an easier way to do that than just passing it on to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| and then having to go backwards on trying to come to that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| Cemeteries and trails, it's interesting, like Old Gray and some of those places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| back in the mid-1800s when those kind of cemeteries became in vogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| people used to go out in their carriages and ride through the cemeteries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| just because it was a pleasant experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| and a trail along one side of a cemetery could be an asset for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| You'll see also on that map there was little dotted lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| and this was one of the major additions since the final public review was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| well, let's look upon greenway connectors between these major greenway systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| and the connectors virtually always follow the street system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| This concept goes along with the complete streets policy that you all have adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| and in the next slide we'll see what some of the bike pedestrian alternatives are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1718)|
| 0:28:47| with a complete streets program or with these greenway connectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| We're just saying let's identify the major ones as part of the greenway plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| A side path is the example on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| A designated bike lane and sidewalk is an example on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| What we're saying is when there's a road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| let's look to this and choose one of the methods that makes the best sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| at the time of road development and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| The sector plan has locations, generalized locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| They're not site-specific for community, neighborhood, district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| and regional parks in the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| What you see here in green are the existing parks within the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| You'll see that the lion's share is in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| and you can see with the hexagonal-shaped brown dots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| we're calling for quite a few neighborhood parks, less in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| but that's to get that distribution of the smaller parks within neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| throughout the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| I think each of you probably would have an interest in one of the city sectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| so I'm just going to do some highlights of some of the major recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| for each sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Greenway connections in the central city, one of the foremost along First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| and Second Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| The use of public resources that are already out there that wouldn't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| acquisition is one thought that we have in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| And where you see the dark brown parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| they're already in the public domain, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Rural high school, the Oakwood School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| and we're suggesting that rather than acquire new land for certain parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| let's look to some of these other resources that can be value-added for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| community as far as development around those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| East city sector has a couple of really good resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| The Holston River Park, that's the UT farm across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| We didn't make a recommendation that the whole island be taken over as a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| but it could be a very nice natural area with a loop trail around it that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| could go out and bird watch or fish or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| It's right next to the existing Holston River Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| There is a recommendation on Chillhally Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| When you go by that south side, south of Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| that used to be ball fields back in the 1920s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| Kentucky played Tennessee in football there in 1907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Who won?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Oh, Tennessee, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| It was used for those kinds of activities for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| and now it boils down to a few times a year when it's used as stuff associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| with the fairgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| We see it having probably some uses that could also serve fairground purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| but it could also serve the neighborhoods out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| Prosser Road Park is another example of an existing public resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| It's city-owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| It could be one of the future parks within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1942)|
| 0:32:32| This is the North City Sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| A couple years ago you adopted the North City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Virtually all these ideas were in that particular plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| One of the major recommendations came out of this work was to make better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| connections down to Tommy Shumpert Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| which would be out in the county just north of the Sturkey Hills Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| or to the east of the Sturkey Hills Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| And then as the neighborhoods out along White's Creek in that area developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| we need to start setting aside some neighborhood parks in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| and in the older parts in Skip and Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| Again, this was one of those situations where suburban growth took place so fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| and people were concerned about ball fields for kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| but it didn't take into account within walking distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| and people just drove everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| We're looking back and getting more things within walking distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| The obesity rate of kids in Knox County is 40%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| and walking and getting close to home resources is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| Northwest City, that holds true for this sector as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| Quick suburban growth and those smaller parks were not set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| These are all locations that have open space within the generalized vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| that it would be possible to acquire some land in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| You can imagine what this sector would have been like without Victor Ashe Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| which was one of the major accomplishments of the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| And then the South City, it's pretty dramatic how much parkland there is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| but with Legacy Parks, the city and Legacy Parks is well on the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| to connecting the large green spaces that's recognized in this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| through a series of greenways and, again, a few neighborhood parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| And then finally, West City, two of the flagship parks of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| or the city and the county for that matter, are Sequoia Park and Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| Lakeshore Park being realized about 10 years ago are in this sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| The major emphasis here is connectivity, particularly along branches of Fourth Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| and back to some of those other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| Implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| The current subdivision regulations say in regard to parks, open space, and schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| the Metropolitan Planning Commission may set aside 10% of a subdivision for park and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2112)|
| 0:35:21| That's rarely exercised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| It's usually done through voluntary compliance, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| This particular trail and open space system is out in Covered Bridge out in West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| but it's an absolutely beautiful site with a nature trail and then an open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| for anything you'd want to play there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| But it's part of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| More things like this could probably happen with a little rework of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| Real estate transfer tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| The state of Tennessee has a pittance of a tax that goes toward parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| and wetlands acquisition across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| I'm sure you've heard of rather big purchases over time, especially up on Cumberland Plateau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| What we discuss in the text is that let's look at some of the metropolitan areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| and have a new visit to that legislation where some earmarks might be given to the metropolitan areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2179)|
| 0:36:28| I think it's logical that most of the real estate transactions in the state happen in the metropolitan areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| The largest absorption of land for urban and suburban development has happened in the metropolitan areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| but portions of that tax don't necessarily come back to realize such things as expansions of House Mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| or the work of the Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I think some programs could be put together in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| The city has a Greenway Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| It was started by Mayor Ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| It's not like the tree board where they offer advice back to council or the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| The county does have a park board which does perform that function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| Most places have a city park board which reviews a plan, reviews the site plans for improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2233)|
| 0:37:21| is active in the capital improvement program as it's developed each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| and the plan acknowledges that that might be a good thing to look at in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| Bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| A lot of cities use bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| Parks a lot of times in conjunction with other issues to fund the improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| and that's another thing that I think Director Walsh is interested in pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| It doesn't all have to be done by the city nor the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| There's corporate sponsors out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Clayton provided the land for a park out in Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| Legacy Parks took donations from everybody from the grassroots effort to the corporate level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| and it's another great vehicle that's really come on strong during the course of this plan preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2292)|
| 0:38:21| Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| There's a role there as far as regional sporting events and their involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| And then the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Probably not going to have too many new schools necessarily in most of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| where some of the areas are annexed, you very well might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| In that case, if there's a new school site that needs to be selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| it would be wise to look at a school park combination where you have playground space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| or field space that can be used both by the school kids and by the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| Secondly, the surplusing of schools where they could serve a park resource is recognized here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| Some places keep that on their radar where those spaces are recaptured for recreation use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| Oak Ridge has done a really good job in that regard of creating neighborhood parks at their old elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| Then in the appendices of this document are several programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| We put it back there because they're going to be updated easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| and there's recommendations on park acquisition, on the greenway priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| We know we can't fund all those at one time, but we should at least know where the routes should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| This is a generalized plan that's pretty broad-brushed as far as the corridors and to get on with routing studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| so you have a good idea of where those could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Then approving permits to existing resources or using existing resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| Two examples here would be rural high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| It's sat like that for, gosh, 10, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| Rails-to-trails programs, that's the right-of-way going up Second Creek Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| parallel to I-275 in Second Creek that the rails are out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| One could take a bike right now and ride down there, so there's such opportunities as those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| It was adopted by MPC, and you will be considering it on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| and it's on county commission's agenda for January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| So at this point, questions of Joe, Mark, and me, we'll be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2440)|
| 0:40:52| Mr. DellaVope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Yes, Mr. Carberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| You mentioned that we have some provision for MPC requiring up to 10 percent of the land for parks for some developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2456)|
| 0:41:07| Do we have any incentives in our zoning or our plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| so that if someone wanted to have maybe higher density of the structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| but would leave green space around a development so that you'd have the best of both worlds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| that is some of the land would be left in a natural state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| Would we encourage that in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| The requirement in the subregs is MPC may, and it's not a shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| So that's not self-fulfilling, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| But a lot of times, and I'll give you a couple of examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| if we have a hilly portion of the city or county that comes up for planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2504)|
| 0:41:51| we'll oftentimes give a heads up at the time of the rezoning request to save the natural attributes of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2511)|
| 0:41:59| That's not necessarily putting it in the public domain, but it is saving the natural attributes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| There are a couple of the zoning districts, traditional neighborhood development and town center in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| that a particular portion of the development has to be set aside for park and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2531)|
| 0:42:19| Danny Mayfield Park over in Mechanicsville Commons is an example of what was realized through that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| What I'm thinking of, so that the development becomes self-sustaining in the sense of people who live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| would then have a place to go out and walk and recreate right on the property rather than doing what we do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| which is drive to a park or drive to an entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| So you may do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| Is there any plus for the developer so he wants to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| I mean, can you make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| There's definitely what we call value added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| There's a gentleman or a professor out of Texas A&M that's sort of the expert on that nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2572)|
| 0:43:00| Mark, what is his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| John Crompton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| And he has studied the effect of parks on the value of properties next to it in cases across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2584)|
| 0:43:15| and we're sort of reflecting that in some of our hillside work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| You know, anecdotally, you could look at a place like Sequoia Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| where everybody's within pretty good walking distance or pretty easy walking distance of Sequoia Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| and the value from that is certainly something that's an asset to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| not only in terms of economic value as far as taxation but in terms of recreation value as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| Ms. Rowdy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| This question is for Director Walsh, and you indicated that anything was open to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| So I had a question from a constituent today about the timeline of the downtown dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| There's a lot of pent-up demand for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Can you give us a construction update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| I spoke to them this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| They're well under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| If the weather cooperates, we hope to have it open by the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| They've purchased the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| It's been purchased, not installed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| A lot of the preliminary work, the underground work's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| So even with the cold and wet weather we've had the last few weeks, they've made slow, steady progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| We've actually got an event coming up on February 13th called Mardi Gras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| and we would love to be able to have it open at the time that that event takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| because we're going to have hundreds of dogs coming downtown to be part of this dog parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| if you're not aware of that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| I have a question for either one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| The cost factor to expand and the greenways, is there an idea roughly of what it would cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2682)|
| 0:44:52| There is an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Unfortunately, the cost of doing greenways is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| We work closely with our civil engineering department with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| They're doing a good job of giving us pretty much good cost estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| when we identify a particular greenway that we want to look at constructing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| On an annual basis, we submit a request to the state for funding for enhancement money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| that we use to build a lot of our greenways over the years, and that cost keeps going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| Usually, we're looking at, depending on the lay of the land and whether the bridges are required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| at least $200,000 or $300,000 to do a mile of greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| It is not inexpensive to build a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| As there's less and less federal funds available to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| we've seen that trend the last few years, there's fewer dollars available and the costs keep going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| So, while we were doing a great job 10 years ago building a mile, two miles every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| that figure has been decreasing, and I think we, like Mike mentioned earlier, funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| that's going to be a key to future development of greenways is how we can pay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| We're going to use city capital money, special assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| tapping into other resources that aren't available currently, private donations, partnerships with corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| There's a lot of different options, but right now, that is a major stumbling block for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| I have one other question about the East Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| I think I saw on there about Walter P. Teller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Where is that proposed or where is it existing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| I know working with KCDC, I know there's been recent activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| probably, I don't know if Mike included this because that's only happened in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| I think Walter P. is looking at making a significant change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| and I think KCDC has committed to us that they will help us when that redevelopment takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| help us develop some park space in that part of that new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| Oh, I see. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Mr. Trudello, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| In following up on what Councilman Brown said, we have opportunities in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2815)|
| 0:47:05| it seems like, to partner with folks like KUB when they're doing this sewer work down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| which tends to be down by the streams and in the lower areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| and they will clear an area to put their pipes and stuff underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| Is there some opportunity for a partnership where they can essentially prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| what would be a future greenway as they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| and can't we capitalize on that in terms of surface materials that they might use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| in putting the surface back together so that we could be, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| walking over their pipe and increasing the number of miles with a partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| that's doing the heavy equipment work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| Certainly, I think there's a definite possible partnership as they do that work, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| I think it's a matter of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| In fact, I think recently all this conversation we've been having about tree trimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| and there seems to be a better cooperation between the city and KUB about that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| and I think the same thing could happen if it was brought to their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| I know 10, 15 years ago we were having some similar problems with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| TDOT, they were totally oblivious to the fact that there was opportunity to build greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| as they did road improvements or new road construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| and I think they've learned and they've changed their method of operation over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| and I think KUB, if we establish that relationship and made it clear to them what our intents were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| and as long as this area fell within the area that we were actually looking at building a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| I think they would hopefully work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| All right, and the second part of the question, I guess, has to do with when we go to community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| and talk to neighborhood leaders, almost everyone says we want sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| We want some way to get around, and I know that sidewalks are much more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| I've heard numbers, and I guess Steve King's in the background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| but people talk about a million dollars a mile to build a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| so in comparison, your greenway figure of $200,000 or $300,000 might substitute for the curb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| and gutter and concrete work that a sidewalk takes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| and couldn't you get more of that neighborhood connectivity with trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| even those stone trails that we saw in one of the examples of this line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Stone trails or even asphalt trails are, in our experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| definitely less expensive than doing the concrete sidewalks, so there is a cost savings there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| and we don't necessarily have to have greenways following the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| We can cut through property and have shortcuts from a school to a park or a park to a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| so there are certainly some opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| and some benefits to doing greenways versus sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Have you considered dirt trails like the Forest Service uses in the Smoky Mountains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| Yeah, I think basically what Councilman Brown asked about cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| that's one thing we're looking at more, so the soft surface trails that Mike mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| doing dirt trails, mulch trails, chat trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| simply because it is much less expensive to do than building the concrete or asphalt trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| It's just getting the money and getting the resources and getting the plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| One thing, unfortunately, it's like any planning for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Planning greenways, it's a long, drawn-out process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| If we were to start today, start the planning for a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| between acquisition and planning and design and funding and construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| and you're looking at several years, four or five years at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| to do a greenway from beginning to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| So it is a process that we've got to be moving slowly but steadily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| in order to add those miles and make those connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| I'm going to ask a question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| Just following up on that, Mike Carberry talked about routing planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| and then Mr. DellaVoppe talked about taking advantage of opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| How many of the greenways do we know where they're going where we can say to KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| you're building something here, and we're going to put a greenway here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| eventually do this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| How much of it do we have that kind of specificity down on where the routes are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| We have some good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Of course, we always take advantage of opportunities as they arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| Sometimes it may not fall exactly within the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| but if somebody puts it before us, we'll jump on the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| I think the great thing about this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| and once Council adopts it, assuming Council adopts this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| then we have this document in place and we can sit down with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| or sit down with other entities and say, okay, here's the long-term plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| Here's where we're looking at going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| What can you tell us that you're doing that may coincide with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| and how can we work together to help make this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| Because that's certainly a significant cause is acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| So if there's public property, whether it's Knoxville, City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| Knox County, KUB, TVA, that's what we want to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| Mr. Pavlis, thanks for waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| I was just curious what the cost of maintenance was annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| for the parks and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| Greenway, all our facilities, including greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| are maintained by our public service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| but I can tell you that greenways, for what we have, 40 miles of greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| the cost is fairly insignificant in relation to other facilities like ball fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| or tennis courts or recreation centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| We've got a 10-foot wide asphalt trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| We go through there and blow it off, you know, once or twice a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| We mow grass on the five-foot side of either greenways traditionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| So it's, you know, I don't have a dollar figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| but it is very affordable in comparison with other parks and recreation entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| And then like recreational facilities, I mean, I know they, I guess we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| it's subsidized, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| I mean, I know there's cost of being leagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| Yeah, well, we spend a considerable amount of money for umpires, officials, utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3165)|
| 0:52:53| We partner, if you want to talk about athletics for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| we help, we work with 11 different recreation commissions throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| you know, Inskip, Fountain City, South Knoxville, East Knoxville, Rocky Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| West Bearden, and mostly all those commissions are run by volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| They don't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| They do it because they love the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| They love the sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| What we provide is we provide the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| We help maintain the facilities, mow the grass, pay the utility bills, fix the fences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| pay the parking lots, make sure the restrooms are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| And what the commissions do as partnering with us is they raise the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| they buy the uniforms, they recruit the kids, they find the coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| they organize the leagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| We pay for the umpires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| We pay for the field crews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| So it is an expense, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| We spend on an annual basis just for our part-time salaries for umpires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| scorekeepers, the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| We spend well over half a million dollars just for those salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| And our utility bill citywide is in excess of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| Mr. Dellivere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Do we have any programs where we might partner with Eagle Scouts or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| if we're going to build sort of an informal trail where they can put in some sweat equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| and get things done with kind of the manpower that doesn't cost us money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| We work a lot with volunteer groups and scout troops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| We get calls on a fairly regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| I think it must be something in the scout manual, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| call your Parks and Recreation Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| because they're always calling us saying we want to do a project, here's our project idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| We've had them, for example, in Sequoia Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| we had a young man build a concrete pad to put a picnic table on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| because his sister was in a wheelchair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| and he wanted to build an accessible parking lot and an accessible picnic table for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| So that was his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| They've rebuilt bridges along our greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| We've been very fortunate to work with a lot of different volunteer groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| I know we work with neighborhood associations, businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| Home Depot on our annual basis comes out and does a great cleanup effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| At Morningside Park, just this last weekend, we had a big cleanup at Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| It was done by all volunteers in recognition of Martin Luther King Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| So we have a really good partnership with different groups that allow us to get a lot of work done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| at little or no cost to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Can they access this information on KGIS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| In other words, these maps overlay on existing turf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| Or will they when you get it adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| The layer of existing parks that's in this plan is already in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| So if one wants to see where the parks are, that is a layer within KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| The plan, we can figure out a way to get that in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| We need to be able to say to somebody that's in a potentially developing area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| please consider this greenway or that type of idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| So they would be aware of its location or proposed location as they plan their project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| And the locations, again, are generalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Some people go, oh, my God, they're putting a park on my parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| But, you know, that's not how the map, and there's a note to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| It's in that general vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| I want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| There are a lot of people downtown who live downtown, and other than the World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| and you just mentioned Morningside Park, which is relatively close, but in this new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| is there any thought given to anything for people who are downtown that would be relatively close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| You may have already covered that, and I guess that's your central city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| One of the concepts within the plan is a series of green belts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| or rings around various communities, and that certainly is part of the concept for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| If we realize a greenway all the way down to Nalin and the existing greenway there along Second Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3415)|
| 0:57:03| and one down to First Creek, one can also have at least a greenway connector through the Old City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| that one could jog or walk around the overall downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| The plan does recognize such things as Market Square as one of the kinds of leisure resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| There's not a whole lot of land in downtown proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| but we do recognize these other opportunities just next to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3447)|
| 0:57:36| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| I just handed out a sheet I put together today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| Like I said earlier, it's sometimes not really clear on what exactly Parks and Recreation does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| This is some facts and figures from 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| We're in the process of gathering up some data to look at what we've been doing the last 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| and it really gives you a feel for sort of the number of parks, tennis courts, golf courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| kids that participate in sports, kids that participate in our after-school program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| our summer playground program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| We have 16 recreation centers that we operate out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| and I think we do an excellent job providing various programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| We have a craft center that, if you'll look at the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| the statistics say we had 320 classes offered last year just in that one facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| So this is something, you know, you can see the number of people who use our greenways there at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| the number of people who are using our pools, both indoor and outdoor pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| So we've got a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| We've got a lot of people using our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| We really feel like we contribute a great deal to the quality of life of the people that live in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| and thanks to your support, we continue to be able to do a lot of these things that aren't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| you know, money-making ventures, but they certainly do provide a great asset to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Turn your light on, Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Red button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| No, that's that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| How do we compare citywide with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| or how do we compare with our department with other cities of similar size in terms of what we have for the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3556)|
| 0:59:26| in terms of parks and impacts and figures like you have here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| How do we compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| We hold our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Like Mike pointed out, you know, acreage-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| we're a little under in acreage of green space, park space per thousand residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| We're probably behind cities like Asheville or Charlotte or Nashville in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| But greenways, I'll match our greenway systems against any city in the southeast as far as miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| and we've done a lot of mileage in the last 15, 20 years there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| Recreation centers, frankly, the last time we built a recreation center was 1977,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| that was Christenberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| We have 16 recreation centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Most of them were built in the 50s and 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| So from that respect, I think we're a little behind as far as keeping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| If you'll go to some of those cities, especially medium-sized cities like Murfreesboro, Gatlinburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, they have these huge facilities, 30,000, 40,000 square feet with gymnasiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| three or four gymnasiums and indoor swimming pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| And so it just really depends on what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| Golf courses, tennis courts, I think we do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| Athletic, I think we do real well in athletics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| There was a period of time in the 50s and 60s that Knoxville had a recreation director who had a passion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| for baseball, football, basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| So we have quite a few sports like that available, so I think we hold our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| But overall, to answer your question, I think we do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| We could always do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| I hope to do better in the future, but that always comes down to funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| and that's the way we rely on you guys to help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| I have one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| I think it's a good thing that the city and county have been working together on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| I think that's a good example of efficiency, and thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| The county is easy to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Doug Battelle is a great director, and we've been able to do a lot of things together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| and I have to see us doing more and more of that in the future because it is an economy of scale sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| and we can certainly save on resources and utilize and borrow people, borrow equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| So that works out well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| If nobody on council has any comments, nobody actually signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| but I do want to open it up to anybody in the public who does want to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| We always love hearing from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| You have to state your name and address for the record, as I think you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| I'm William Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| 505 Hollywood Drive, born and raised in the Pond Gap community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| and president of the Pond Gap Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| I'd like to thank everyone for the hard work that went into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| We've got two areas of concern, though, in the Pond Gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| At the various expo meetings and surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| we've requested that a park be established on the pond property on Hollywood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| and we did not see that on the map up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| That has us concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Now, many of you might remember the MPC's Bearden Village Plan about ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| The MPC, which we thank them very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| they included our idea in that Bearden Village Plan, which was adopted by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| And we need to have that on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| We're also trying to work with some private foundations to get some funding for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| Of course, we'd like to work with the city in dealing with the landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| Maybe we can purchase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| I think on the map they showed something about a park at Pond Gap School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| Well, they're getting a lot of new buildings there, and they have a little wooded area left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| and you probably wouldn't want to do anything there except maybe a nature trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| Also what concerns us is about the greenways in the Pond Gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| On the map, we show one going on paper mill from Coleman east up to Liberty Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| We can't tell if it's that along Paper Mill Road itself or which side of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| We'd like to coordinate that with some of the historic sites that we're planning on showcasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| Many of you might wonder why Paper Mill Road is called Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| It was named after a paper mill that ran by Third Creek from 1830 to 1880.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| Well, we recently posted a historic marker along Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| Now, it's not at Third Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| It's down near Coleman, and you might wonder why it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| Well, because T-Mobile is going to put up a cell tower, and they paid for the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| But there are about seven or eight other historic sites in that area that we'd like to showcase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| So I'm just wondering, will this plan allow working with the community to put the plan, the trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| in a certain area that would showcase that history?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| Also, too, if you try running this trail along the interstate on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| we're in negotiations with TDOT to put up noise barriers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| Now, we're agreeable on two accounts with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| They're effective, and it would work, but no money as yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| So we would not want one plan to interfere with the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| The second topic is a greenway on Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| I can't tell from the map up there if you want to run it down Hollywood from Paper Mill to Southern or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| We'd like to see the sidewalk on Hollywood from the school to run under the interstate up to the pond property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| We do have problems if you want to put a greenway down the rest of Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| You have the houses so close to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| I think you ran into the same problem on Southern, the greenway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| That's why they didn't put them on the south side of Southern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| But I'm hoping that this is a general idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| If you do want to run the greenways in the pond gap community, can we be very flexible on where they'll be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| That's what we're very much interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Mr. Carbo, you want to respond to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| You're right here helping me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| I'm going to keep these two pages out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| By the way, thank you for making our area bigger than what we claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| We appreciated your comments during the course of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| The concepts that you just spoke about are reflected in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| We have a greenway along Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| It happens to be in the dividing line between the West City and the Northwest that come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| And then when you go to the Northwest city sector, you have we recognize that there should be a neighborhood park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| and a natural area where the pond is at the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| And the paper mill bluff greenway is within the right-of-way generally of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3951)|
| 1:05:59| It's one of the stimulus projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| It was funded originally with the I-40 improvements but was back burners, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3964)|
| 1:06:13| But I believe that's going forward through stimulus funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| and that trail will be probably one of the first things to be realized in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| What side that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| That's on the north side, right, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| It kind of goes to my question of routing, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| The paper mill bluff greenway is on the north side of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Let me just say it's this pond gap greenway, which looks like it runs on Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| Oh, no, that's north of Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| I understand where that is then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| By the way, just real quick for future reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| you're going from Third Creek west to where the Earth Fair site is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| That was the old home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| The Knoxville drive-in and from the railroad tracks north to just short of Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| We didn't want to infringe on the Lowness property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| but I think that pond gap greenway is maybe a little bit north of that, which we'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| We'll annex that part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| And also, too, I understand that Mr. Greave is an excellent architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| We're going to call on you to help us with some of the designs to showcase some of our historic sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Based on the last comment, I guess we ought to ask Mr. Carberry or one of the others up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| but I'm assuming this plan is a snapshot in time based on our planning efforts to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| but that it intends to grow and stretch and become whatever it needs to as we go downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you for asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| With the county park board, they have formed a committee of park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| and greenway improvements where we can revisit the document on an annual basis to set priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| One reason we presented both the city and the county park ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| and greenway ideas by sector was that we periodically update those sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| And when we go out for public involvement, we can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| here's the plan that's on the books for your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| Is there something that needs to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| So it's a reference point that enables us to know what we're looking at and how we might improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| Oh, people are getting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Please come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| I just want to tell you that this is a significant plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| and it can be used as a turning point in the provision of facilities in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| Mike and his staff, and dating back to when Ann Wallace was still with MPC before the city stole her away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4131)|
| 1:09:01| put in a lot of time on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| Before I moved to Knoxville, I lived in Dallas and worked for an engineering, architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4146)|
| 1:09:14| and planning firm that had a contract to do a parks plan for the city of Dallas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| And the contract for that plan was a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| And the elements of that plan are virtually identical to the elements of the plan that you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4163)|
| 1:09:31| It paints a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| It does a complete inventory of all the facilities that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| It does a needs assessment of what we need to do to get to where we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| That Dallas plan identified, and you'll be shocked by these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| $1.8 billion, billion with a B, dollars worth of parks improvements that were needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| to get their park system to the point where they wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| That plan was passed in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| In 2003, the Dallas Parks Foundation was created as a non-profit to raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| That foundation joined hands with the business community in 2003 and passed a bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| that identified $57 million worth of parks projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| That was almost immediately after adopting the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| After thinking about it for a few years, they put together another bond issue that went before the voters in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4230)|
| 1:10:38| The total value of that bond issue was $1.35 billion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| of which $343 million worth of parks improvements were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4245)|
| 1:10:54| So nearly 25% of the entire bond issue was dedicated to parks improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| The 2003 bond issue identified a significant park in downtown Dallas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| to address the burgeoning downtown population there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| That park was scheduled to open a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| It's now scheduled to open in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| But this is the type of thing that can bring people from across the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| from all walks of life, from the business community, the environmental community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| the parks activists together to get behind a plan and demonstrate what is happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| all over the country is that when voters are put to the test and asked to put their wallets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4301)|
| 1:11:52| where their mouths are, they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| They pass bond issues for parks and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| And so we have the opportunity to utilize this plan, I think, to really move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| and start connecting the dots on that greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| Greenways came up in every meeting that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| And people acknowledged that we were making great progress at little pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| but that we now have the opportunity to string those dots together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| and to be able to go beyond Bearden School from downtown and much farther beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| and to go from downtown to the east and downtown to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| and downtown to the north with our greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| So I would encourage you to be bold with this because it is a significant plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4353)|
| 1:12:41| Mr. De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Before you leave, Mr. Donaldson, are there any communities that find some way of having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| for lack of a better term, either a user fee or a sinking fund or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| where citizens eagerly pay, I don't know, something on the price of a ticket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| or whatever they're doing that goes into a sinking fund solely for parks or greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| or recreation that is earmarked so that it doesn't get lost in some general pot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| and spent on other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| We've had the Penny for Parks program here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| and other communities have dedicated parts of their sales tax allocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| to very specific parks projects, typically capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| so they're not lost in operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| That's probably the most common is utilization of a portion of the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4411)|
| 1:13:39| Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| What would it cost to connect all our greenways to our city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4423)|
| 1:13:51| Drum roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| A lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| I couldn't give you a number right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| I can certainly work on that, but it would be a significant amount of capital to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| How many miles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| How many miles are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| To connect all existing greenways going out to the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| Twenty, thirty miles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| At least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| At least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| And we have a lot of greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Ten Mile Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| I would just be curious as to know, you know, as the plan is shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| what it would cost if we were to take, as Mark said, that bold step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| and connect all our greenways to the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| I would ask myself the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| I know the Dallas study, we paid a little less than they did for our study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| but to put a price tag on the cost of doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| that would be something that would be worth, I think, to explore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| to get at least a ballpark figure, pardon the pun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| to figure out what the cost would be so we could then possibly know which structure we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| and what our challenges really were in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Did you want to say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| I know you'd gotten Mr. Walsh before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Mr. Watson, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| Dave Watson, East Tennessee Community Design Center, 1300 North Broadway and 500 Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4519)|
| 1:15:28| Everybody's talked about implementation and cost, and certainly that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| I appreciate you taking a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| I would encourage you to adopt this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100121_201910?start=4535)|
