| 0:01:23| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| I'm not exactly sure how we're going to start this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| I probably feel like I should start with Mr. Donaldson and if you can kind of start things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| off and I think things will get lively from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| All right, Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| First of all, I'd like to report that the Planning Commission members and staff are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| currently engaged in a retirement reception for Mike Carberry over at the new Clancy Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| I just left there and I will return upon our completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| I'd like to invite all of you over there if you're looking for alternatives to neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| meetings later this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| This is an issue that was requested by City Council back in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| MPC originally had it on its December meeting and postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| It was originally linked with a resolution asking us to make recommendations on group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| living facilities and I spent probably way too much time trying to link those two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Unfortunately, I separated them and so we had a freestanding agenda item on drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=161)|
| 0:02:48| donation centers and an additional one on group living facilities, which we still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=168)|
| 0:02:56| under considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| But since being asked to look into it, I've been much more observant as I drive around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| downtown and basically observe three types of drop-off donation facilities that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=186)|
| 0:03:16| evidence in various settings throughout the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| We have places like the Habitat for Humanity Restore, the AmVets retail operation on MLK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=201)|
| 0:03:33| the Community Chest operation on North Central, which are housed in buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| They use either all of a building or part of a building and are places where household goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=219)|
| 0:03:49| and clothing can be dropped off and donated for future resale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| We also have a couple of local non-profits such as Goodwill and Salvation Army that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=236)|
| 0:04:05| located trailers, semi-trailers, as drop-off centers, drop-off facilities in different parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=245)|
| 0:04:19| lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Goodwill, I know in my part of town, owns property that it leases to the city for a recycling center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| and operates a drop-off donation center there out of a trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| It's usually manned, at least during the normal business hours during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| And fairly recently, Salvation Army has located a very large trailer up against Kingston Pike in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=280)|
| 0:04:48| old Kmart parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| I guess it's the Knoxville Wholesale Furniture Outlet store now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| That's a second style of drop-off donation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| And then the one that's probably most prolific now are these green and now off-white and red boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=299)|
| 0:05:10| that are showing up in a variety of places, most usually in convenience stores and gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| Although you see them at our local Waffle House has a red one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| The Kroger's has a green and a white one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| And those are generally operated by organizations from outside the city and generally are fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=327)|
| 0:05:37| small in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| Probably just the proliferation of those is the key issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| So we took to the Planning Commission recommendations for definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| appropriate zone districts, and standards to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=355)|
| 0:06:03| Kind of took a look at what other cities are doing, and there aren't a lot of other cities that address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| drop-off donation centers in their zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| Nashville has recently added some provisions in their code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| and Charlotte has a fairly robust set of development standards for drop-off centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| So the Charlotte approach probably provided the best guidance for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| Our recommendation that has come through the Planning Commission is to try to differentiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| between at least two of these styles, one that is accessory to some other use that's on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| and the other being either a principal use or combined with some other principal use in a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=403)|
| 0:06:51| or a portion of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| So we've crafted the definitions in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| So we have two definitions, one for a drop-off donation center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| which would be any building or portion of a building where donations are collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| and quite often include retail on the same site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| And then there's a definition for a drop-off donation facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| which is a freestanding facility such as a trailer or a collection box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| which is accessory to the principal use on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=440)|
| 0:07:29| Do we have a working draft, Mark, somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| You should all have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| We considered this a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| There's a recycle bin over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| If it's on your agenda, you've received our backup, including all of the staff report, the exhibits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=463)|
| 0:07:51| and the minutes at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| None of us have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Brenda has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Brenda has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| No, I asked for it today, and I assumed we would each get copies tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Well, you had it from 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| So we have suggested that drop-off donation facilities be accessory to a specified number of principal uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| which include retail stores, gasoline service stations, recycling centers, or institutional uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=502)|
| 0:08:36| or they can be a principal use themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| And then we've suggested that drop-off centers be listed as a use permitted on review in the C3, C4, C6, SC1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=521)|
| 0:08:56| and C6 as uses on review, and a permitted use in SC1 and PC1, which are planned districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| which require development plan approval for all uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| And then we've created standards for each, a set of standards for the donation centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| and a different set of standards for drop-off donation facilities that are accessory uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=554)|
| 0:09:27| So that's the background on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| The standards include both centers and drop-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=572)|
| 0:09:44| Probably the biggest impact would be on the setbacks that are required for these boxes and trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| They would have to meet the setbacks for a principal building on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| Probably currently the biggest exception to that standard right now is the small boxes that are quite often set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=596)|
| 0:10:06| very close to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| They would have to meet the front yard setbacks, required minimum yards for the front, rear, and side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=608)|
| 0:10:16| which would move them away from all of the property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| They're limited to collection of household and clothing items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| They're prohibited from accepting large appliances and furniture and other bulky items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=626)|
| 0:10:34| They're required to screen any open area that is greater than 18 inches in height under a trailer or a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=634)|
| 0:10:45| We have in there a maximum size of 340 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| And they're prohibited from any outdoor storage of donated items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| Quite often you will see bags of stuff around the perimeter of these boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| And they are required to display ownership and identification information on the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| with a contact phone number in a prominent location in a sign not to exceed two square feet in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| The standards for the drop-off centers, which would be a building or a portion of a building, are to meet setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=680)|
| 0:11:32| The location of drop-off facilities, parking, and unloading areas are subject to approval by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| They have to have an employee or volunteer on duty during all hours of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| or some mechanism in place to prevent after-hour deposit of donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| And limited to the collection of clothing, housewares, small electrical appliances, and other small household items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=710)|
| 0:12:00| textiles, toys, furniture, or building materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| Prohibited, again, from large appliances or other bulky items that cannot be stored inside the drop-off donation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=725)|
| 0:12:18| Again, no outdoor storage of donated items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| And a provision that they may sell on the site any collective materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=743)|
| 0:12:32| And any facilities of the center shall be a minimum of 100 feet from any abutting residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=752)|
| 0:12:47| And there should be screening of unloading areas, trash handling, and dumpster areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| And then any facilities such as trailers or boxes have to have that same screening provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=774)|
| 0:13:07| So that is the recommendation in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| Two new definitions, providing for drop-off donation centers as uses permitted on review in the commercial zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=790)|
| 0:13:19| as permitted uses in the shopping center and planned commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| and then a set of standards for consideration as a use permitted on review for drop-off donation center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| and a set of standards for drop-off facilities as accessory uses to donation centers, retail stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=811)|
| 0:13:43| gasoline service stations, recycling centers, or institutional uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=823)|
| 0:13:51| Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| You're finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| It's been a while since I read that, but a couple of the concerns that I have is that, you know, within Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| we have a number of drop-off centers throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| It seems to me that I haven't actually looked to see where all of them are located, but we have a number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| The thing that I object to most are these boxes, and I don't understand why we even have to have the boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| why we can't just ban those totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| And then the requirements that you have for the centers, I think as far as having an enclosed building space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| and that sort of thing, I think that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| But I noticed, especially with the boxes, they're occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| You go into, whether it's a small shopping center, you know, like where there's Subway or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| and you see a couple of these boxes, and they're in front of Dollar General stores and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| And I think it might be different if we didn't have a number of places to go in order to drop things off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| The other thing are the trailers, like the one that you were talking about out at Westtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| I mean, that's just ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| I mean, it's just blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| And it seems to me that what we ought to do is we ought to just contain the services that these people provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=902)|
| 0:15:09| within buildings that we already have, such as CARM and Goodwill and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| I think the recycling centers, I understand, you know, about those containers and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| and even the new one or the one that was moved that's behind Western Plaza Shopping Center kind of makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| But that's really recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| But I just think that we ought to just completely do away with the drop-off boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| I don't even think that they're necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| I, too, have a lot of concern about the drop-off boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| For one thing, some of those businesses or whatever who are providing the boxes are taking those items out of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=942)|
| 0:15:51| to other states, and then they are being resold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| And so I'm concerned about that aspect of it, that people in our city who might need items aren't able to get them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| that this is a profitable business for somebody that we're not controlling in any way at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| The second thing has to do with that Salvation Army trailer on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| At first I thought, well, that's a, you know, there's a person, it's a staffed center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| But it's not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| There's a little door cut into the side of the trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| And if people happen to make that little opening with whatever they have good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| but if they decide on Friday afternoon to drop off furniture there, it's still there on Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| And so I really think that the couple of things, the trailer is extremely unsightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| Do these people have to get permission from the owner of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Or can you tell us a little bit about that aspect of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Because these boxes just seem to pop up everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| And, of course, that trailer is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| And my question is, do they have permission from the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| If they don't, they would be subject to, I guess, trespass violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| But I would assume there's some sort of a relationship established between the people who use the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| and the people that own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Well, I, too, I think it's smart to have a definition of the drop-off centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| I think that's smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| And I'm fully supportive of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Those are all in preexisting buildings, in retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| I think I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| The trailer, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| We don't allow other businesses to operate out of freestanding trailers in other people's parking lots now, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| So I see no benefit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| And I would say there's no way to regulate the boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Either you've got to eliminate them altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| I would eliminate them altogether, and I'd eliminate the freestanding trailers altogether, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| But definitely have the definitions and then cite them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| It's going to be a problem getting rid of all those boxes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| I don't know how that would work, but that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Tony Farrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| I'd also like to point out that I've heard what people have said, but, Councilman Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| I don't think you can allow them for local people and disallow them for the out-of-towners, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| Well, I understand that, and I'd just like to not have them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| So that would be my druthers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| Yeah, if I may, that's what I'm saying also, is we just don't need those collection boxes, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| whether they're local people, out-of-town, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| and then have the collection centers just like the folks that are local do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| And if someone from out of town wants to collect, instead of having the boxes, they can go and have a center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| And I definitely agree with George and what Mark's come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| He's come up with definitions of these things, and I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| But I just don't think we need these boxes all over town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Vice Mayor, I just wondered, does anybody have any idea how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| I know there are many across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Does anybody have a ballpark figure of just how many we're dealing with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| There are a lot of them, and my observation would be that, you know, beginning in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| when I started paying attention to them, compared to now, there are a lot more today than there were six or seven months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1162)|
| 0:19:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Question, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Is there anything about, I mean, use on review is required for some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| Is there anything about a permit or any other aspect of that contained in the MPC document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1179)|
| 0:19:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Generally, permitting is outside of the realm of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1189)|
| 0:19:57| The Planning Commission's approval as a use permitted on review is kind of a quasi-permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| in the sense that you have to have that before you go to the permitting step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| And the other thing is we really need some feedback from somebody in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| who's going to be enforcing whatever ordinance we get on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| And if we can't enforce it, we need to go back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| Councilwoman Palmer just raised the issue that's been troubling me is how do you enforce this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| We've got about eight codes enforcers out there that do the dirty lots and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| I don't know if it falls to them or the one zoning sort of code enforcement guy that's out there, Scott Elder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| But if they're spread everywhere, and I see more and more of them just like others have been reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| I don't know what has given rise to the multiplication of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| I guess they're easy to build and put out, a little plywood and a little skid and you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| It seems to me that we're making a problem that we certainly have to hear from the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| of how they would like to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| But I guess an outright ban is easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| But if you just start regulating the things around it, it's going to make a lot of work for somebody to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| It looks like they just slide off the back of a flatbed or pickup truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| I mean, it doesn't look like they're very much to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| If you don't have any information at all, you answered about the question as to whether who's doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| and how many there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Well, the one that I am most familiar with, and one of the two that I have dropped off donations at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| is the Goodwill facility, which is on property owned by Goodwill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| on which the city operates a recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| Across from Chihuly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| So therein lies one rub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| The city has already established a relationship with Goodwill to create a recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| And do we really want to turn around and say, no, you can't operate your drop-off donation facility there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| Well, that seems to be a facility that's geared all towards recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| whether it's waste products or the used goods, clothing, appliances, that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| Which would meet the definition of what you drop off at a drop-off donation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| Well, what about these, like, wooden boxes that are about, I don't know, four feet by four feet by eight feet tall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| Yeah, that's the proliferation part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| and they are somewhat different than the trailers that are operated by nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| that have longstanding relation in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| They have a contract with the city, the best I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| I mean, I think they do, to run that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| At least the recycling portion of it, and they oversee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Yeah, I would hope that Goodwill has a contract with the city to operate on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| Do you know what other cities are doing with the individual boxes that are just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| they seem to be a, they're a convenience thing, but they're just willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| They're everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| I haven't seen any prohibitions on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| The examples of Nashville and Charlotte seem to allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1398)|
| 0:23:25| they conflate what would be accessory and what would be principal into a single definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| and allow them in most all of their commercial zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| and most of their mixed-use districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| And Nashville has no other standards that are applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| They may subject them to the setbacks that, you know, for any lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| Charlotte had the most robust set of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| And I don't have the hard copy in front of me, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| I thought we would have something here on the latest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| But I remember as you were speaking that you talked about the setbacks and the screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and those kinds of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| But that would, again, come down to, I guess, city enforcement, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| of whether they are meeting the code or not with each one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Everything, every regulation in the zoning ordinance has to be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Councilman Steger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| It's my understanding when you created, when you drafted this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| you were drafting it to basically codify what was going on presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| And what I'm hearing tonight is that we want a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| that this council would like a vast deviation from what's currently happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Well, I guess my question is, I guess what we're hearing seems to be two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| One is the elimination of the small boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| Is that possible, or do you see any drawbacks to taking that step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1500)|
| 0:25:08| I can imagine that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| if a freestanding box owned by somebody else is prohibited on somebody's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| the owner of that property could in fact turn around and build a small shed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| or box of their own to do the same thing within the confines of the building envelope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| and it would be allowable by our current regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Wouldn't it have to be attached to the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| You can build a freestanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| You can have any number of structures on a commercial lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| as long as you meet the floor area ratio and stay within the building envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| Did it use on review, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Please hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Councilman Steyer, you had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Yeah, this is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| I've got a couple more questions, but I'm on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| I'm okay with people interrupting as we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| because it's sort of a complicated issue of nine people drafting an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| It's essentially what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| And so I guess that would be what you would see as the drawback to the no-boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| As to the no-trailers, would there be any drawbacks to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| I mean, I guess we're basically saying that all these trailers we see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| then they would be nonconforming at the Kroger's and recycle centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| Would that be accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Probably they could establish a legal nonconforming right on the existing ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| But if we create a prohibition on some date, then everything that's legal up to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| would be legal nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Now, they may not be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| I would say that the Salvation Army trailer that's anchored to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1624)|
| 0:27:12| adjacent to the right-of-way is not a legal structure, but that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| What would be the drawbacks of banning the trailers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| Again, there's nothing to prevent an owner of commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| from having his own trailers behind his store or behind his facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| and using them in any way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| We don't monitor how things like that are being used now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| What's different with the box is that they're owned by somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| and clearly collecting items to be taken off of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| Any retail store is continually bringing product in and selling product out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| What's the difference between having a bunch of individuals bring that product in and selling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1685)|
| 0:28:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| There's any number of ways that they could move around the prohibition, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| I agree with a lot of my colleagues that I'm for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| but I think it's maybe a little tricky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| given that a lot of these are already established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| and trying to figure out exactly what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Well, Mark, trailers do have regulations, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| You can't store in trailers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| They can't just be flat tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| We have some standards, and they have to be behind the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Aren't there standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| We certainly looked at that over here on Broadway, up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1742)|
| 0:29:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Not in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| There are all kinds of large big box retailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| that have any number of trailers on their property at any one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| They are taking in products and selling products on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| That basically is what these drop-off donation centers are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| They're getting people to deliver products to a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| and then they're turning around and selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| So if I'm the owner of a store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| and somebody approaches me about collecting donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| and they'll buy them from me, that's retail business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1798)|
| 0:30:08| Yeah, inside their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| We don't require commercial operations to be inside buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| We have lumber yards that have outside storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| We have car dealers that have outside storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1822)|
| 0:30:33| Well, you're right, Mr. Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| You're being complicated, but I think he said it's an illegal use now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1835)|
| 0:30:44| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| To segue off of what Councilman Wallace just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| even though it's not directly addressed in the drop-off centers and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| there are so many establishments that have these trailers that are sitting on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| no wheels on them, they're just big boxes that they use for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| Warehouses, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| They're warehouses, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| And while they are temporary, they've been there for years, wherever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| And I know there are several in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| I don't know if we can stretch this around those type of things or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| but that kind of falls in the same category of the trailers you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| I think they're illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| I think there are two, but we can't get them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| I think they are illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| Mr. Chairman, can we ask the city law director if he knows about the rules that we have in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| I'm sure he'd love to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| He's conferring with his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Or Krista or somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| He's crawling out on his belly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| Look at Article 5.13.7, and it speaks to some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1906)|
| 0:31:58| Charles Swanson, Lawyer, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| I'll tell you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| I really came to this workshop today to learn rather than to preach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| But I think I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| I think I hear what you're saying you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| And frankly, I'm not fully persuaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| We can't do mostly what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| With appropriate definitions and regulations of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| it seems to me that we might be able to create some regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| that would prevent these drop-off boxes and these trailers from being utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| in the way they are currently being utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| I say that without having done a massive amount of research to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| It's just based on what I've learned as a lawyer in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| and dealing with municipal regulation in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| It is conceivable to me that we can draft some regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| that will mostly accomplish what you want to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| Now, the preexisting nonconforming issue is going to be an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| and we'll have to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| But I think there are a certain number of those uses that are illegal as they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| And for those uses, they're not preexisting nonconforming uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| They are illegal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| And you can't turn an illegal use into a preexisting nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| A preexisting illegal use is an illegal use and will continue to be an illegal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| So I guess what I would say to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| I have talked to Chris DeCuccaro, who knows a lot more about land use than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| and Peter Ahrens, who is here, our codes administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| and I think we're willing to take a run at trying to put together what we hear you are saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| and see if we can come up in working together with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| maybe come up with some regulation that will work to accomplish what you want to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| Am I over-speaking myself, Krista or Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| Is there anything that I've just said that you significantly disagree with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| And feel free to say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| That's kind of where we're coming from on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| But it will take – we haven't done the work already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| And so we would need to really sit down and take a look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| and spend some time and try to put together something that we think would sort of meet your needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| and then come back to you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| And we'll have to consult with MPC as well in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| So I offer that to you for whatever it's worth, and I'd be glad to respond to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| The way I saw it, I saw Councilman Greaves-Lattin and Chairwoman Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| and then Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| I just wanted to come off of what George was saying in that, you know, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| Ace Hardware there in Bearden has two trailers in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| but they're in the back of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| They're doing a lot of storage in the front, which I have questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| You know, the trailer, to me there's a difference between a four-wheeler that's there collecting stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| as opposed to, you know, maybe the trailers that are at the drop-offs for the recycling, which some of them have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2117)|
| 0:35:25| I know the one in Bearden has one like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| But I just think that, you know, to have these not only the boxes but also to have these trailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2127)|
| 0:35:34| just sitting out in front of parking lots is just totally unacceptable, you know, for where we are as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| So I hope we can do something, whether Charles and that group can work to get that taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| I think that would be a real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Thank you, Mr. Swanson, for your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| I think we're on the right track to coming up with something that would be both legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| and something that we can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| So I really endorse the law department and MPC working together to bring us something that we can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2162)|
| 0:36:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Well, former Councilwoman Malone has come here and looks like she is armed for bear or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| So if we could, if we could give her a couple of minutes to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Well, we'll have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| I want to hear, is there anything else from this council before we move to public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| Well, we may spin off something, she says, but that's all right, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| How are you going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| Is it council members, everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I don't see any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| So we'll go to the open forum, public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Your light is still on, so you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Okay, public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| You identify yourself and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| This has been around a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| I guess it was on the agenda first in December at MPC and then February where it was unanimously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| And in my opinion, it's a disastrous thing, 340 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| That's the size of two of waste management's largest demolition trailers, largest to be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2227)|
| 0:37:15| And let me just point out, it was unanimously approved by MPC, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Anyway, I like the idea of banning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| There are cities that ban it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| We have copies of regulations where some cities regulate them, require permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| I agree that the idea of taking our sparse resources, running around measuring the size of boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2250)|
| 0:37:40| and whether or not they're taking up required parking space and causing circulation problems is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2260)|
| 0:37:49| That's not how we ought to be using our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| I think better just to ban them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| I think it's offensive that these things were considered accessory uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| Somebody explained to me how a drop-off donation center is an accessory to a gasoline service station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| by which definition is customary, incidental, necessary for the main use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| There are cities that, in fact, set distance requirements from gasoline service stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| because they think fuel shouldn't be near material that'll burn like the Dickens should a spark occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| So to have an accessory to a gas station is just unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| The Charlotte information, and I talked to the people in Charlotte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| was for freestanding, recycling-type centers, manned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2317)|
| 0:38:44| They were not for donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| That's where the 340 square feet came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| They were not for donation drop-off centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| They were for freestanding, manned centers like you would have for recycling, only this was not recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2330)|
| 0:38:59| In my opinion, the city over the years has had an arrangement with Goodwill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| so that someone from Goodwill would help with our managing the recycling centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2346)|
| 0:39:16| and would have a trailer and a drop-off box and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| I don't think those are a problem, I'm not even sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| other than regulating the recycling center when there's something with a contract with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| that needs to be handled in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| This, in my opinion, to my knowledge, came about with discussions with Old North,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| with Angelic Ministries, large storage trailers where stuff was being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| and I think continues today, being dropped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| It's unsightly, it's unbelievable, they're falling apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Those things ought to be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| When it comes to what Councilman Grieve just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2395)|
| 0:40:04| those storage boxes behind businesses, we have them up and down Broadway as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| First of all, I think we need to look at whether or not businesses are supposed to be in a building or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2409)|
| 0:40:20| and if people are just getting away cheap by having containers for their stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2420)|
| 0:40:28| and whether or not they're taking up space that was supposed to be for parking and for other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| But I think it is not in the long-term best interest of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| to have business being done out of containers or trailers rather than buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2441)|
| 0:40:50| Anyway, I do have ordinances from other cities, which Lauren Ryder from Old North did some excellent research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2450)|
| 0:41:01| and I will get to members of Council as well as to the Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| the comments from Fountain City Town Hall that were submitted over the many months of this little journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2469)|
| 0:41:18| But I really appreciate the direction you guys are taking this because I think it is the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| and I think so many of these things are illegal right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| I think the best thing to do is to ban them. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| Thank you, Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| I was with Lauren Ryder probably two years ago when we went to see Anita Cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| and probably Bob Wetzel over the Angelic Ministries issue off of Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| I guess that's Scott. I'm not sure entirely. I think that's Scott right there. It could be Oklahoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| And they have six or seven of these trailers, no tractor, just backed up to the back of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| That was a Merida Bread factory in its day, and it had a loading dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| And they had these trailers there and have been there for years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| They're used now. Churches and other groups drop off clothing and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| They drop it down a chute or take it into the basement and sort it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| And they use these trailers for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| And the neighborhood was saying they need to have some, in that case, either setbacks, screens, trees, something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2553)|
| 0:42:41| And I don't know what happened, but Coase was never able to make Angelic Ministries conform to some standard of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2561)|
| 0:42:51| Decent use as a neighbor of the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| At the time, they were also battling something that had to do with the number of parking spaces they were required to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| and they were told to acquire some additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| But the trailers were there for longstanding just storage, sorting, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| And it was somewhat of a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| It backs right up to a residential neighborhood, a historic residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| and there ought to be something we can do about these kinds of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| I see Mr. Dunthorne there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| I don't know if you know of any of the charities that are doing these small boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| but it seems like in the last six months it has gotten way out of hand from an occasional place that they had set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| They're everywhere now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| There's a barbecue place opening on Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| They haven't opened the doors yet, and they've got a contribution box out in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| It's like it comes with your permit or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| But anyway, I appreciate all the comments and hope we can work together to find a reasonable way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| I like Mr. Swanson's suggestion that if it's somehow illegal, it ain't going to get under the wire and be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| I think that's really important, and we have to look hard at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| I appreciate all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Also, I think that what I'd like to see, and Carlene pointed this out also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| is the fact of the trailers that are being used at these businesses and the containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| I know Railroad Salvage has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| They've got I don't know how many trailers sitting down there just filled with stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| And I think that at the same time that it's important that we take a look at that kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| And I do know down around the Emory Place area and up Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| there's a number of containers that are sitting on property that have been there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| The same thing in Bearden, one of the tire places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| They've had theirs there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| And, you know, again, is that part of the building or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| So I hope we can look at that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Any further comments from Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Again, the center that I am most familiar with that's in my neighborhood is a Goodwill trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2699)|
| 0:45:10| It's a converted semi-trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| It's had a door cut into it and a window cut into it within which there's an air conditioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| And a TV set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| And a TV set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| It's on their own property and on the same property as the city's recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| And so you're saying that that is an operation that you do not want to go on or to permit in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2728)|
| 0:45:38| They also have two other semi-trailers on the property that I have never seen opened or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| They may be storing stuff in there, but it is not the drop-off center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| The drop-off center is the one with the door in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| which is usually manned during certain hours, but not always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| So that's the type of thing that I was trying to accommodate with my first draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| And there's some sort of a caretaker role that man takes care of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Hold on, Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Mr. Donaldson, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| So given that description, is that the type of trailer that you want to prohibit in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2778)|
| 0:46:27| I'll put my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| I recognize Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Well, does that trailer, you say it has a door and an air conditioner unit, and it's an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| It's an office, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| And that is an illegal use inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| You've got to have bathrooms and accessible use and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| I mean, that's a place for people to, I mean, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| I mean, that would be an illegal use, and that's an illegal use now, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| I mean, you know, that would be considered an office space, and there is regulations for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| So, yes, to prevent the unintended use of it out on Kingston Pike and set it up on a permanent use, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2816)|
| 0:47:05| I think you would try to eliminate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Well, I was just going to dovetail off what Mark said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| and that was the one thing that does function as, and I don't know the legality or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| is that the site is nothing but large BFI recycling bins that you separate your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| because in the old days we separated all of our cardboard, our glass, our plastic and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| tin, and put it in the receptacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| And this structure was in the back, and it was an attendant both to help you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| if you were physically unable to hoist the stuff into the bins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| as well as there to accept for goodwill clothing and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| But, yeah, it needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| It certainly, the location was not a separate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| The location was all about recycling and reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| So there may be a different category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Mark, I think there's a difference between a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| and I think the correct political term today is a modular unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| as opposed to a tractor-trailer truck that's had a door cut in it on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| And I think that, you know, I think that there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| just like with anything that we come up with, whether it's this or whether it's signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| there's all kinds of exceptions, and we try to cover those exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| But I just think that as far as the boxes and as far as converted trailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| and as far as these container units, is it possible that, yeah, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| a business has one temporarily for a certain amount of time, but what happens again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| and I realize it has to do with enforcement also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| but I think that in order to, we have an opportunity here to really clear up the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| with a certain kind of blight and that we have this opportunity to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| and I think we should look at it from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| And I do not think that we should allow a tractor-trailer converted with a door and a window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| and an air conditioner sticking out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| If Goodwill or whoever is monitoring those kind of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| and they're collecting things, they need to have an appropriate structure at that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| So that's how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| I think that some of these most recent topics we've been discussing are part of what could be sorted out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| with the law department and MPC having some joint cooperation on some definitions and some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2954)|
| 0:49:22| and looking at what is currently in ordinance and where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| So I think that some of this can be sorted out by the legal minds and the zoning minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| that are going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| To change the subject, I would certainly like to invite my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| to the Sequoia Hills-Kingston Pike annual meeting tonight at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| You folks are certainly welcome to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| So I extend that invitation, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Is that as festive as Mike Carberry's drink-a-thon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| I would prefer to go to the retirement party, frankly, where I'm headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Can we go there first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Yeah, maybe we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Would that work, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Could we go there before we go to Sequoia Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| Do you think that would be an extension of the two-hour meeting I had with him Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| Good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140508?start=3020)|
