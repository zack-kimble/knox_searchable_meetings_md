| 0:01:53| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| We've got full house this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| First up, we're going to, I like this, discuss the conveyance of streets to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| So, Mr. Maple, we'll go ahead and turn that over to you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| You want to pull your mic down, please, and if you would identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| Yeah, the mic's not working here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| Try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| It's not plugged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Try the one at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Just plug it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| See if it's unplugged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| Try the podium one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Get them right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| You can't talk, it's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=154)|
| 0:02:42| Does that one come unplugged a lot or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Ross now, and I see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=167)|
| 0:02:56| The one at the podium usually works, if that will help you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| It's not a Verizon commercial, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Jeff Maples with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Chris Meno, our Vice Chancellor for Finance Administration, is to my right as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| Again, I appreciate the council, the opportunity to come explain further our request that we brought forth in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| and hopefully this is going to provide the information you need for us to proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| First off, I want to show you a slide which shows the existing conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| which shows that basically right now the campus owns about half the streets that run through UT Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| When you take into account on the West End, the Ag Campus, the Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| and if you look in the core of the campus, there's a mixture of city streets and university-owned streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| So, the precedent has already been set for the university to own quite a few of these streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| It's a co-mingling situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| Oftentimes, we get confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| I almost get a call every day of someone asking, is this a city street or a campus street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| So, this is kind of showing you again what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| In the next slide, you'll see what we're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Those in the green are the streets we plan to request over time to convey all those from city-owned streets to campus streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=259)|
| 0:04:28| And the purpose, again, is to bring some order to it, take away confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| and I'll show you in a minute what we think are some of the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| But like I said now, I think there's been some concern expressed by people in the city, some council members, about access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=277)|
| 0:04:46| Let me assure you very quickly, the university has no desire to restrict access to these streets that are conveyed to the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| Again, precedent has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| You see now, half the streets are campus streets now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| We do not restrict access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| I do not know anyone that has been denied the ability to drive on any of these campus streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| That is not what we plan to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| So, again, that's like I said, to me this map shows what we're trying to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| and that should not be a concern at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Mr. Martin, a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Let's clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| There are two roads that could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| So, we need to be real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| And I plan on presenting that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I appreciate you bringing that up, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| You know, this is what we're proposing at this time to move forward as far as those streets in green we're asking for over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=333)|
| 0:05:42| We want to do it in, well, it will be more than one, two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| The initial phase are the streets listed above that we want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| It's currently on the ordinances that for next council meeting to convey to the university at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| As you see, there are eight streets listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| The reason we're doing it in phases, let me show you the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| is that these other streets here have private ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| So, we have right-of-way issues we must deal with first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| And that will take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| But we didn't want to slow the process down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| So, these right here have no private ownership attached to those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| So, it's a much easier process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| But as we work with the private landowners, these remaining streets, we will come back to council at a later date to ask for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| conveyance of those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Again, as I note at the bottom, the transfer of these streets does not in any way restrict access to the roadways of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| That is not our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| Let me go on to tell you some of the benefits we think this occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| The city no longer has to maintain the streets, the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| I know that sometimes can be a financial burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| We're willing to take on that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| We've done the cost analysis and we feel it's in the benefit of the university to proceed with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| UTPD will now be the first responders rather than KPD for traffic accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| It takes less burden off KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| It's going to assist the campus in planning for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| We have our master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| I'm going to show you some slides later on that really kind of portrays what we want to try to do, which is part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| impetus here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| It allows us to react in a more timely manner concerning sidewalk complaints, address requests for pedestrian crossings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| and maintain silence for crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| This is a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| We get a lot of concerns or complaints from students regarding a pothole, something happened to the car they hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| And we can't touch those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Those are owned by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| And we realize the city has a lot more responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| You've got the entire citywide that's your priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| You can't concentrate for the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| We realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| But we're willing to take on, again, that responsibility to address those matters quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| I mean, you've got east, west, north, all the different parts of the city that you have to be concerned with as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| We recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| But this will allow us to be able to react quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| We get all the time requests from students for pedestrian crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| And we have to deal with the city on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| And, again, they are great partners, but it takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| And sometimes students don't understand the process of why it takes so long to install those crossings at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=501)|
| 0:08:30| It allows us to expedite capital projects quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| That's, again, something that when you look at that, when we have to deal with multiple agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| it's, you know, the bureaucratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| It just adds time to those projects as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| We can monitor what we want to do on the campus is monitor the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| and visualize them during special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Oftentimes, we get lots of requests to set up barricades or barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| And we have to get with the city to block off meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| But we oftentimes want to stage buses on areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| And that just, again, to try to accommodate those guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| And, again, we have to go through those approval processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| So we really feel like this will help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| And then the overall safety with temporary lane closures or lane shifts when we have projects going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| It will just help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Those are all benefits, we think, that will benefit both the university and the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| Now, let me quickly show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| I have slides in front of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| You can't see it very well up here, but these are some of the improvements we've done lately by working with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| Along Antehope Avenue, you see the brick pavers and the trees, the landscaping we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| This is what we want to do throughout the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| You know, oftentimes, you read where the – which we feel is not justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| But by some reviews that we have a very ugly campus, we don't believe that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| However, we want to address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| We want to do a lot of streetscape projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| So this is what we've got in mind a little bit there on Antehope Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| Now, what Vice Mayor Pavlis mentioned a minute ago, let me be up front with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| There are two streets which we do plan to have partial closures on within the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| That is a partial closure of Johnny Majors Boulevard, which is the road that runs between the football complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| and the current Stokely Athletic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| We plan on doing a project there to expand the football fields, a new parking garage, and a new residence hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| Because of that, we will partially close the west end of Johnny Majors Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| But the east end of the boulevard will still be open to access the parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| The other piece is what's listed on the, you see up above you, is the extension of the pedestrian mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| As you know now, we have a highly used pedestrian mall that runs from Volunteer Boulevard down to Melrose Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| Students love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| It's something we did years ago in conjunction working with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| And we want to extend that pedestrian mall further west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| So the plan would be to close Andy Holt Avenue from where it currently ends, the pedestrian mall at Melrose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| and extend it down to Francis Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| And we'd like to do that within the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| And what you'll see up there is kind of a diagram of what we envision that to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| Again, so the pedestrian mall then will actually stretch from Volunteer Boulevard down to Francis Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| The ultimate goal of this is to make a spine for our students from the west end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| where the residence halls are located, all the way to the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| And we're building a pedestrian crossing across the former way this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| So the intent is to allow our students to exit the residence hall, be on a pedestrian mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| and walk all the way to the hill to classes and not have to eventually have to encounter vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| It's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| We think it's a beautification desire as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| But that's what you see listed above, up on the screen, the extension of the pedestrian mall west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| that portion of Andy Holt Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| We're also extending, as I mentioned a minute ago, the old Andy Holt Avenue between Volunteer and Phillip Fulmer Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| We're going to extend the pedestrian mall there, a campus beautification project that will stretch from Volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| down to Phillip Fulmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| That's what you see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| That will happen here in the next year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| These are all the types of projects we want to do as we proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| Phillip Fulmer Way, we're currently on that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| and we've got plans for a beautification project along through there in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| That street will remain open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| We'll just do a streetscape project with trees and brick pavers and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| And that kind of gives you a quick slide there as well, showing you what we plan on doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| You see the grass median in between the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| Lots of work we're going to do, we believe, that will enhance that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| And then, as you see, what we've done with Lake Loudoun, most of you have been on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| That's taken on a dramatic change in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Again, that's just kind of a foresight of what we want to do with other streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| As you know, you'll see here are some photos of what we've done with the brick retaining walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| the brick pavers, the landscaping, all through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| And you'll see here part of that with the Pat Summitt statue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| That's been part of that project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| And then long-term, we've got Volunteer Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| You look at it, it's, to be perfectly honest with you, it doesn't look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| It's a main thoroughfare through the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| We want to do, again, keep the street open for access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| but we want to do things for streetscape projects along there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| That's kind of a quick slide of what shows that we plan to do over the next few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| if we get approval to proceed with this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| There's kind of a plan of how it would look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Existing conditions, mid-range plans, and long-range plans along Volunteer Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| I know I'm going quickly, but I know our time is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| But that's a quick scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Hopefully that provides some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| I'm very open to questions at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Councilman Campin, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Councilman Delmo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you, Mr. Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| I think when you were here before us before, we had heard that some of the streets were going to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| We didn't have any of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| It was a concern about are we going to inhibit, you know, the good flow of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| It sounds like this is part of an enlightened plan to improve the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| I am personally familiar with the pedestrian mall area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| And it's a great place for students to walk safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| And there's always tons of traffic and tons of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| And they don't always mix well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| So I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Vehicles and students don't match well sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Well, I'm especially impressed by people that have their cell phones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| and they're texting while they're crossing across four lanes of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| And there's a little plastic doobie that sits up in the middle of the street that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| don't run over the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| And they trust that while they're texting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| It makes me crazy just watching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| But I can understand you've got to move a lot of people in a very short period of time between classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| And so that makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| One thing you did say that you were going to close, I think it was Johnny Major's Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Was it part of the time why you did some improvement of the field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| No, it would be a no, not the entire street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| But, yes, it would be a permanent closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| The west end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| If you know where the go down Johnny Major's Boulevard now, you know where the football fields are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| You know, from that, those fields will go across major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| So really that portion, about half the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| Are you going to make it a continuous pedestrian way, too, in that sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Just open to the usage rather than vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Part of it will be a football practice field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| But the east end of Johnny Major's will still be open to bring access into a new parking garage that will also be on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=970)|
| 0:16:18| And I assume you're going to make provisions to have good roundabout road signage so people can find their way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| You know, you've got vendors that set up there on those special Saturdays and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| So I know you all have, I would assume you have some type of a process for vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| whether it be food vendors or whatever, you know, souvenirs, whatever they're selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| So how will that be affected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Well, several years ago, we actually moved all the vendors off Phillip Farm away for security reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| After 9-11, again, to allow us to not do anything to inhibit us searching or detract from the ability to enhance our security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1015)|
| 0:17:06| So they were moved to Volunteer Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Since that's a city street, those vendors have to get a city permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| What we would do, if it conveys over to the university, they would have to come to the university and get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| And what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I mean, just in a nutshell, how is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| We would set up a procedure to go through our solicitation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| We have our solicitation process in place now, and they would have to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| We would probably look at providing a seasonal permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| We haven't addressed that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| But, yeah, we recognize that need to keep some of that open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| What's the permit cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| Right now, there's no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| Oh, they just get approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| No, they have to get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| But you know who's there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| We want to know they're there and where they're going to be at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| We would tell them where exactly to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| I was under the impression that there was a process to where they did get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| It cost however much money to have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Currently, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| They just have to get approval through several different channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| And that will still be open to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| I mean, they're small street vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| You know, and it's tough to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| And they count on that for their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| We recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| So that you feel like that that will pretty much remain intact as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Yeah, I'm not going to say forever, you know, perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| But for the short term, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| I would say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Jeff, thanks for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| This is extremely helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| It's going to help with our constituents also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Two questions I have is what kind of coordination have you done with KUB in terms of all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| And then also I notice our fire chief is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Has there been coordination with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| With KUB, they recognize that they have still the ability, right of access into those utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| and those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Again, the same thing, as I said now, you saw the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| There's utilities on the existing campus streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| And they've had no issues of accessing those utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| In regards to KFD, we work great together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| And we would notify them in the event we were to close a street for a week or two that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| change their ability to access in the event of an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| We would work out protocols to notify those agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| And anytime we always, when we do construction on campus, setting up, one of the things we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| always talk to the designers about is how emergency vehicles access those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| So that would be in our planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Safety is prominent with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| So, yeah, we would set up a protocol and notify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| We do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Jeff, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| This has been a great presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| And the one you sent to us, of course, is exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| But I appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| I did get a question from some folks back in the fraternity area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| And I don't know that this was not from one of the bad boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| This was from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Unnamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| But one of the good ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Anyhow, the question had to do with security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| And I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Near and dear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| But it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| And you touched on this briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| The campus security versus the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| In this particular instance, they, this fraternity, would prefer to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| And I don't know what they're able to do or not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| The Knoxville Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| And I guess they would hire off-duty police officers to watch their events, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| So I don't know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| And I don't even know that this is a valid question regarding this road closure thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| Or that the road closure or not would affect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| No, the road closure wouldn't affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| It's our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| We.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Road change event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Now, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| On university property, it is our desire for our UTPD to provide all security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| And also to know who's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| It would not be in our best interest for it to have split jurisdictions on a campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| We don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| We have another agency patrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| They may have different protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Different standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| So we prefer to have anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| As far as security on this campus, it flows through UTPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| Probably what you've heard before, they would prefer someone else provide that security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| But it's, again, if an incident occurs, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| And it would really cloud the issue to have to have multiple agencies dealing with an incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| That actually makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| The question, or at least my interpretation, was that they had some authority to hire their own personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| or their own security officers for various events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| And, you know, a lot of our officers perform that kind of duty in their off-duty moments for various things around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| Well, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| And we do employ KBD and KCSO officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| But we put them on our payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| And they report to us and follow our protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| So we utilize that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1346)|
| 0:22:34| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you for coming tonight because I really had a lot of questions in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| And you've answered them very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| And so I'm kind of jumping on some of my colleagues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| I think the PowerPoint, getting it in advance, was a good thing to be able to really look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| And we've looked at some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| So thank you again for taking the time to answer our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| I don't see any more lights, any further questions, comments, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| And we'll look forward to seeing you, I believe, Tuesday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1389)|
| 0:23:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Why don't we take a five-minute recess and then we'll reconvene here for the sign, proposed sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1400)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1416)|
| 0:23:45| At this point in time, we'll start with the discussion of the proposed sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| And I will turn it over to Councilman Grieve and Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor and colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| This has been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| We appreciate the opportunity to begin to inform you on what we have been doing for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| I want to give a little summary in terms of where we were and how we got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| Then I would like to also give the opportunity for the signed task force members, if they wish, to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| And then hopefully what will happen is that we'll have some public forum time at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Hopefully we'll have at least 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| One thing that I would like to share with council is that in going through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| and putting it all together, and especially in the last couple of months, that you may wish to have more than one workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| I know that we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| We're not crazy about workshops, but with what we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| and what we've gone through and what we've learned just even in the last couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| it may be necessary to have another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| I am thinking that we possibly definitely need another public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| As with a lot of things, now that the draft has been put on the Web site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| and people have really had a chance to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| we're getting a number of questions about items that different people are interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| But let me just take a few moments and talk about the history in terms of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| Some of you were here on November 15, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| when an ordinance was presented to amend the sign regulations, Article 5, Section 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| And that was basically to deal with the maximum heights of ground in monument signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| The sign test was put together, was formed, and this was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| And our first task force meeting was February 22, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| At this time, I do want to introduce the sign task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| and tell you a little bit about the makeup of the individuals involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Let me go back, though, and say that even though that originally what we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| is heights of ground in monument signs, once we got into the existing ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| we found that the height of signs and the size of signs were spread all over the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| One of the things we quickly found was how disorganized the whole ordinance was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| and so we really took it upon ourselves to not only look at the height of signs and the size of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| but to begin to really get into the whole ordinance in terms of trying to come up with a much better organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| and bring it up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| With that, of course, it caused a lot of concern over a number of issues on the signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| which we did get involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| But let me introduce the sign task force members and tell you a little bit about the makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Of course, I'm the chair as an architect and also as former president of Senior Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| I've been very much involved in neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| so in essence represented the neighborhood or represented, I guess you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| neighborhood groups as far as being chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| We had asked the chamber if they would look at the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| and help us select different individuals also for the signed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| George Wallace, also one of our fellow colleagues, realtor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| and has been involved in a number of also neighborhood organizations as well as the Realtors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| Joyce Fells is the existing president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| She also has been involved in a number of professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| and social organizations in the city and brings that expertise to the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| Gary Hayes is employed with the Neon Service Company actually since 1987,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| and has had over 40 years of experience in the sign industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| So we have that type of representation on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| David Jarnigan was vice president of Lamar Advertising, and he was an early member of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| He moved, and we did get back with the chamber to find out whether or not they wanted to replace him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| and they chose not to at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| Melissa McAdams is a retired lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| She's been active in environmental education and historical preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| is very much involved in the Garden Club of America, and brings that expertise to the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| Jim Nixon, a realtor also with Turley & Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| has really been responsible for all aspects in the development of the Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| And as you all are aware, Turkey Creek is a shining example of what signage can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| and what they've done through the development of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Don Parnell is planning, has extensive background in planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| a graduate of Vanderbilt University with a master's of science in planning from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| He's a charter member of the American Institute of Certified Planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| has also been very much involved in neighborhood organizations and this sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| And then Bill Weigel, and I want to take a few moments just to say that Bill would be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| but he is presently in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| He's been hospitalized for the last two and a half months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| and he's definitely been in our thoughts and prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I had a conversation with him as he was flying home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| He must have called me three or four times from both Atlanta, and he's been in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| He's very much concerned about the signed task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| and the results in terms of what we're coming up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| And so he told me today that he's going to be here in spirit, even though he has Chris Wooten is here in his stead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| But Bill is at the hospital tonight and hopefully will be going home tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| but still has quite a bit of recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| So I ask that all of us keep him in our thoughts and prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| But as you know, Bill Weigel is the CEO of the Weigel Stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| and also was a very active member of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| And then the task force couldn't have really done what it did or where it's been or where it is today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| without the help of an extremely loyal, extremely dedicated staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| I want to give a lot of credit to Mark Donaldson, who's the executive director of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| attended all our meetings, was really the leading force in terms of helping us get through the old signed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| as well as getting through with the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Ann Wallace, who is Knoxville, she's also with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| She's the planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1821)|
| 0:30:21| We know her as the coordinator of the Cumberland Avenue Corridor Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| And Ann was an invaluable also staff person who has done quite a bit of work with the overlay on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1825)|
| 0:30:34| And if you go down there and see the crystal sign and the McDonald sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| and the new hotel sign, that's kind of where we're headed, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Some of us do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| And then Anita Cash, you will remember, she has retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| but she was the zoning coordinator for the city of Knoxville and especially with signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| and was invaluable with her experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Years and years of experience working with the signs and helping us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| And then Angela Ruber has also left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| She was with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| And her expertise and background with the legal aspect with the signed ordinance helped us tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| And then another person that I couldn't have gotten along without was Cindy Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| And I don't know where Cindy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| She's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Cindy has been at all our meetings, and she's taken care of all our paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| And so a lot of credit to Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| So those are the members of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| As I mentioned, we started our first meeting in February 22nd, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| We've had over 30 meetings in the last two years, each of those meetings lasting at least two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| If you consider eight members at 60 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| that's over 480 hours of input that have been put in by the individuals on this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| I also want to say that very few people missed any of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| This has been a very dedicated group of folks that have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| We've had two public hearings where we've heard from over 40 speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| We've had over 200 e-mails that we've received in terms of public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| The other thing that we did is we went back and reviewed sign applications over the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| We actually reviewed 5,727 sign applications to see what has been done in the city of Knoxville in terms of not only the heights of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| signs but the size of signs and the kinds of signs that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| And we'll talk about that a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| As I mentioned, we've always had full participation of the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| We have reviewed a number of sign ordinances from cities not only in Tennessee but across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| The task force was monitored the entire time by the Women's League of Voters, who they graded us, you might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1961)|
| 0:32:50| And also the ordinance has been posted on the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| It's our understanding that a proposed ordinance will go to MPC next week for their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| And again, with some of the changes that have come up just in the last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| it may be that the sign ordinance that we have may have to be re-looked at in some parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| But we're hoping to bring this before city council in the early part of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| So we continue to get input not only from MPC but city council but also written submissions that have been coming in to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2000)|
| 0:33:30| As I mentioned earlier, there may be the possibility of another public hearing, if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| and then also as far as any kind of workshop that may need to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| What I'd like to do now is to give the sign task force members an opportunity, if they wish, to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| We'll ask them to come up, and I guess, Mayor, give them four or five minutes if that's okay, depending on who would like to on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| So who would like on the task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Who would like to make any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Not you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| Where's my volunteer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| Hey, Dwayne, you told us what you started out as your main objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| What did you end up as the four or five points you really tried to hit hard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| I mean, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Let us go through that, and we'll get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| You're going to get to that next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Members of council, my name is Don Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I reside at 1214 Craig Road in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you for holding this workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| and turning your attention to the issue of signed regulations in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| Thanks again from the task force to Cindy and Mark and Ann and the others who have been extremely helpful to the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2079)|
| 0:34:49| during this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| It's been my privilege to serve with the members, each of the members of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| and made the effort during the past two years to reach a point when we could present to you what we believe is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| reasonable set of recommendations related to various issues concerning signs within the corporate limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| This has not been an easy assignment for any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| The issues are many, and they are not easily resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| There are many signs already in place, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| and they enjoy, as they should, a grandfathered status as it relates to any potential changes in the signed regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| We've reviewed the recent, as you heard Councilman Grief say, ten-year history of actual signed permit requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| We've reviewed signs throughout the community as we have gone out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| We've heard citizens speak at public meetings as to their own views of how regulations should be structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| At the end of the day, what we are presenting is not perfection, nor should it be expected to reach that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2147)|
| 0:35:55| The balancing that has occurred relates to the legitimate needs of businesses to advertise their businesses so that the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| is made aware through reasonable signed displays of their presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| and to weigh those rights and expectations against those of people who have particularly concerns about the aesthetics of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| The latter perspective is an important one, as we all appreciate the broader environment of East Tennessee and this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2177)|
| 0:36:27| Many of the issues are quantitative in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Sign height, the sign face size, the sign location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| And those require some regulatory treatment that involves quantitative parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| There are also qualitative considerations that are often more difficult to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| Quantitative responses to qualitative issues are and will be imperfect at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2210)|
| 0:36:59| Please accept that we have made a good faith effort to balance, resolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| and reasonably approach the issues that were before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| I hope that you will appreciate the work that the task force has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Weigh it in the balancing that you now must do, knowing perhaps that none will be pleased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| but all can appreciate that an honest effort has been made to go forward with reasonable regulations for the city at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| I did want to mention that in going through this process, as Don pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| it's been difficult and that one of the things that we've tried to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| each of us have looked at the main ideas in terms of what we had to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| which had to do with sign heights and sign sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| And I would say that probably none of us are extremely pleased with what we finally came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| just from the standpoint of where we were coming from and what we would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| One of the things that I learned from the League of Women Voters, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| that I thought was interesting is they talked about consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| And they said there are three aspects of consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| One, that everyone supports it, which we didn't have that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| One, that everyone can live with, which they say is the more common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| And the other one is a widespread agreement where you generally take a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| and the majority of the folks, generally a super majority of the vote, comes up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| We may not all expect to be pleased with the outcome of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| But I think in this particular case that one of the things that I'd like for you to know is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| that we didn't necessarily vote on every issue that you see in the document that we sent to you the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| especially the side-by-side document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| There were issues that we did vote on, but some we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| We just came to kind of consensus in the meeting on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| I also want to say, and I sent an e-mail out to you folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| the one that we're actually going to review that Mark is going to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| with us is the side-by-side that you did get a week or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| The one that I had sent out today or yesterday, one of the reasons I sent that out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| because it has the photographs of the different signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| And there were only two minor changes in that, which when we come to that, we'll talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| So the one that you really looked at is the one that we are going to review on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| And we want to bring that up again also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| So I think, Joyce, I think you'd like to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| Thank you, Councilman Grieve, and good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| I appreciate very much the opportunity to have served on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| I appreciated the dedication of my fellow task force members, Councilman Grieve as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| Councilman Wallace as co-chair, and the city staff who, I'd say Mark Donaldson put in a human amount of effort into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2385)|
| 0:39:54| And I appreciated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| I think the task force is recommending many positive changes to the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| and they will result in a lot of benefit for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| As other people have said, probably no one on the task force is 100% satisfied with all the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| But then that's what happens when you have differing opinions and a compromise has to be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| In many ways, Knoxville has been a leader in setting progressive sign policy that protects the appearance of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| It passed a ban on new billboards in 2001, kept digital billboards illegal in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| and enacted a ban on new EMCs in 2010 along with restrictions on their operating characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| But unfortunately, it's been saddled with an outdated sign ordinance that has wreaked visual havoc on our interstates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| and urban streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Two years ago, city council recognized this, passed new maximum allowable sign heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| Did you get the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Did you get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| So this is just to help you follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| What I'm referring to here is Table 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| Passed new maximum allowable sign heights on first reading and asked that the topic receive further study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| At this point, it was decided that the total ordinance needed revision and the task force was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| And Councilman Grieve bravely stepped up to chair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| We'll have to ask him at the end of the process if he regrets that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| Although total revision of a sign ordinance includes many goals by necessity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| the primary mission of the task force derived from council's intent two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| and that was to decrease sign clutter and improve the appearance of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| I don't think I ever said my name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| I'm Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, and I'm sure you all know I'm president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| I'm speaking here tonight partly as a task force member and partly as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| Scenic Knoxville doesn't believe that the task force recommendations on sign size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| and height will make a sufficient impact on the visual blight of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| and significantly improve its appearance for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| I'm not aware of any research that shows big and tall signs are good for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| In fact, we maintain exactly the opposite, and there are data to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| However, if, and I emphasize the if here, if big tall signs do increase business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2551)|
| 0:42:39| I suspect it's for a small minority of businesses and businesses that are only of a certain nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| Perhaps understandably in this discussion, these are the loudest voices in support of big signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| Nonetheless, council has to consider the whole community when making this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| We believe that a good sign ordinance that reduces visual pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| and protects our public spaces is what's best for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| We also believe that this is what the majority of people in the community want and are expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| You've seen the major opposition that has been mounted against individual signs of new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| People are serious about this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| I support the creation of special sign districts, but this is not a substitution for a good ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| and I think that Mr. Donaldson is going to talk more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| And maybe I shouldn't talk about that since it hasn't been talked about yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| One other issue that I would like to mention, and this came up after the conclusion of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| but I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| As I said, in 2001, city council banned new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| We think the intent of this ban was twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| First, the intent was not to not allow the number of existing billboards to increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| and second, the intent was to achieve a reduction in the number of billboards over time due to factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| such as construction, natural disasters, and changing land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| Unfortunately, since 2004, the city has allowed at least 27 billboards to be moved or rebuilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2651)|
| 0:44:20| TDOT has strict regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| and I think you probably all understand that all of our billboards are what are considered to be legal nonconforming billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| They're nonconforming because we have a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| They're legal, however, because they were grandfathered in after the ban was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| But that puts them in a special category from conforming billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| So all city billboards are legal nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| TDOT has strict regulations regarding the legal nonconforming billboards under its jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| and does not allow them to be altered or moved in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| And we would like to see these regulations codified into the city sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| And, again, I think Mr. Donaldson is going to talk more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| Thank you, Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Well, I think what I would like to tell council is that it's been a ñ that Duane's done a really good job of an exhaustive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2712)|
| 0:45:23| really, work on not just sign heights, not just sign area, but definitions, examples, what other cities studied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2723)|
| 0:45:33| what other cities' sign ordinance looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| We've really done the work along with Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| We've done the work to create a sign ordinance new for Knoxville that's going to last for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2739)|
| 0:45:47| And this is our opportunity as city council to study it, review it, take input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| and to make decisions that is a long-term, have a long-term lasting effect for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| This is our chance to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| And we spent a lot of time, even though we took a little bit of the ribbing from our fellow council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2760)|
| 0:46:08| and I appreciate that as you can look up, Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| I mean, we enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| But we spent hours, for instance, talking about what is a dilapidated sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| What is an abandoned sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| How do you define it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| And how can we make sure that if we write a sign ordinance that we can enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| And you have pieces of your sign ordinance now that's basically unenforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| or pieces of it that we don't, that we choose not to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| And I think it was if we're going to have an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| we want to make sure that we have the legal right to enforce it and go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| So it's a lot more than sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| And we want to make sure that it's clear and it's clear to the average person that they can read it and understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| And so it took an overhaul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| I think what we found out is, very quickly, is that sign ordinance is wrapped around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| and weaved into your zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| And I think Mark has put together and we put together a sign ordinance that starts looking at sign height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| and sign area by the street and the street it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| We spent a tremendous amount of time talking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| and why you have sign heights at particular places, faster the car and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| We went through a lot and we spent a lot of time talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| Endless, it seemed like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| But I think we all learned quite a bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| So it's a lot more easy to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| And I think we can continue to understand it and do some work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| So, Dwayne did a good job on behalf of sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| You have it there in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Thanks for the vote of confidence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| It couldn't have been done without the whole committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Before I turn it over to Mark to walk us through, and, again, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| we're going to be using the one that goes side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| Melissa is going to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| So go ahead, Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| I want to second the plot to city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| They did yeoman's work and we should all be proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| And I really thank them, especially Cindy, for getting us a mountain of material that probably would stack about this high on my desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| And thank you, city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| And I want to thank scenic Knoxville for allowing me the opportunity to participate in this sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| Sign clutter and blight is an obvious problem in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| I urge you to pass an improved ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| We toured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| We studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| We listened to public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| And we examined the sign permits from the past dozen years or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| What I learned is that our city's current sign regulation can be described as meaningless in many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| particularly as regards maximum sign heights and sign areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| Most permits issued come nowhere close to needing or requesting the maximum height footage or area square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2935)|
| 0:49:06| As to sign regulation in office districts, it's apparently too restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| and most variances are related to this part of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| The code is difficult to understand because it has been written by accretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| and it is time to make it more understandable to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| And enforcement has been based on complaint rather than reasonable inspection schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| Those four reasons are part of why we made these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| There were lots more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| The sign blight in Knoxville is particularly noticeable where a multitude of pole signs vie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| with existing billboards along our major thoroughfares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| The distraction and just plain ugliness of some areas along Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| and other major roads does not present Knoxville in a light we can or should be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=2993)|
| 0:50:01| Two areas of concern I still have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| On sign height, the task force split on maximum heights, particularly on or near the interstate intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3005)|
| 0:50:15| These intersections are the most visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| and the first impression introduction to all visitors to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| All visitors, unless they helicopter in or take a balloon or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| That is what they see of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| The pole signs as they helicopter in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| But those intersections present such a first impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| And I just really think we need to keep that in mind and that 50 foot is not necessary on top of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| And most of our intersections are located on high points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| That makes those signs visible for miles, not just a mile down the road, miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3051)|
| 0:50:59| And I heard in our meetings several times that we need to keep in mind Knoxville's topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| But that point does cut both ways and it impacts properties in the valleys as well as property on top of hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3064)|
| 0:51:12| And the other thing I still have a concern about is understanding state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| I think we really owe it to ourselves to be familiar with what state law does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| and doesn't allow the city of Knoxville to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| An example was sign heights on scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| And I think our code currently says 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| And we were told that's because state law requires 35 feet to be the maximum height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| Well, after looking into it, it does not require 35 feet maximum height be allowed on scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| That language has something to do with the maximum height of buildings that could be within so many feet of a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3105)|
| 0:51:56| Another example is logo signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| At one of our public meetings, a business said we're not allowed to have logo signs at the intersections in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| And if we could just advertise our hotel on a logo sign, we wouldn't need a big pole sign at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3125)|
| 0:52:14| And I think if that's true, the city should be talking to state legislators for our businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| on behalf of our businesses, to try and understand why that's not allowed on our intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| where businesses can put the small logo signs and people will know they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| And the other thing about state law is, I think we all know, state property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| And I guess when you're considering turning over our streets to the state, what kind of signage they can put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| they don't have to obey our regulations whatsoever, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| Thank you for your time and thank you for the opportunity, and good luck with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| Thanks, Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Is anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| Before she leaves, if I could, Mr. Chairman, did you all look at the state grandfather law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| and see if there was any way to deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| Because it was a billboard-lobbied law to begin with, and it obviously tries to preserve forever once you build a sign like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3190)|
| 0:53:19| It can be rebuilt, maintained, expanded, and all those crazy things that make more sense for a building than they do for a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| But did you all look into that and whether there was any relief from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| Nick, we really, as far as when it came to billboards, we didn't look at billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| One of the things that Melissa was talking about are our logo signs, you know, along the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| the small signs that say that, that was looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| But we didn't go into any great detail about billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| On the logo signs, we've been fighting that issue on exit 8 of I-640, and I think I appeared before you one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| And the crazy rule, I am told by the state reps, is that it's forced upon the state by the FHA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3234)|
| 0:54:03| the Federal Highway Authority rule that says in cities over 100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| you can only have them on the first exit in and out of the city, but you can't have them in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| And whether it's anti-clutter or pro-billboard, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| But it needs some attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| It needs to be looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Before Mark starts in on the side-by-side ordinance that you had before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| I just want to stress again that all of us did an awful lot of work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| And I just want to point out that one of the things that was interesting to me is that even though our existing ordinance has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3272)|
| 0:54:40| sign heights the height they are, I think there's a bit of self-regulations that have gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| And this was proven to me anyway when in reviewing, I mentioned to you that we looked at over 5,700 sign permits over the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3286)|
| 0:54:55| And of those sign permits, that included all sign permits in the city for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| But of that, there were 723 either monument or pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| And what was interesting to me in looking at that was that of those signs over 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| only 8 percent of those signs were taller than 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| Twenty-three percent of those signs were between 25 and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| But 77 percent of all those signs were 25 feet or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| And so there has been sort of a self-regulation in terms of sign heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| But I thought that was interesting to bring up and to let you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| With that, let's go ahead and take a look at the side-by-side ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| And I'm going to have Mark go through this and review with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3342)|
| 0:55:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| I am going to speak off this one-page, both-side copy titled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| Summary of Proposed Sign Regulations with the December 5 date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| Does everyone have a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Page one has format up at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| And this is laid out with respect to the new outline for the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3370)|
| 0:56:21| The format is significantly different than the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| The current code has one large section called General Regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| and then goes immediately into Regulations by Zone District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| So we have modeled this after reviewing many, many ordinances from a variety of cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3394)|
| 0:56:43| as well as several model ordinances developed by both the sign industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| and the American Planning Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| And it will – this format will make it very – a lot easier to find specific regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| and standards for each type of sign in the specific zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| We're proposing to move the definitions related to signs into this section rather than in the general definitions area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3426)|
| 0:57:14| of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| And then we've actually removed a couple of sections that are in the current sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| dealing with permitting and fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| There are better places for those particular ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| The task force spent a lot of time drafting the new purpose section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| because it really lays the foundation for what comes after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| And if you look at the side-by-side comparison, page one, the previous purpose was stated in one sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3463)|
| 0:57:54| And we have expanded that to two subsections with a number of bullet points associated with each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3474)|
| 0:58:03| That rolls right into the applicability and scope section, which is new and expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3483)|
| 0:58:11| So we've gone from two paragraphs to about eight paragraphs on how this ordinance applies to various situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| and how the ordinance is to be interpreted and provides a lot more clarity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| And as I mentioned before, we're moving – proposed to move definitions into this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| so that people involved in the sign business will have everything right in front of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| in Article 5, Section 10 of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| without having to find their way throughout the rest of the zoning ordinance in order to deal with signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3520)|
| 0:58:52| The next section is – well, with regard to the definitions, we've added quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3532)|
| 0:59:05| Some of the key ones, we've gone from a nomenclature that talks about advertising signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| and switched that to use the term off-premise signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| and from the current use of the term business signs to the use of the term on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3556)|
| 0:59:25| This corresponds with the vast majority of sign codes that are out there in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| and it helps alleviate some of the confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| and the multiple uses of the words advertising and business in a sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3575)|
| 0:59:45| I noticed over the past decade or so the use of on-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3585)|
| 0:59:53| and off-premise creeping into the code as it was amended in a piecemeal fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| So this completes that effort and we've replaced the old terms with the new terms throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3598)|
| 1:00:06| We've added definitions for a variety of different sign types, including abandoned sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| That was a topic of much discussion during the middle part of our sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3611)|
| 1:00:21| The next section deals with prohibited signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| This consolidates language that is found from throughout the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| In developing the side-by-side exhibit that you've got, I literally cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| and then pasted into the outline every paragraph from the current sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| into a new position in the proposed ordinance to allow for comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3643)|
| 1:00:55| The list of prohibited signs actually doesn't change a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| We've added a few at the end of our meeting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3660)|
| 1:01:10| The task force actually voted on most of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| Signs placed on parked vehicles for the primary purpose of being a sign is proposed to be prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| Portable signs, roof signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| and then window signs that exceed 25% of the window area in which the sign is displayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| And that works not only with regard to sign clutter, but also with regard to street life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| and the desire to maintain transparency through windows and doors from the street into businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| so that you can see the activity and it adds to street life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| And having windows completely filled up with unpermitted signs, really it adds to the clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3711)|
| 1:02:00| and decreases from the transparency in the street life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| The next section, signs exempt from these regulations, is virtually all new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| We've listed about 30 signs that through policy had been kind of chosen to be exempt from the regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3732)|
| 1:02:27| so we're making that statement in the code that these are signs that are exempt from all of these regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3747)|
| 1:02:38| One of them that currently is exempt from the permit requirement is the temporary signs for political purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| We had quite a bit of discussion on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| There are freedom of speech issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| So that now finds its way to the section that exempts them from regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| On several of these, we've added some standards that the signs have to achieve in order to remain exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| so they can become permitted and subject to the total allowable sign area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3789)|
| 1:03:16| if they exceed the standards that have been put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| The next section is signs that are exempt from the permit requirement, so you don't have to pull a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| Currently, the code says that for sale signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| and the temporary political signs are the only ones that are exempt from the permitting requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3810)|
| 1:03:37| We've fleshed out that section quite a bit, and it's another effort of codifying some of the practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3817)|
| 1:03:48| that have been in place for a long time, such as sidewalk signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| Sidewalk signs, you know, in certain pedestrian districts, we like these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| Everybody uses them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| They don't go through the permitting process now, so we're codifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3840)|
| 1:04:08| The next section is the criteria for measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| This was a consolidation effort pulling formulas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| and standards from throughout the code into a single section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| So it lays out the mechanism and the process for determining sign area, sign height, sign spacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3863)|
| 1:04:34| how to deal with canopies over gas pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| how to determine the area of a primary building elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| One of the big changes is how we go about measuring sign height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| and we ended up with a formula that says the sign owner has the opportunity to choose whatever is best for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3885)|
| 1:04:59| whether it's the finished grade of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| or the finished grade of the roadway surface adjacent to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| so that in hilly situations, those people that are on the downhill side of a road don't have to come asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| for a variance in order to get their sign up to a level that is readable from the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| so that people have the option of using whatever is to their advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| either the finished grade or the roadway surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| The next section is on the general sign standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| Signs near the interstates, setbacks, clearance regulations, illumination, the site triangle, landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3940)|
| 1:05:48| and gas pump canopy standards are all consolidated into this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3948)|
| 1:06:00| That is primarily a consolidation effort rather than inventing new stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| The specific sign standards are, again, consolidated into a single section, temporary signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3967)|
| 1:06:18| signs near the scenic highway system, awnings, canopies, incidental signs on large campus-like tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3978)|
| 1:06:26| landmark and historic signs, electronic message centers, and changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| A lot of this language was relatively new to the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| so we've literally just picked them up from their current spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| and placed them together into a single section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| With the proposed prohibition of portable signs, we've actually removed the standards that are in the code for that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4008)|
| 1:07:02| Master sign plans are put into their own section, or as Don would prefer us to say, sign master plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| I've chosen to use the old terminology in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| We kept it pretty much intact, a little bit of minor cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| We actually had some discussion about some fairly significant changes to the master sign plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| which currently deal primarily with the granting of two additional sign types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| development directory sign and project directional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| We toyed around with the idea of creating some incentives for people to reduce other signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| in exchange for enhancing the development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| I may, in fact, recommend through the planning commission that we consider that language when it comes back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4069)|
| 1:08:00| Did you look at amortizing signs so that we can get them off in appropriate places after 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| or 15 years by amortizing the life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Amortization is a policy that many communities utilize, but which is off limits for those of us in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| Because?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Because of the state code and the grandfather law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4101)|
| 1:08:29| You're shaking your head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| So now we start to get to the meat of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| To the meat of the ordinance, signs permitted in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| This is primarily a consolidation effort to pull signs that are allowed regardless of what zone district you are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4121)|
| 1:08:54| And they're generally tied to specific types of land uses rather than the zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| Nameplates, bulletin boards, identification signs, information signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| directional signs, and signs for real estate sale and leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| We've added some standards, sign area and maximum height when the current language has been void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4150)|
| 1:09:20| or a little confusing, but really no significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| And the heart of it is the signs permitted by zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| There are seven subsections, the agricultural and open space districts, the floodway district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| historic overlay district, residential zone district, office zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| commercial and industrial zone districts are lumped together, and then the mixed use districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| The first four are relatively benign and unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| The office zone districts, there's a considerable change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| And the commercial and industrial zone districts, there is considerable change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| The current office sign regulations for the office zone districts are the most varied in the history of the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4210)|
| 1:10:23| The number of variances requested for property owners within the office districts is extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| Virtually every, well, I can't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| A lot of agendas find a lot of variance requests from signs in the office districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4233)|
| 1:10:42| It has a maximum sign area of two square feet per user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| We are sitting in a building that is in an office zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| And if you just notice the signs on the city county building, they are not two square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| And the most recent flurry of variance requests occurred with Fort Sanders Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4257)|
| 1:11:07| They recently redid their entire sign package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| and had to get a variance for every sign that they proposed in order to do what they felt was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| So our office districts are 01 is office medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4277)|
| 1:11:27| This is where hospitals are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| And the 02 is civic and institutional, land uses, lots of government buildings in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4290)|
| 1:11:45| So we've proposed generally in these districts in office going to a 5% of the building elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4305)|
| 1:11:58| primary building elevation as a total allowable sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| And I just noticed today that in the enumeration of the final product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| the maximum sign area for any individual sign has been dropped from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| So I'll go back and find the latest version that had that and put it back in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| We are proposing that with regard to detached signs, those are the monument signs, pole signs, ground signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4342)|
| 1:12:32| that the office district be allowed the opportunity to have a small pole sign along the major arterial roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4352)|
| 1:12:44| within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| Just last month we had a property owner come through with a rezoning application from 01 to C3 for the sole purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4366)|
| 1:12:57| of being allowed something other than a six-foot tall monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| This happens once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| The dialysis clinic, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Yeah, this happens once a year or so that somebody has to change their zone in order to have a relatively small sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4386)|
| 1:13:15| that competes with all of the other commercial uses along their location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| which is why we're proposing to add that particular provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| Define small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| You said small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Up to 15 feet in height, which is half of the proposed maximum height for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4410)|
| 1:13:40| Okay, that's a 36 square feet in sign area, so six by six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4420)|
| 1:13:54| The biggest change in the commercial zone districts in the way that we go about calculating total allowable sign area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4434)|
| 1:14:06| is that the current code used road frontage as the primary factor in the formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| and we have switched that from road frontage to primary building elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| with regard to the signs that are attached to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| and then we've separated from that the signs that are detached from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| We talked a lot about relationships, relationships between height and sign area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| between the sign and its setback and the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4476)|
| 1:14:44| and its location with regard to the road classification that it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| Originally, you'll recall that the recommendation coming from the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| with regard to height was to provide four alternatives depending on which type of a road you were on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4495)|
| 1:15:04| That was the main thrust of your original proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| We talked about that for many, many meetings and ultimately moved away from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| with the final recommendation of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| There are simply two different classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| The basic sign height is 30 feet, as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| with a provision that within 500 feet of the interstate interchanges that are specified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| you can go up to 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| So that represents 30 feet is a 40% reduction in the sign height from 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4536)|
| 1:15:44| 40 feet would be a 20% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| We originally carried forward those same factors for sign area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| and plugged in 165 square feet as the general maximum sign area for a detached sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4554)|
| 1:16:02| with a provision of going to 225 feet for signs near the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4562)|
| 1:16:12| Duane and I this week plugged in a number of 195 to replace that 165 number in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4572)|
| 1:16:22| which represents a 30% reduction in the general maximum sign area provision of currently it's 275 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4582)|
| 1:16:35| Why did you bump up from 165?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| I did it because Duane told me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Why did he do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| There was some feedback from business interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| and for a long time we were talking about a 30% reduction in both sign height and sign area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4609)|
| 1:17:00| and I think that stuck in a lot of people's minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| That was partly in going back and reviewing some of the notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| and what was talked about with some of the folks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| I thought it was a possibility to go ahead and put that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| Sort of a compromise number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| But it is interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| You know, Duane talked about that relationship between the history of sign permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| and where they fell on the scale with 77% of all of the permitting being less than 25 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4645)|
| 1:17:34| We did that same review of the history on sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| If I recall, it was about the same number of signs were less than 160 square feet in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4659)|
| 1:17:50| Also, I just want to interject here that when we're talking about pole signs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| presently now you have pole signs, what I refer to as the popsicle signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| but what we're talking about also in the new ordinance is that these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| you won't have a round cylinder supporting a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| There will be a rectangle or a square on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| And I forget where you put that in the ordinance, but it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| So we're no longer talking about, Nick, just the round pole going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| We're talking about forming either a rectangle or a square on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4698)|
| 1:18:32| The next section is one that we've simply reserved for future use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| which we actually had quite a bit of discussion about the creation of special sign districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| Quite often we would talk about the Bearden areas perhaps being an appropriate special district for signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4721)|
| 1:18:49| where you could come in and create an alternative set of standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| and apply it through virtually an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| Just a corridor overlay approach to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| Very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| Explain the Cumberland Avenue, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| Well, Cumberland Avenue is a form-based code that replaces all of the previous zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4745)|
| 1:19:13| but it has its own set of sign standards built into the code with a very limited menu of sign types allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4753)|
| 1:19:24| And an area could choose through a very public planning process to go that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4764)|
| 1:19:31| and utilize the special district overlay as that to incorporate those types of sign standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4771)|
| 1:19:40| Before you leave signs permitted by zone district, if I might, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| I got confused reading this because I saw a lot of references to residential areas and non-residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| but MPC has been moving gradually to mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| And so I didn't know whether that was residential or non-residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| or some hybrid that didn't fit in the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| And every time I read one of those, I kept wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| what happens in a mixed use district downtown or on Magnolia or, you know, Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| or some other corridor that is slated for that inner city mixed use approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| In several of the sections, there are provisions for residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| and provisions for non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| It's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| Our office zone districts have both uses allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| And we have a special section, Section 7, Subsection 7, which is our TC1, TND1, which are mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4831)|
| 1:20:40| And you can have residential and non-residential uses within those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| So we have to specify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4845)|
| 1:20:54| We added a section on sign construction and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| Sign maintenance was a big topic for the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| and that kind of led into a section on abandoned signs and unsafe signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| We had a lot of discussion about abandoned signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| and ended up adding a definition and beefing up the criteria for determination of when a sign is abandoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4871)|
| 1:21:21| and what you have to do with it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| And then the last three sections, the legal non-conforming signs section is relatively unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4884)|
| 1:21:32| The administration section is unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| And then we added a section in here on variances and appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| which takes language from elsewhere in the zoning ordinance and pulls it into this sign section so that, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| somebody in the sign business can have the entire process in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4907)|
| 1:21:56| That was probably way too long, but I think the new format will make it easier to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4916)|
| 1:22:05| easier to understand, and ultimately easier to change in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| and keep things relating to each other on a much better basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| Over time, the current code has just been piecemeal to death so that even those of us who are fairly familiar with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4938)|
| 1:22:28| would have trouble finding various provisions within the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| So, for me, the reorganization is probably more significant than any changes in standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4952)|
| 1:22:44| Mr. Vice Mayor, I know that we're all at seven o'clock already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| I'm not sure what the wishes of the council is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| but I did want to say that in the last couple of days we have been getting input from different folks and different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| And what my desire is is that it's not so much whether you're for it or against it as much as it is if you have comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4979)|
| 1:23:07| that we can incorporate or at least take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| And if necessary, if the sign task force needs to, you know, resume a couple of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| I certainly hope that we have a sign ordinance before I leave council in four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| But I would hope that one way that we can take comments would be for individuals to send their comments to Cindy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5001)|
| 1:23:31| as we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| I do know we have several people here that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| So what's your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Well, yeah, I mean, I think we need to get to that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| We've got eight people here that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| So I guess I'll ask for direction from the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| I think it's important if they're here that they're allowed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| I would ask that if several people have already made their point that we try to listen to new ideas on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| Yeah, and I think that's critical for us to be able to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| I mean, I think it's obvious that this is a huge task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| And, you know, I anticipate myself that there will be more than they'll be in addition to maybe public forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5050)|
| 1:24:19| and what have you, you know, some more workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| This is just a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| So I don't think we can come to finalization after just one meeting this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| So with that, I mean, are we looking at we've got eight people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| Three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| And they don't have to take all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| And I would ask, you know, let's try to not be repetitive if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| First up is former councilwoman Harlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| And I want to say that Ms. Palmer had to leave us, but she assures me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| and wants the audience assured that she will listen and watch the remainder of this on CTV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| and will not miss one second of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| No, they haven't started yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| Members of council, members of the design task force, I want to thank the task force for the work they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| It's a huge job, a difficult job, and perhaps an impossible job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| I'm someone who is in favor of sign control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| I'd like signs to be as small, as low, and as discreet, and as little sign clutter in this city as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| Unfortunately, the sign ordinance I reviewed does not accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| And let's be very clear about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| You have to be right on all of this and have it say exactly what you want it to say, because if it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5161)|
| 1:26:09| and there's some unforeseen impact, badly thought out phrase or two in the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5169)|
| 1:26:19| and someone gets a permit for a sign that complies with that law, that sign is here forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| Because of the state law, there is no taking it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| There is no buying them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| 13-7-2-0-8 is very clear, and unfortunately is what Mr. Dellivope was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| Nothing goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| So if something is wrong and is permitted under it, something we don't like, we've got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| and it's here long after all of us are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| So we have to get it right, and we have to get it right every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| There is no going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| I submitted my written comments, and those are not comments on the entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| There will be more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| There are some things that are a deal breaker for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| One of them is introducing pole signs into the office zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| And I'm sorry, I understand a two-square-foot sign on a wall is insufficient in an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5231)|
| 1:27:21| A 36-square-foot monument sign, however, is not insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| And going to a pole sign on an arterial, and I don't care if you make the base round or square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| wrap it, unwrap it, an illuminated pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| I mean, we're asking Chick-fil-A in commercial zones to put up a monument sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| and now we're going to, for the first time in OXL's history, you want to talk about sign clutter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| We're increasing, for the first time in OXL's history, allow pole signs in the office zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| You'll have permits for new pole signs in the hundreds within the first two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| Let somebody rezone if they want a pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Let's not mess up all of our office zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| To me, that's a deal killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| Mr. Donaldson pointed out that, you know, we don't have any regs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| Well, we do, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| If you're in a zone that has or requires guidelines, you can have neon signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5294)|
| 1:28:22| What the proposed ordinance does is allow neon and televisions in every window up to 25 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5302)|
| 1:28:31| or 10 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| Years ago, and you can be around too long, and I sometimes feel that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| Years ago, there was a sign task force that got rid of neon signs in windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| because they were so distracting and so unbecoming in our commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5322)|
| 1:28:55| Special design districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Please delete this section until a thoughtful conversation can take place regarding the long-term effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| of special design districts on the citywide sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| Special sign districts have the potential to weaken the ordinance by division among city areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5351)|
| 1:29:21| and by subtraction of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| At some point, we need to have high standards for the entire city, not just a few places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5364)|
| 1:29:35| Detached sign size in commercial and industrial districts, a very mechanical approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5375)|
| 1:29:42| These are poll signs and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| It seems to me a very mechanical approach has been taken in the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| in figuring out the square footage of a detached sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| I mean, I'm sorry, attached signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Ms. Malone, if you could wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| I would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Does the shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Because she's obviously put a lot of work into navigating and analyzing the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| I think it might be helpful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| I can finish up in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| Does it make sense to you that the same size detached sign for a C4 highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5413)|
| 1:30:22| and arterial district, which might have two, three hundred feet of road frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| that that same size detached sign should also be in a C1 zone, which is in our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5427)|
| 1:30:36| and they have 50 feet of frontage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| Our present zoning ordinance takes into consideration the finer grain of the distinctions among| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| and between our various commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| Right now, what's being proposed is the same size sign that you could put in an industrial zone to be in a C1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5449)|
| 1:30:57| It seems to me that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| Last but not least, the inclusion of vertical canopy areas as part of the wall area when they're over gas pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5460)|
| 1:31:13| so that the size of the sign on the wall can be larger is just, frankly, an embarrassment in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5473)|
| 1:31:23| What it means is if you have a canopy over gas pumps, and probably since you're a convenience store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| you have a small wall building elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| You need to gig it a little bit so that you can have your 10 percent as a 10 percent of a bigger area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| So let's add the vertical sides of the canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| Well, what if you're a convenience store that doesn't have gas pumps and doesn't have canopies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5506)|
| 1:31:53| Can all of us on the same size building have smaller wall signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| If what we want to do, if the point of that is to make sure that there is a minimum acceptable sign level for small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5520)|
| 1:32:09| small buildings, let's just come up with a minimum size so that people don't have to have, can't you picture it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| exaggerated vertical things, canopies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| It doesn't even specify whether it's one side or all four sides of the canopy and how big the canopy can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5542)|
| 1:32:32| Thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| My suggestion is deal with the height, deal with the size of the sign face on the pole signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| and don't act on the rest of what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| You pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| Call someone else first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| Brian Tapp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| Thank you all for all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| My name is Brian Tapp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| I live at 103 Greenbrier Drive in the Great Westwood neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| I'm also a commercial realtor and am part of the chairman of the government affairs committee for the Knox Flair Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5594)|
| 1:33:25| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| First, from the tenant's perspective and the existing owner's perspective on the abandoned signs, 60 days is too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5606)|
| 1:33:36| In commercial transactions, I wish we could sell stuff in less than 60 days, but it takes a lot longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| Typically, we'll go and market it for six months, eight months, 12 months, a year, 18 months, a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5622)|
| 1:33:50| and then you get into the transaction mode, and that takes a while, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| So to me, 60 days is not even that hard to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| We're just getting started at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| So I wish you all would take some more time to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| And then on the signs exempt from permit regulations or the permit requirements, sorry, the sizes of the square footages for commercial signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5645)|
| 1:34:18| most of them are 32 square feet or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| However, there are certain circumstances where they need to be bigger than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| and we're in the process of gathering some information from the National Association of Realtors to give a broader view of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5664)|
| 1:34:33| and help give some more feedback to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| We'd like to be involved in that process some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| And that's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| Tom Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5683)|
| 1:34:51| You're going to give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| We need Messrs. and Johnson to talk about size here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| My name is Tom Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| I live in the city at 1005 Autumn Valley Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| I appreciate you all giving us an opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| I'm addressing you all because I've already addressed the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| and I want to be sure that you all hear what my thoughts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| It's not that I think the task force isn't going to share them, but I just, everybody's got their passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| This is kind of my passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| If I've written this stuff out, I hope I can get it done in three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| If not, I hope you'll give me a minute or two longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| I had a stroke two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| I was in the hospital this morning for another procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| And the hospital, the medical team said, don't leave the house, don't drive, don't make any major decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5733)|
| 1:35:41| I'm feeling okay, but if something happens, bear with me for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| I wanted to pass out a little packet to each one of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| So if I could do that real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5750)|
| 1:35:57| Thank you, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| No, that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| That's some that I wanted to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| The other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| The other is anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| I'll just make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| I do have extra packets for anybody that's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| I do believe it's everybody's intention working on this sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| It's their intention to project, I mean, to elevate the aesthetic appearance of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5781)|
| 1:36:29| and or at least not allow it to become less attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| I personally do not believe that we live in a scruffy little city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| and certainly agree that making positive and effective actions to improve Knoxville's appearance is a plus for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| When you get your handout, for the sake of time, if you could just move on to page two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| and let me explain what the rest of the pages are there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| First off, I'm speaking primarily on an aesthetic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| If you're driving down the road, what do you see in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| If you look at the top photograph, I believe the first page is about Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| you'll see what a driver sees as they drive down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| If you look at the middle photo, you're basically looking at that same picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| but with all the business signage removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| And you can see that there's still a lot of clutter, visual clutter in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| If you look at the bottom photo, the business signs have been put back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| or in the utility poles and lines have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| And you can quickly tell that the clutter as you're driving down the streets in Knoxville, it's not the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| It's the telephone poles and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Now, I know that's not what the ordinance is here for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| but if we're going to improve the look of this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| I would like to think that we made some positive advancements or actions towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| And I'm not clear that signs is the biggest issue in our appearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| the appearance of our streets in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| I agree there are signs out there that probably shouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| They're dilapidated, abandoned, and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| I just want to appeal to you all to really consider the approach of what's best for this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| And I think that just pulling signs down is not going to help the city look good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5893)|
| 1:38:21| when you look at those pictures that I've provided there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| And I've drifted off my page, so I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| I don't think we can ask the KUB or everybody else to spend hundreds of millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| to remove its utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| But maybe as we go forward, they should be underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| You look at all the nice neighborhoods that have been built around Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| in the last several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| They're going with underground utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Because it looks better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Also, it reduces power shortages when you have ice and storm damage, trees falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| You look at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| A great job has been done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| Those utilities are underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| It looks better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| And that area, which is very attractive and is very successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| was developed under the current sign ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| And there's not a real major sign issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| So as you go forward, someday, voting on this sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| keep in mind what is really creating the clutter and the less attractive appearance of the Knoxville streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5957)|
| 1:39:25| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| My name is Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| I live at 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| Thanks for the opportunity to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| I heard a radio talk show this morning as I drove to work on the subject of supporting locally owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| A caller who owns a business in Farragut pointed out that the last year Farragut was rated number one for being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| business friendly and this year number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| The caller said allure was a big part of the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| And I thought allure, that is an odd word to use in reference to business friendliness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| But, in fact, people want to live and shop in attractive communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| The point is that lower signs are actually good for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| Not only Farragut but also Turkey Creek and the stretch of Kingston Pike between South Peters and Franklin Square are proof of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6022)|
| 1:40:30| All of these have low monument signs for different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| Farragut's law doesn't allow anything over six feet monument in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| Turkey Creek has a similar situation because of the way the developer decided to make the rules and that's how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6039)|
| 1:40:49| And, interestingly, the section of Kingston Pike that's in this example happens to be in that area between South Peters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6049)|
| 1:40:57| and Franklin Square where neighborhoods have fought very hard to keep the signs low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6057)|
| 1:41:05| I attended two of the public forums that the sign task force held and I heard many, many people speak in favor of much lower signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6065)|
| 1:41:14| I heard support for tall signs only from owners of fast food restaurants, convenience stores, gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6074)|
| 1:41:22| and motels, businesses that cater to pass-through and mostly interstate traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| These businesses who call themselves the tourism and hospitality industry have a right to lobby for tall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6088)|
| 1:41:37| And they have a very strong lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| But I believe you, our lawmakers, should not be overly influenced by this lobby and should more strongly consider the long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6099)|
| 1:41:47| interests of small business owners, homeowners, and tourists who come here not because we have a fantastic choice of fast food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6107)|
| 1:41:56| and plenty of gas stations but because of the area's allure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| Please, in particular, require much lower signage on our state roads, Kingston Pike, Broadway, Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| and others that cut through our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| I'm the president of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| Three years ago, we had 24 neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| Today, we have 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| We have thousands of houses in those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| The 30-foot recommendation for all roads other than interstate is not well received by this group at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| Over the past two-and-a-half years, we've fought 20-foot, 25-foot, and 30-foot pole signs from coming in on the stretch of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6151)|
| 1:42:39| Kingston Pike between South Peters and Franklin Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| We sent more than 1,000 emails each and letters of complaint to presidents and boards of Y12, Credit Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6164)|
| 1:42:51| and Pinnacle Bank over 25-foot pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| These two banks agreed to installing only 15-foot monument signs in both cases directly as a result of hearing from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6175)|
| 1:43:07| We are their potential customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| It wasn't fun for us to have to wage that battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| And it wasn't fun for them because it delayed them, it cost them money, it cost them bad PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6193)|
| 1:43:20| It made Knoxville look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| We need better sign laws so that people don't give the area a bad reputation because we're out there fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6202)|
| 1:43:30| Ms. Kline, you are next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| I'm almost there, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| I do want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| In the past two-and-a-half years, that whole stretch has not had anything taller than a 15-foot monument sign on any free-standing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6217)|
| 1:43:46| And this includes Chewy's Restaurant, Aldi, Gordon Food Service, $3 Car Wash, CBS, which is coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6226)|
| 1:43:55| as well as Zaxby's and Carolina Alehouse, which are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| We don't want to continue using vigilante tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| We just want you to really have a much stricter law on the height of signs on these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| David Goodson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| Thank you, David Goodson, 811 Crestville Court, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| I'm affiliated with Scenic Knoxville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| I also own an office building in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| We operate very nicely with a five-foot tombstone sign, and I've had no complaints about that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6273)|
| 1:44:41| It does, and I think Joyce and other folks have spoken to the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| there are certain businesses that will no doubt benefit and have a very strong economic interest in having taller signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| But I also think there's a good bit of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| and I want to point out one particular study that shows that large signs do create an economic burden on the community as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6293)|
| 1:45:02| and certainly that's what we ask you to do is to consider the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| I think, you know, it's all about economic incentives, and I think it's analogous to spectators at a sporting event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6307)|
| 1:45:17| If one person stands up, you know, they definitely get a better view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| But what happens, obviously, is other people stand up and all of a sudden everyone is standing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| and nobody really has a better view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| And I think what you will find with whatever sign height and controls that you put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| that new signage will quickly rise to whatever the maximum is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| I respectfully probably disagree with Mr. Greve about the self-policing of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6340)|
| 1:45:48| I think that there really will not be any incentive economically to self-police sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6348)|
| 1:45:56| Just quickly, and I'll be brief, you know, a study by urban planner Jonathan Snyder, he's an academic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6356)|
| 1:46:05| His independently vetted study in Philadelphia found, among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| certainly billboards had a very negative impact on property values in the Philadelphia area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| But the part of this study that I think is very valid and relevant to what we're talking about tonight is that he looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6376)|
| 1:46:24| multiple measures of economic prosperity in 20 cities across the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| and found that, similarly, negative financial and economic impacts from large signs exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| For cities with strict sign controls versus non-strict cities, the mean medium income is a good bit higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6395)|
| 1:46:43| 49,000 versus closer to 40,000 for those with less signage controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| The poverty rate is lower for cities that have better sign controls, less than 18% versus about 21%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6409)|
| 1:46:59| And the home vacancy rate is also much lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| So I think this confirms that having strict sign controls in the community is associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| We don't know that it's certainly not proven, but it's certainly associated with higher economic prosperity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| and a better quality of life for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| So, you know, the logic is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| Large signs, I think, create visual clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| It hurts the biggest asset we have in East Tennessee, and it's the natural beauty of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| And I hope you will consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| Members of the Council, I'm real pleased with the Gene Burr, 3621 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| I'm real pleased generally with the proposals by the sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| And I just wanted to highlight just two or three points that I thought might be of interest to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6472)|
| 1:48:00| The expanded purpose section, I don't know how many horror stories I've read about small communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6480)|
| 1:48:09| that were attacked by major sign companies because they had inadequate purpose sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6489)|
| 1:48:17| that didn't address the general health, safety, welfare of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| And those legal challenges often prevailed because of an inadequate purpose section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6502)|
| 1:48:30| I share the concern about sign height, and I thought Mr. Goodson's comments were right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6510)|
| 1:48:38| My view is that lower maximum heights assures a more orderly visual environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6518)|
| 1:48:45| and gives all the sign owners a more equitable basis for their investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| Two or three points that I observed in my last review of the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6530)|
| 1:48:58| Under temporary signs, we have the same provision we used to have under portable signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6538)|
| 1:49:05| and I'm glad that was eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| But you have two 30-day periods a year that you're allowed to have a temporary sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| But based on my reading, there's no designation of purpose associated with temporary signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6551)|
| 1:49:19| And I don't know whether that's appropriate there or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| but I would like to suggest that some association with purpose be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| Because otherwise I see this enforcement problem on these 30-day periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| as being a real problem for the sign inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| And temporary signs ought to have a purpose, you know, an opening of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| or relocation of a business or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| But I think that that would make it a little less loosey-goosey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6590)|
| 1:49:57| And personally, I think there ought to be penalties for late removal of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| that are only permitted for a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| But I don't want to be too heavy-handed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| There's one apparent discrepancy, and I may be wrong on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| I think our proposed ordinance says the height is measured to the top of the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| implies the fixed portions of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| The state allows, I think, a 20% or 25% extension for some kind of created amplification of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6626)|
| 1:50:38| And I don't think that we recognize that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| It could be a discrepancy between what the state code allows and what we allow, if I'm not mistaken on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6644)|
| 1:50:53| The extension would be above the top of the main sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| You know, like somebody's arm might extend for 20% of the sign, but I don't think ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6657)|
| 1:51:05| I see our inspectors having questions in permitting a sign that comes in with that kind of physical configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6665)|
| 1:51:16| Otherwise, I think it's a noble effort, and I'm delighted that we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| And I hope sanity prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| Lisa Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6690)|
| 1:51:45| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| My name is Lisa Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| I live at 1065 Scenic Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| I'd just like to say that I appreciate the task force and all the hard work they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6710)|
| 1:51:56| I do respectfully disagree, though, in regards to the sign height and the sign area that they are allowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6716)|
| 1:52:07| I have a suspicion that if you've lived in Knoxville for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| it's not as shocking to see the signs as opposed to somebody that is just coming into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6733)|
| 1:52:24| I moved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| I moved to Knoxville two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| And prior to living here as an adult, I lived in Indianapolis, Indiana, Columbus, Ohio, Burlington, Vermont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6748)|
| 1:52:37| Portland, Maine, Salt Lake City, Utah, and a suburb of Chicago, all mid-sized towns, not so dissimilar from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6757)|
| 1:52:50| But two things stood out when we interviewed here, my husband and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| Number one, the beauty of East Tennessee, and secondly, the urban blight caused by the commercialization of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6775)|
| 1:53:05| It was actually very shocking to us when we drove through Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| It reminds me very much of a grand house filled with children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| and the children were left without boundaries by the parents to do whatever they wanted to that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6795)|
| 1:53:22| A house full of children is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| I have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| But they have to have boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| And commercialization is good, but it has to have boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| And you all are Knoxville's parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| There has been no other city where I've lived that has left commercialization so unbounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| The cities in which we have lived were prosperous and thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| They were desirable places to live because they had strong regulations at their core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| East Tennessee is one of the most beautiful places on this planet, but Knoxville is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6832)|
| 1:53:59| In fact, it's the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| Knoxville to us was an undesirable place to live because of its urban blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| not caused by poor neighborhoods or industrialization, but by the commercialization and all the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6848)|
| 1:54:16| which is thought to be a good thing, but too much of a good thing is just simply too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6856)|
| 1:54:23| and everything good needs boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| If the boundaries are the same for all those involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| then all levels of play will stay the same as they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| Knoxville is not unique in its financial prosperity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| but I can tell you from experience that it is unique in its commercial urban blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| Mr. Redman, last call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6884)|
| 1:54:57| Mr. Vice Mayor, Members of Council, thank you very much for having this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| My thanks to the members of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| It's a long and so far unthankless job, but it is appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| Your efforts are appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| Having appreciated the efforts, we still need to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| I have been standing in Kroger's 15 years ago handing out petitions to ban billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6916)|
| 1:55:24| along with Citizen Delamope up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| I've been in the sign control business a long time in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| and not much has changed, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| If we don't do anything better, first rule of medicine, let's do no harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| Let's don't clutter up the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| One thing that makes the office zone so nice and quiet, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6942)|
| 1:55:48| as opposed to commercial, is the lack of signage cluttering up everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| Don't start putting poll signs up in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| Let's think very, very hard about special sign zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| That speaks to the attitude of this town, and until we figure out what we're going to do with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6961)|
| 1:56:07| it would be good to leave them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| I encourage the sign committee to not make this their final hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| that if they're going to bring a product through, they need to work on it some more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| I think from the comments that they've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| That is all the folks that have signed up for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| I guess I would defer to Mr. to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| I'm very sorry because I know it's late, and I had not signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| And this is just to make a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| My name is Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| I am a member of the League of Women Voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| and I'm the chair of the Land Use and Environment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| But I am speaking here as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| I want to make a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| Councilman Grieve very graciously referred to some information that I gave him on various definitions of consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7019)|
| 1:57:09| from a strong sense of consensus to what would be considered to be a very weak sense of consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| I want to clarify that that was from me as a professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| It was not the League of Women Voters position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| So we will have comments at further meetings on the signed ordinance itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7044)|
| 1:57:29| but I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| Mr. Grieve, how would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| I think that it's obvious that we've gotten some very good comments this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| And as I mentioned to you earlier, we're getting comments by e-mails, which we'll continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| And I think what I would like to recommend is that we take a look at what comments that we've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7069)|
| 1:57:57| and what we're seeing and reconvene the committee, if they're willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| and see about the possibility of not only reviewing what has been brought forth tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7082)|
| 1:58:08| but also I think it's imperative from the standpoint of where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| and what we've come up with that we at least have another public forum on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| And so I think that would be one thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| I would like very much to hear from council your comments, not tonight, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| your written comments that if you would get those to Cindy, we would very much appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| And I think it's important that we let the citizens know that the proposed draft is on the Web site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7111)|
| 1:58:39| and that we definitely want to entertain additional comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| I think several of the speakers tonight, one of the points that they made is that we want to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7123)|
| 1:58:49| I think the other thing that we want to do is we do want to have a sign ordinance that is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| I think that we're probably to be realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| We're not going to get everything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| But I think we're all, you know, on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| And I hope that we can at least come to some agreement in terms of the revitalization of a sign ordinance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7142)|
| 1:59:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| Yeah, just a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| Mark Donaldson, is this going to MPC next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| I mean, is that where this is headed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| We have it scheduled on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| If the task force chooses to meet again, we certainly can postpone or table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| I was just curious because it sounded like they were thinking about several revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| And if you go ahead and pass what you've sent us, then we're in the old situation of do we then modify your work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| and get back to you and get, you know, the back and forth thing going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7180)|
| 1:59:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| I think you're going to be in that battle anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| So I think you let it go to MPC and then come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| We have more public forum and then we can, you know, hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| I think by letting it go to MPC is that we'll definitely get their feedback also at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| And I think, as George says, I think it's probably going to go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| This is something that's not going to be finished immediately on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| I mean, what's sort of the time frame that you all are thinking moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| Because it feels like I'd hate to torture the task force any more than it's already been tortured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7221)|
| 2:00:28| And as well as the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| and interested parties to try to get an idea of when we might be potentially voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7230)|
| 2:00:41| Well, I mean, you've got to have another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| You've already got one scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| Spring time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| Spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| Hope spring's eternal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Marshall, if you think about it, we're talking about, and, again, I want to talk to the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| we're talking about reviewing what has come out in the last couple of days and what's come out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7258)|
| 2:01:05| I think we have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| I think that it's obvious that we do want to have another public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| I've had some discussions with the vice mayor about the, because of the complexity of what this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7270)|
| 2:01:16| that it seems to me that we might want another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| I know we're not crazy about that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| I mean, I think we should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| But I think this is something that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| So if you think about that from a time frame, and then you think about it's got to go to NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| and once NPC again goes through it, then it comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| I'm saying realistically, you're thinking, I mean, we're thinking springtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| I mean, I hate to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| I mean, that's not my desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| But at the same time, I think with all the time and effort that's been put into this, that this is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7301)|
| 2:01:48| Well, I certainly agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| And I guess my comments, I'm not a, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| I think we should have as many workshops as needed as council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| I guess my concern is, and I'm very thankful for the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| but I think ultimately a lot of these major hard decisions like sign heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| and square footage are going to have to be ultimately decided by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| So instead of just sort of kicking it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| I just don't want to get a situation to try to kick it back to them to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| because that was a lot of the comments were tonight when ultimately this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| the nine members on this body will be probably going to either accept or change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7339)|
| 2:02:26| I just think, and I didn't want to just keep putting this on to the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7346)|
| 2:02:33| That was my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Well, I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| I mean, that's the last thing I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| But I think that what we can do is within the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| or so is to really look at what those priority items are that council really needs to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| A lot of things that have been developed and worked on the ordinance that I think everyone's in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| But I think that also what we can do and report back to council is that here are the key issues which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7371)|
| 2:02:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| Yeah, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| But I do think that now that the ordinance is in the condition that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| and it's been put on the website, I personally would like to see additional public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| if there are other items and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| We know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| We pretty well know what the key issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| And so I think that will give us an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| So, you know, my desire is to do it as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| But I can't give you an exact date now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| I will say this, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| I'm certainly not interested in reviewing any other ordinances in our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| Mr. Frost has a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7419)|
| 2:03:40| I'd like to mention this to the chairs of the task force and maybe Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| I do not have the ordinance in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| but just thinking it must be acted upon by council within 120 days of final action by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7426)|
| 2:03:55| So I understand the need and the desire to make the ordinances as good as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7435)|
| 2:04:05| but I'm not sure, you know, you've got when you go through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7445)|
| 2:04:10| you need to be keeping that time frame in the back of your mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| because if it's not acted upon, the effect is of a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| So in other words, yeah, and I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| If MPC looks at it in January, we have three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| Well, it's actually on, as Mr. Donaldson said, the December MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7463)|
| 2:04:30| Of course, we've had it on how many meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| We've had it on MPC I don't know how many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| It may already be dead and starting all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| No, final action of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| We started a new application last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| and the ordinance reads that from the date of the last public hearing of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7482)|
| 2:04:50| So if we were to table it while the task force meets again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| then we would pull it back and have a public hearing that would then trigger the 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7495)|
| 2:05:04| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| In 120 days, what we're both saying we think is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| Well, not to add to the time, I certainly want to thank you, Mr. Chairman and Vice Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| and everybody on the task force because you've worked on it long and hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| The only question I have during the different meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| did you feel like you got a pretty good cross-section of the different neighborhood organizations across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7524)|
| 2:05:31| to come out and speak to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| Did you get that sense or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7534)|
| 2:05:41| It may be hard to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| I think it is hard to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| I think it's like, you know, it's like a number of issues that we deal with on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7543)|
| 2:05:51| that it depends on the issue and how it hits the individuals and whether they're passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| And I think that this is a situation where there are a number of people who are extremely passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| They're passionate about their city and the love for their city and what their city looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| But I also think there's a number of folks who just think, well, we're doing another sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| And so that would be hard for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| I don't know, maybe George, you know, gets a different feel for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| We'll be more than happy to share with you the 40-some people that did speak at public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| I was just curious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| But I really want to thank you for your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| I'm going to suggest that listening to all the comments around the table here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| that it would be really helpful to this task force if we had some, perhaps not tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7591)|
| 2:06:38| but some non-binding discussion amongst the nine members of council about what we see as important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7598)|
| 2:06:44| and what we have questions so when they go back to the table, they can at least be looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7604)|
| 2:06:49| Because otherwise they're just shooting in the dark and it doesn't seem like it adds much to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| As Marshall mentioned, at some point the policy question comes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| And instead of drafting against a blank wall with four sides that could be something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| they might benefit from a little cross discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| And this might not be the night to do it, but we ought to try to do that and aid their effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| If you could do something like that in, you know, in January, that would certainly help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| We presently have available to you the council Internet forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7638)|
| 2:07:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| So, well, I mean, that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| Well, I don't know of any further business this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| I want to thank council for not only the workshop but for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| And I definitely want to thank the people that spoke, that brought forth their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| And, again, I want to thank the task force members and the staff folks that have helped us so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| And I'm hoping they'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131205?start=7681)|
