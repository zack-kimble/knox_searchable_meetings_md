| 0:01:09| Mr. Wallace is traveling, and I talked with Brenda earlier, and she is ill, and will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| not be joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| Before we get with the presentation, I want to just announce if there's anyone that wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=77)|

| 0:01:33| Mr. Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| We're so glad you're here to celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| You can drink now, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| Couldn't think of a better way to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| That's why we're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| With my colleagues at City Council discussing alternative financial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Also, I want to remind Council that on Tuesday night, we'll have dinner, and Dr. Lyons and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| Charles Swanson and Cliff Rogers will be joining us for dinner to speak about election schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| It's still at 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| It's still at 6, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Election schedules and possible composition of the makeup of the election of the at-large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| and the City Council reps on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| That will be Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| We're also tentatively put on your calendars July 14th for a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| We have a very tight schedule for the changes that might take place, especially with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| scheduling aspect that the administration's interested in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| Also, we'd just like, I'm sure some of you know, but I just want to kind of digress for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| a minute here and just let everyone know that Ms. Pelow, who used to be on Council with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| us for those eight years, her daughter passed away this past Saturday, and the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| are actually today and this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| Do you know what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| So, we certainly give her our condolences, and we're thinking of the family and Barbara| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| as they go through this ordeal on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Was there a poll sent out on this workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| I'm digressing a little bit on July 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| The administration had asked if we would have one due to the scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Wouldn't it generally be protocol to poll the members of Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| It sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| That's why I said tentatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Is that the same evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Will just said that that's the evening that Pat Summitt's memorial service is also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| So, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| For the presentation this evening on alternative financial services, according to the schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| here, Gerald, we start with you with MPC, or are we going to start with Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| Yeah, I'm going to kick things off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| You're going to kick things off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| My name is Krista Summitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| As you know, we're here tonight to talk about alternative financial services and the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| that's been proposed and recommended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| We don't have the long cords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| I'm just going to reach over here and change slides a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| You should have this PowerPoint presentation in front of you so you can follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| As far as what we're going to cover, briefly I'm going to touch on the background, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| then Jeff is going to touch on some more of the background, kind of how we got into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| He's going to talk about the MPC report that was generated in the fall of last year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| talk about what they found there and what MPC ultimately recommended for our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Then I'm going to talk about case law and analysis, covering some things such as preemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| and the new federal rules that have been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Then Charles, who will be here a little bit later, is going to talk about policy considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| as you all move forward in making your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| What are we talking about as far as alternative financial services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| It's a pretty broad term, but generally it refers to providers of financial services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| who operate outside of the established realm of traditional federally insured financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| services, so not banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| Examples would include check cashing outlets, money transmitters, car title lenders, payday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| loan stores, pawn shops, quick loan companies, and businesses of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| I will say one thing that's a little bit challenging in regulating these types of businesses is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| that they are so varied and they do so many different things, but it's obviously a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| large industry, as you can see in this chart here, handling $320 billion per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=352)|
| 0:06:02| The point on the left is to reiterate what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| There's really a lack of a universal term for these types of businesses, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| very different in how they operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| I will hand it over to Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| He's going to talk about the MPC report and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Do you know how many are here in this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Yeah, I'll go into that, into the report, and I have some maps towards the end that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| also in the report, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| To kind of give you a little overview as far as where we came from, we developed, at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| request of city council, a background report as far as studying AFS in Knoxville and looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| at the industry and what potential recommendations could be, and provided that to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| Then, as a second step in the process, city council asked us to develop a zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| recommendation based on the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Looking at the overview as far as the regulatory landscape, I think pretty much everybody would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=423)|
| 0:07:14| agree that probably zoning wouldn't be the best mechanism to address this, but a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| of communities in Tennessee and around the United States are developing zoning regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| because there's an absence of federal and state regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| Some states control it more than Tennessee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| I would say for the environment compared to other places across the country that Tennessee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| regulations are more permissive as far as these uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| The thing to kind of keep in mind with this, it's a rapid evolving kind of industry, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| like everything in our lives, technology is actually playing a role in it, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| becoming more online services and phone services and things like this where it's actually one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| on one instead of an institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| One of the things we looked at as far as the report is studying our kind of sister communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| within Tennessee and looking at Nashville's ordinance, Memphis, and Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| To give you a little bit of an overview as far as where they are, they all have alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| financial service ordinances, and Memphis started in 2008, and they came up with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=507)|
| 0:08:38| own definition, their own local definition of what alternative financial services are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| and those include payday loans and title loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| Chattanooga did a report similar to ours in 2006 where they looked at a little more as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=529)|
| 0:09:00| far as the economics and what the crime was of those related uses, and they found basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| it's inconclusive that there is no relationship as far as crime and property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| But they turned around in 2014 and developed an ordinance, and they use a quarter mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| distance from another alternative financial service, and they use 500 feet buffer from residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=563)|
| 0:09:32| Let me back up on Memphis again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| They have a distance requirement, too, of 1,000 feet from another alternative financial service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| and a quarter mile from a landmark or residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| Nashville developed theirs in 2014 after Chattanooga and basically used the report from Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=587)|
| 0:09:58| in their adoption of their ordinance, and they took a little bit different approach as far as Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=598)|
| 0:10:08| and they broke out pawnbrokers, so they have a quarter mile from another pawnbroker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| so it's not lumping them all into AFS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| They separated out pawnbrokers as their separate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| Okay, next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| So one of the things we looked at as far as the report, as far as the location and the type of alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| financial service, if there is a clustering, where is this clustering happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| We compared it against the incomes as far as the neighbor, their census tracts, and where are these located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| as far as the incomes of the people, and looking at separation standards and eligible areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=645)|
| 0:10:58| So the first slide, these slides are in the back of your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| They might be a little bit more legible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| The first one is talking about location and type, and so there are 81 total establishments licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=666)|
| 0:11:17| through Tennessee when this report was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| And if we break them down as far as the different types of alternative financial services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| deferred presentment services would be 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Title pledge lenders would be 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Cash checkers, I'm sorry, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| Pawnbrokers, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Now, there's a lot of these services that are cross-licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| They're holding more than one license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| The numbers I gave to you just there are if they're holding an exclusive license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| Now, there's 45 that are holding a cross-license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| That's why probably when I said pawnbrokers are three, you're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| what, there's more than three pawnbrokers in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| That's why there's a lot of them that have multiple license to cash checks and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| so they come into multiple services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| So typically, looking at payday loans, they're loans for small amounts of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| They typically come due the next payment, next payday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| and they must give lenders access to the checking account or write a check for the full balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| in advance that the lender has an option of depositing when the loan comes due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=750)|
| 0:12:39| Looking at Tennessee's law, the APR is 459%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=759)|
| 0:12:51| If we go to the next slide, we looked at the location of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| and this is showing the concentration of areas, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| One of the things that you asked us to look at in your resolution is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| is there a clustering and we wanted to present where those clusterings were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| The highest concentration is found actually on Clinton Highway and Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| That intersection has seven existing alternative financial services within 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| So if you stand at that intersection and look at all corners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| you can see an alternative financial service establishment right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| There are other concentrations, too, places that you would think as far as Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| Broadway, Kingston Pike, Magnolia, Western Avenue, Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=818)|
| 0:13:48| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| This is the slide basically looking at income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| One of the things that sometimes is thought is that these are in low-income areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| but really it's kind of the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| It's more the working poor that you could see that the inner area has less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=842)|
| 0:14:11| Those red dots represent an alternative financial service location, existing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| We compared this against the median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| Median income between 2008 and 2012 for the city was $33,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| Then we used HUD's definition as far as looking at low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| and they defined low income as 80% of the median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| So then we basically mapped these out as far as these census tracts to figure out where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| So the lighter colors in blue are less than 80% of the median income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| and as you go up in green, they became more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| and then the most is more than 120% of the median income in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=899)|
| 0:15:08| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| So we looked at separation standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| and developed looking at some of our counter cities in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| as far as what a good spacing requirement would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| and a lot of them will either use 1,320, which is a quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| They use 1,000 or 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| I'll use one of those three measurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| So we thought looking at that as the spacing was probably the easier to administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=937)|
| 0:15:46| than to get down to 1,320,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| and we actually compared, and there wasn't much of a difference using 1,000 or using 1,320.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=949)|
| 0:15:58| So if you look at if you had a 1,000-foot separation standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| from just an alternative financial service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| so basically if you knew, say there was an ordinance on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| that had just the 1,000 separation from an existing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| then there would be 1,194 parcels that would be eligible or 903 acres in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=975)|
| 0:16:26| And if you took the 1,000 foot from just residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| and say you just had that component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| that would leave you 258 parcels and 337 acres available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=993)|
| 0:16:44| Now if you combine the two and you have 1,000 foot from existing alternative financial service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| and 1,000 feet from residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| that brings the number down to 207 parcels or 225 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| The majority of those areas are indicated on blue in this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| and there's some zoomed-in areas in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| And there is actually a little typo on one of those reports on page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| Instead of saying, I believe it says Strawberry Plains in your version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| it should say Chapman Highway on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| So after all this analysis, we came up with basically the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| The definition as far as alternative financial service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Chattanooga and Nashville refer back to Tennessee code annotated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| so that they have to be licensed through the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| And basically we used that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Memphis came up with their own definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| We saw the strength as far as connecting it to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1074)|
| 0:18:02| And we have the recommendation of both the 1,000 foot separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| from existing alternative financial service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| and 1,000 feet from residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| And if you look as far as our current zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| where we thought it would fit for use on review would be our C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| which is just our general commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| our C4, which is our highway and arterial commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| and C6, which is our general commercial park district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| Now as far as our plan zones, SC2 and SC3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1117)|
| 0:18:46| which are our community and regional shopping center districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| just depending on the scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| and our PC1, which is our retail and office park district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| And then I'll turn it back over to Krista for the legal presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| Before you leave that, what happens if you have this new mixed-use zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| There's only one CX commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Does that mean it's in any of those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| Within those mixed-use zones, it will be a hybrid ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| in that there will be some form or design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| as well as use restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| There will be a table of permitted uses in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| And as proposed now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| the payday lending is not identified as a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| in either the CX or NX, the commercial mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| or the neighborhood mixed-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| So as I mentioned at the outset of the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| I'm going to cover the legal stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| including preemption, Tennessee statutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| and how those may or may not be preempted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| and federal regulations that were just published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| So first I want to talk a little bit about preemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| It's a concept that you're likely familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| but it's just the idea that when you have legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| that's passed by a higher authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| it takes precedence over and trumps a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| that's passed by a lower authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| And it can be expressed or implied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| Sometimes there are explicit statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| evidencing the authority's intent to occupy the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| and sometimes you have to infer that from the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| And preemption is the most common form of a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| to alternative financial service ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| And these arguments do take a variety of forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| but typically occur where a local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| is imposing licensing requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| or is creating parameters such as interest rate caps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| which is sort of an area that's generally left to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| A few ordinances that have been overturned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| on the basis of preemption have been in Oakland, California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| St. Anne, Missouri, Cleveland and Dayton, Ohio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| and Hempstead, New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| And I'll talk a little bit more about the Hempstead case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| Before you go there, are we talking about distance separation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Are we talking about regulating the business activity itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| Well, preemption has sort of taken challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| have existed in all of those contexts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Including the zoning aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| And this case that I'm going to talk about was one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| So in Hempstead, they limited cash-checking businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| to certain districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| and essentially prohibited the use in most districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| And so the court looked to the state law provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| on check-cashing businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| which related to the licensing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| and application requirements for the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| So the rules that existed in the state of New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| required a business plan to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| to the state superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| And the state superintendent would evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| the appropriateness of the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| of the alternative financial service in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| So the court found this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| about the state superintendent's evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| to be clear evidence that the state superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| and not the local government was responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| for determining the appropriate location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| for check-cashing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| So the zoning regulation in Hempstead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| was found to be preempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| And so Hempstead appealed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| to the intermediate court in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| And the court upheld the finding of preemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| and emphasized that this was an abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| of Hempstead's zoning power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Okay, so I'm going to talk about our statutes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| and possibilities of preemption challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| So alternative financial services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| as Jeff mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| we've defined those using the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| found in the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| So we've got deferred presentment, title pledges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| pawnbrokers, and check-cashing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| And these are found in Title 45 of our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| So I'm going to cover each one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| in a little bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| So first we've got the deferred presentment services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| And this is the idea that Jeff mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| where you give someone a check and they hold it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| and then they later cash it if you don't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| what it was that you were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| So the Tennessee Code on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| from the business requires a proof of minimum net worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| and financial stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| And it states that the business of deferred presentment services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| conducted in accordance with the Tennessee Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| shall not be subject to or controlled by any other statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| governing the imposition of interest, fees, or loan charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| So what this is saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| no other Tennessee Code provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| can sort of trump the interest provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| on deferred presentment services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| So that's not really a statement of preemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| that would apply to the local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| That's just sort of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| when we're talking about deferred presentment services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| these are the only regulations that would apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| not any other Tennessee Code provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Do we have deferred presentment businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| That's a service that's provided here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Title pledges are located in Chapter 15 of Title 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| And I think this is a very prominent preemption statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| and I'll read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| It says no incorporated municipality, city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| or taxing district in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| shall enact an ordinance or resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| or promulgate any rules or regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| relating to this chapter, being Chapter 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Provisions of any ordinance or resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| or rules or regulations of any municipality, city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| or taxing district relative to Title Pledge lending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| are superseded by the provisions of this chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| So I think that's an explicit preemption statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| noting that this chapter on Title Pledges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| is the only law that can exist as relates to Title Pledges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| Is that different than Hempstead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| which seemed to say they decided where you could do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| that it was a convenience and advantage of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| Does our statute do anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| or do they not touch where you can practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| as opposed to the rules of how you practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| So I think this is a broader statement than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| because it's sort of saying as it relates to Title Pledges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| the state gets to pass all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Takes the only rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| So I do think it's a broader statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| and could pose some problems for us in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| As far as the next two, I'll skim through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| because I don't think that there's a preemption problem there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| as significant as there is with the Title Pledging section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| So the Pawnbroker Act does provide that local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| are prohibited from enacting certain regulations on pawnbrokers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| but it doesn't speak to location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| So as far as our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| I don't think we have to be too worried there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| And then finally, the Check Cashing Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| speaks to the location of these types of businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| stating basically that they can operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| where there's another licensed business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| which is, I think, just talking about its association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| with another type of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| I think that our local zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| could still come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| I don't think that that constitutes a preemption statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| There's a couple other cases moving on past Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| and past that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| So we've got Missouri Title Loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| versus St. Louis Board of Adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| And in that case, the local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| had passed a zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| where they reviewed alternative financial services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| as uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| And in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| they denied the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| saying that basically it was not in the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| And that denial was upheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| and they had a distinction in their ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| between alternative financial services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| and traditional financial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| And so I think that case could be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| as far as making a distinction in our ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| between traditional banking services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| and alternative financial services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| but they didn't get into a consideration of distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| In the next case, they did get into distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| and this is Remen Check Cashing Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| versus New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| So in this case, the state of New Jersey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| passed a check casher regulatory act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| that treated check cashing businesses differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| than other types of financial services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| and it imposed a distance restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| on those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| And that act was upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| It was found to be kind of a rational exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| of governmental power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I think the distinction between our circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| and the Remen Check Cashing case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| is that was an action taken by the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| as opposed to a local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Okay, so now I'm going to shift gears entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| and talk about the new federal regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| that have been published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| And as a bit of background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| the 1990s was sort of a free-for-all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| in the field of payday lending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| It became deregulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| and so states were rolling back use-free caps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| and changes in federal laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| allowed lenders to avoid certain caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| So by 2008, we had a huge number of payday loan services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| and alternative financial services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| outnumbering McDonald's restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| and Starbucks coffee shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| which I thought was an interesting statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| So in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| was created to address kind of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| all of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| following the start of the Great Recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| And so they are now proposing rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| for short-term small-dollar lenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| And they have published several reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| and documents on their rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| and these are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| at the end of your PowerPoint presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| which Will is going to send to you in a digital version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| And so there's hyperlinks in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| and you can go and look at these resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| and I would recommend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| because what they found is very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| And one of the things that they found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| was 67% of borrowers...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Sorry, 67% went to borrowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| with seven or more transactions a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| and the majority of borrowers paid more in fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| than the amount of their initial loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| So that's just in fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| being more than the initial amount of their loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| Okay, so kind of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| just the basics of these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| They were published at the beginning of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| and so right now their proposed rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| open for public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| and that comment period ends September 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| And you can find the rules online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| again, through the hyperlink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| If you've got a lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| it's 1,300 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| So, you know, if you're looking for something to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| over the long weekend...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| And the Bureau is acting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| under the authority of the Dodd-Frank Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| which was passed in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| again, as a sort of reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| to the Great Recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| And to give you a sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| sort of the gist behind the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| this is sort of an introductory statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| in one of their publications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| So it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| The Bureau is concerned that lenders that make covered loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| have developed business models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| that deviate substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| from the practices in other credit markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| by failing to assess consumers' ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| to repay loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| and by engaging in harmful practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| in the course of seeking to withdraw payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| from consumers' accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| So that can sort of give you a hint of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| their take on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| And so we'll get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| the specifics as to what they're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| as far as protections for consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| Okay, so the rules are addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| two types of loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| short-term and long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| And those are defined...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| Short-term are defined as 45 days or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| including typical 14-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| and 30-day payday loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| as well as short-term vehicle loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| that are made for 30-day terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| And then there's also the longer-term loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| more than 45 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| where the inclusive APR is greater than 36%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| And the lender has access within 72 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| to a leveraged payment mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| So that might be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| some sort of collateral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| like a car title or access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| to a checking account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| or some sort of paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| The Bureau is excluding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| a couple types of consumer credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| from the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| So home mortgages or other loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| secured by real property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| credit cards, student loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| non-recourse pawn loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| and overdraft services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| and lines of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| So the rules...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| When these rules go to what they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| as part of their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| do they talk about where they can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| zoning-type stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| They do not have, as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| a limitation on the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| of these types of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| It's really talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| how they can operate their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| So they could have a big activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| in the field as the feds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| but not affect zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| As of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| I would believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| that to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| It doesn't look like they're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| to preempt state or local government...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| It's not the where, it's how they do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| So the rules impose some protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| as far as evaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| a consumer or customer's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| to repay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| And the first one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| the full payment test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| which is basically looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| all of a consumer's bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| and obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| expenses like food and utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| and evaluating those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| in the context of the loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| and determining whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| they'll be able to pay it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| after they've paid all those other bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| So that's during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| the term of the loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| and also for 30 days afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| And after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| a lender has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| a specific type of loan to a customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| they can't make the same type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| loan to that customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| unless their financial situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| has materially improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| As an alternative to the full payment test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| there's a principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| payoff option, and this is an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| on loans of $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| or less, and the Bureau has sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| used that number as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| kind of a less risky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| number or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| cost of loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| So they've developed a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| way to go about it for these types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| of loans that still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| provides protection for consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| option would require the debt to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| repaid either in a single payment or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| with up to two extensions where the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| is paid down at each step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| And lenders would be barred under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| option from taking auto title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| as collateral and from structuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| the loan as open-end credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| And the proposal would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| a lender to provide notice before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| making a loan under the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| payoff option. And these notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| to the customer must use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| plain language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| to kind of just cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| all of the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| And there's a few other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| that are in the rules that I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| to highlight that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| consumer protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| First, lenders have to use a credit reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| system to report and obtain information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| about loans made under the full payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| test or the principal payoff option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| So once these rules went into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| if a consumer had engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| another lender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| and had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| used one of these payment options to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| pay off its loan, that information would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| available to them, and they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| have to act accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| Also, longer-term loan options would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| available under tight parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| again to reduce riskiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| And these two options are using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| the National Credit Union administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| standards, which cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| the interest rate at 28%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| and require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| an application fee of no more than $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| we've got the stable repayment with low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| default penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| And so that basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| means that there's kind of even payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| amounts over the life of the loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| the projected default rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| can't be more than 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| And then finally, there's a penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| fee prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| provision. And I thought this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| really interesting data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| backing up this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| So consumers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| who engage in this type of lending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| are charged $185| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| in bank penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| from debit failures or overdrafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| More than one-third of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| borrowers with a failed payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| ultimately lose their bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| So what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| happens in these scenarios is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| a person has put up their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| bank account as collateral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| and it's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| for their payment to be due and the lender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| accesses their bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| account, there's not enough money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| and so their bank account is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| overdrawn, they're charged fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| They do it again. More fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| more, you know, overdrawing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| the account. And they keep doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| until they've racked up an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| enormous amount of fees. And so if we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| someone who is using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| this type of financial service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| you know, that's certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| not helpful to them. So this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| addressing that problem and requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| written notice before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| the loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| the lender is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| access the account. And it's a three-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| written notice to the consumer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| And then after two unsuccessful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| attempts of withdrawing from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| account, the lender is prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| from attempting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| to withdraw again unless they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| a new authorization from the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| And that is all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| I have. I'm going to turn it over to Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| Before you leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| there were three cities that Jeff was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| talking about, the major cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Nashville, Memphis, and Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| They're regulating distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Are they affected by these new rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| or are they just parallel universes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| One says these businesses have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| to have better practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| and local governments are saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| you can't be too close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Right, that's sort of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| they're parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| I mean, so the federal government is looking at how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| the businesses are operating and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| our nearby jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| well, we're not going to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2313)|

| 0:38:37| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| I've got a question then also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| This takes effect possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| in September, these new rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| No, that's when the comment period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| closes. So then the BR is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| take those comments, incorporate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| as it sees fit, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| publish them in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| final version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Do they have any idea how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| these rules may close down a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| number of these places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| I don't know if that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| information that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I think it's really getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| at a consumer protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| shut down or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| prevent new businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| from opening up. I think it's really just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| focused on the consumer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Vice Mayor, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Did I hear you say that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| a limit on the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| interest that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| charged with the payday lenders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Is that a federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| regulation or state or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| In one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| options, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| second option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| that's being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| there's an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| within that option that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| you to lend at a higher amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| if you follow certain parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| One of them is a cap on interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Is that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| federal or state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| That's a federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| regulation proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| questions for Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| First,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| if I may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| take a personal moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| you may have noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| I was late getting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| The reason I was late getting here is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| I was coming from Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| your former colleague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| Barbara Pelow, she lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| her daughter Laurie. I was out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| there and she asked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| to convey to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| that she loves you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| and that she appreciates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| Throughout this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| very difficult situation, she has maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| her sense of humor because she wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| you to know that she's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| hold it against every one of you that you would hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| a city council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| at the same time that she was having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| her receiving of friends. That was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| joke and she wanted to make sure that you knew that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| it was a joke. She has maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| her sense of humor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| and wanted to convey her best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| to you and to let you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| know that she understands that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| you have your obligations with this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Don't feel badly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| about it, she says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Having completed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| see on the slide, it says I'm going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| preemption. I'll talk about preemption a little bit because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| I think Chris has done a great job with preemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| The question you want to ask me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| is, are you preempted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| from passing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| legislation by what we've seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Well, if you look at what's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| by the feds, what has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| been proposed so far, as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| look at that, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| your particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| form of regulation here would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| be preempted by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| It doesn't appear to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| that the feds are attempting to occupy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| the entire field with regard to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| it doesn't seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| to me that there are regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| proposed by the feds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| would prohibit you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| from having some type of supplementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| regulations in addition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| what they might do. So do I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| think you would be preempted by these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| fed regs or these proposed fed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| regs? Probably not by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| those. Are you preempted by any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| state law? More difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| question to answer. I think there's the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| statute that Krista referred to earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| an argument could be made that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| regard to the title loan situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| an argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| could be made that the feds are trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| to occupy the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| field, not the feds, but the state is trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| to occupy the field in that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| area and doesn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| local municipal governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| to engage in regulation in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| that area. So there could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| an argument made there. I could argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| the other side of it. I mean, you try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| to be a good lawyer, you can argue both sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| So I can't tell you definitively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| that even with regard to that one specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| portion of it that you would necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| be preempted. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| are things that you need to be aware of, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| preemption statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Let me tell you more about what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| think I do know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| which is precious little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| But what I do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| in the field of municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| in the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Tennessee, municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| only have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| in ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| that have been delegated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| to them by the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Tennessee. All of the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| of the city of Knoxville is authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| that's delegated to it by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| the state of Tennessee. And you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| have any authority to enact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| ordinances or resolutions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| is not delegated to you by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Now, some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| is a very general delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Some of it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| more specific delegation of authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| In this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| clearly you do not have a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| delegation of authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| to enact regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| in this field. So the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| becomes, do you have sufficient general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| delegated authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| And I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| I really don't know the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| to that. You do have authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| to enact zoning regulations, no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| about that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| in examining the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| that's delegated under those zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| regulations, it certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| appears to me that a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| argument could be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| that what you are delegated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| to do in terms of exercising your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| police power using the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| is to regulate the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| of land, the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| of things, how they're utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| in some ways, heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| it's essentially to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| adverse impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| in the area within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| which you are zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| That's, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| the reason why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| when we adopt our adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| business regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| we have to be able to prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| before we can regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| those businesses or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| before we can separate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| businesses out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| exclude them from being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| clustered together as these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| businesses are clustered together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| you have to prove that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| adverse impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| that will affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| the area in which they are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| You're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| porn, not pawn, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Yeah. I'm talking about porn as opposed to pawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| But the things that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| show is that there's an increasing crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| that you have an aggregation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| of people who may be publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| intoxicated. You can show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| you have to get studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| you have to get studies that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| specific to this issue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| show that there are adverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| impacts that you are addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| by your utilization of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| power and you're trying to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| adverse impacts within the particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| area where you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| utilizing your zoning authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| It's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| that Chattanooga's equivalency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| of our MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| did such a study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| certainly attempted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| such a study is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Whether it is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| adequate study or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| I don't know the answer to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| question because it hasn't been tested in the courts yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Well, of course, Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| isn't here tonight, but we had a brief discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| that the MTAS legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| team had felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| that they had done a very good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| sufficient job, and felt like that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| standing or whatever you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| call it, that it was a good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| that they were on firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| solid legal ground, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| can confirm that once Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| gets back. Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| has never felt that they weren't on good, solid legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| ground until some judge told them they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| question becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| do we have enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| information here to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| that there is a basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| upon which you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| utilize the zoning power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| that has been delegated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| control these businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Can you show, yeah, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| show that there are adverse impacts from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| these businesses. Clearly, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| no fan of these businesses, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| don't want to pretend to be a fan of these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| They engage in predatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| lending practices. They engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| in usury, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| They are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| good businesses to have around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| and clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| the state legislature, if they would get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| their hands dirty and get in there and legislate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| and deal with these businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| clearly has the authority to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| these businesses, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| the state very clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| has the authority to delegate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| specifically to you the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| authority to regulate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| businesses. Thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| the state has not been willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| do that. The state has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| neither engaged in specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| regulation of these businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| nor has the state granted to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| some statute that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| corporations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| have the legal authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| to regulate these through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| distance requirements. They could say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| They can pass a statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| next time they're in session that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| you have the specific authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| to regulate in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| and we find that these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| businesses that deserve to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| be regulated. If they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| confer upon you very specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| that authority, I wouldn't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| question at all that you would have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| They have not done so to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| I know that these ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| have been passed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| other municipalities in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| the state of Tennessee. I know they've been passed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Chattanooga, in Nashville, in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| All have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| similar type of distance requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| ordinances like these. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| what I said to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| legal staff was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| find me a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Find me a case out there where one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| these ordinances has been tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| It would be really helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| if you could find me a case in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| where one of these distance type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| requirement ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| got passed, got challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| in the courts, and some appellate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| court either says they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| or they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| They have the authority to do it or they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| have the authority to do it. But if you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| find that case in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| find some other state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| has a similar sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| governmental structure and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| see if you can find a case in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| other state that has addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| And I know Krista worked hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| at it. I know our law clerks worked hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| at it. We had several lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| I didn't try because they're better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| at legal research than I am to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| the truth because they're really good with those computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| and that's the way you do legal research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| these days. But they tried really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| to find cases that would say either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| yes, you can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Some court has tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| this type of statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| or ordinance and has found it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| acceptable. Or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| some court has tested this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| and says no, you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| really do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| I don't think that case exists because these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| really good lawyers and they would have found that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| if that case existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| So I don't think that case is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| leaves me in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| try to give you some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| advice about what the law is in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| without having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| real solid underpinning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| whether this type of ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| would be upheld or would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| And the concern that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| and I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| the concern that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| is that in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| this is not like, you know, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| tort area where we get in a car wreck or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| like that. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| got caps on our damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| We've got a $300,000 cap right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| on damages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| harm somebody by virtue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| of some tortious activity that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| engage in. Those caps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| don't apply when you're talking about a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| of constitutional rights. And what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| talking about here is the right to conduct business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| so the measure of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| damages is a little different. The measure of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| damages for somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| who wanted to challenge this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| or some group of somebodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| who wanted to challenge this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| and say we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| lost the opportunity to conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| this business. We were prepared to conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| this business. We were, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| the property. We wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| run this business. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| here's what, here are the profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| that we lost by virtue of the fact that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| weren't permitted to do that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| that is a violation of our constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| rights, this loss of business opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| type thing. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| can be really big numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| They can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| scary numbers. And I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| offer for, as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| for that, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| offer to you a case that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| the city of Knoxville had some years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| It wasn't this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| because we hadn't done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| And it wasn't exactly like this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| But it was a case where through our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| power, we had tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| regulate those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| that rent the dirty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| videos. I forgot what the real name for those is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| There's probably some legitimate name for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| But you know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| The businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| we said that you could only have a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| percentage of your video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| stock could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| XXX rated videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| that's what our ordinance said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| It's like ivory silk. You had to be 99%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| pure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| And this is the fantasy video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| versus city of Knoxville case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Adult bookstores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| No, not adult bookstores. It's not adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| businesses. This is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| video stores that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| tried to regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| ultimately the court said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| that our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| was vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| And we had denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| these people this business opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| So by an invalid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| operation, by an invalid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| use of our zoning power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| we had harmed these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And so then they let them put on their proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| as to what their lost profits were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| And there was a verdict against the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| of $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Those are the kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| of damages that get my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| They get my attention in a big hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| And what I'm suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| to you is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| part of my job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| help you evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| the exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| that you have to potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| liability and not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| evaluate the exposure to liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| evaluate the limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| of that liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| the answer to the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| can you legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| enact this ordinance and can you be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| confident that it will be upheld by the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| is I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| I hope that you would have the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| But truthfully, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| I don't have the case that says so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| And I would rather Chattanooga find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| for us. I would rather Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| find out for us because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| if the answer is no, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| that great big judgment to be against Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| or Memphis instead of against the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Knoxville. So my suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| and you know, you're the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| legislative body. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| are in charge of deciding what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| legislation you're going to pass and what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| not going to pass. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| think that the exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| to liability in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| And not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| is the exposure to liability significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| the types of damages that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| could arise out of that liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| are truly significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| And so my advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| whether you take my advice or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| my advice to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| council would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| table this measure until we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| get a case somewhere. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| even say it has to be from the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| Tennessee. Just somewhere, give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| a case where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| something similar to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| under the same scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| that either supports or says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| no. If there's a case that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| yes, then let's bring it back and we'll take a run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| at it. And we'll rely on that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| as our legal basis for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| at the same time, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| watch while the feds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| enact these measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| that they are proposing to enact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| and see whether that has a beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| And at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| we can go to our legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| our state legislators, and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| to those state legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| would you please do one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Would you either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| adopt some legislation to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| this problem that you clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| have the power to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| or if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| unwilling to do that, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| give us the power to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| taking away our power all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| How about specifically designating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| some authority to us to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| with this problem? Because it's a problem in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| community, so give us the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| authority, the specific authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| to deal with it. If they'll give us that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| take it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| the table and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Let's see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| But from my perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| as the city attorney, I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| until that happens, I just can't recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| to do it. Does that mean you or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| administration is going to our legislator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| So Charles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| walk me through, we by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| ordinance regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| if you're within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| 300 foot of a daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| a hospital, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Yeah. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| it's the same, to me it's the same scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Oh no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Well okay, if you'll let me finish, I'll listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Alright. I just want to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| question out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| to me, I mean it's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| we've done harm to them, they haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| been able to sell, get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| beer permit, so I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| in my simple mind, to me it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| the same thing, but you've got a good answer as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| why I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| And I welcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| that 300 distance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| there to prohibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| somebody who's within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| 300 distance of, 300 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| distance of being exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| to selling of alcohol, which at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| folks felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| was a harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| to expose children, or people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| going to funerals, or people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| going to hospitals, or whatever it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| that there was a specific harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| within that particular situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| that being exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| within that distance would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| would create a problem, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| enacted to address that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| You can agree or disagree whether it actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| does that, but that clearly is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| it was for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| A better analogy here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| is to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| fast food restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| serve terrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| nutritional food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| and so what we really need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| is regulate fast food restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| by saying you can only have one fast food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| restaurant every thousand feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| That's because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| there's no real specific harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| within that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| area. There's no adverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| arising out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| that business being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| operated in that particular place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| It's just that that business is being operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| at all, that's the problem, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| you're trying to do is limit the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| those businesses that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| Okay, but to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| I mean, there was a council whenever this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| was enacted that thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| that that would be a bad idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| that somebody drinking alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| could crash their car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| you know, was there case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| studies, was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| I mean, to me it's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| thought process. Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| council in their wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| thought that it would be a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Yeah, that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| a city and a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| bunch of cities all across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| exercising their police power. They weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| using the zoning power to do that, they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| exercising their police power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| to enact those particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| kind of distance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| But I can also show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| or 200 appellate cases that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| uphold that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| I can't show you those cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| with regard to this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| And so what would those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| judgments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| what would they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| how did they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| uphold it? I mean, what was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| basis, what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| and they say, yeah, by God, you all were right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| to do that. They say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| you are entitled to use your police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| power to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| somebody from being exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| to selling alcohol within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| particular distance. That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| they have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Are you saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| in the alcohol example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| there are innocent people that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| be hurt by the activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| and the only people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| hurt in the loan situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| is the poor guy getting the loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| and then getting seven other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| loans to pay off the loan and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| 67% interest he pays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| and it's harm to an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| not to the physical area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| That's part of what I'm saying, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| there's no adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| to the area in which that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| particular business is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| My earlier question was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| is the administration going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| our lobbyist or the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| or the Knoxville delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| to either A, give authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| either take action as a state if they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| the nerve to do that, or B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| affirmatively tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| localities to go ahead and do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Yes, we are going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| We have not already done it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| we have discussed that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| part of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| we want to propose to our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| when we get the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| to propose something to them for the next session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Yes. And the fact that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| a charter community as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| to a pure state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| legislation community, does that make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| a difference? In other words, do we write our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| ticket as a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| type community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| In some ways, yes, but we still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| to use only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| the authority that's been delegated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| us by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| But as a charter...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| We're still a subset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you, Mayor. This is certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| a tough recommendation to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| I thought we should have voted on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| a couple meetings ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| But I guess my question is, have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| talked to or had any conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| or plan to have any conversations with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| departments in Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| and Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| and Nashville and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| their... Did they wrestle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| it all and what was their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| take on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| I have talked to the law departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| in at least two other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| locations about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| What they have suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| to me is that a political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| decision rather than a legal decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| They're going to do their best to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| defend it. When those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| six bodies passed, was it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| discussed, the same type of issues we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| been discussing here for the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| 15 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| A lot of city attorneys aren't as blunt as I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| the bluntness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| I'd just like to respond to Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| I know Rob has had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| numerous conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| too, so you might check in with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| on his findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| I guess the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| that comes back to me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| do we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| affirmative harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| to residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3867)|

| 1:04:31| if these things cluster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Not if they do business or how they do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| but if they cluster together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| in one area so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| they end up blighting the surrounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| I don't know if, A, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| be enough to satisfy Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| and, B, whether you'd have to do a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| and send Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| out to pound the sticks to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| But that's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| concerns that got us here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| was if you put five or six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| of them within a quarter of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| do you end up having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| a sort of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| entering blighted zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| This is where the poor people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| go down, you know? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| And you don't want to open your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| she-she, whatever, clothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| store, food store, something there, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| you're now in a depressed area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| that scares away clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| And I don't know if that's enough. I'm just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| that's how we got here, was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| clustering was the evil, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| how they do business. I mean, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| for someone else to regulate. We're too small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| a fry to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| That's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| I don't know if Mr. Green has anything to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| tell us about that, but, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| you see residential values being affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| you see businesses refusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| to locate, other kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| of businesses refusing to locate there because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| the signs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| you're in a whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| you know, the hood, the bad hood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Well, we have not done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| a study like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| It would be somewhat difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| And I'm going, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| want to limb here and say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| I think it's a personal perception thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| and I will state that last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| year when my wife and I were looking for a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| to buy in Knoxville and moved here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| that when she saw clustering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| of these types of businesses, we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| not look for homes in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| And that's a personal, perceptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| choice. I think it would be difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| to place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| it would be a difficult study to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| do and would take some time. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| It would probably be an MIA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| appraiser or some MAI appraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| that would have to do that and show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| that clustering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| damages property values. And it would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| to be over a long-term look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| values before those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| were located there, the rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| of increase compared to rate of increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| in other neighborhoods, look at other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| factors that would weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| on the increase in value in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| neighborhoods, so it would be a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| complex study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| That's the type of study that I was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| in terms of, you know, a similar thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| that we do for the adult entertainment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| industry, you know, in order to justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| being able to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| them with the zoning power. We do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| some kind of affirmative harm you find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Nick. Okay, well, I mean, to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| dovetail off what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Councilman DellaVolpe was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| I mean, that's what started all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| I mean, blame me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| I'm the one that brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| but I brought it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| because my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| were fed up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Absolutely fed up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| And if you go up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| I mean, it's just one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| after the other after the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| And I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| the response the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| law department has given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| I wasn't aware of the cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| on the 300 and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| there is no cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| I'm still a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| fuzzy about the 300 foot thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| and prohibiting somebody from getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| a beer license, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| you know. But at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| there is exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| But there's also exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| if we don't do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| about it. Because of all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| strides that I feel like we've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| in South Knoxville, and they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| small baby steps, but they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| turning into bigger steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| And it's the same way we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| get that same enthusiasm out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| of North Knoxville into East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| And it sends a terrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| message. So I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| everything that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| for the most part, is policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| We have exposure when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| we have an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| on a zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| or when we rezone property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| or when we deny a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| We have exposure as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| and we have financial exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| But we also have exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| to the very fabric of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| our community, which is neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| And the investment up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| our major corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| And this, to me, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| just what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Mr. Swanson says. You've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| to weigh it out. Is it worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| the exposure? There has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| been a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| There could be one tomorrow. And it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| a huge one. But what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| do know is that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| harming my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| and I feel like it harms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| equally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| not all the districts, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| some other of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| And I'm not going to speak for my fellow council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| But I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| think that that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| decision that we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| to make. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| need to do it. I mean, this should have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| really addressed well before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| now. Because every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| and you go up and down, I know, I think there's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| It seems like there's two that's opened recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| on Chapman Highway. So every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| day that this goes by, and I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| MPC had to do their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| study, and then there was leadership change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| and all that. So I get all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| But still, every day that goes by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| and if we allow it to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| to happen, I think it harms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| our community. Can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| put a monetary value to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| No, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Would there be a judgment in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| $1.5 million? Would there be a judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| of $10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| I don't know that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| I wouldn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| brought it forward if I wasn't going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| So, I mean, that's just, from my heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| why I feel like that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| the right way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| And I'm like Mr. Swanson, I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| don't know if it's the right way to go, but I'm willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| to take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| If this were to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| then the ones that are already existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| would be grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| That's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Thank you, Mr. Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| you all are right. We got here because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| the perceived harm that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| may be caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| by the clustering or whatever of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Seems to me there's another issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| that, at least in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| some sections of town, and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Chapman is one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| and that is the ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| of the property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| their actions or lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| of actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| which may go hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| in glove with this. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| But that kind of appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| that way to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| I have no data to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| Perhaps MPC would have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| But it seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| that is, or at least in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| a related issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| I don't know what to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| about that, but here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| I just wanted to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| to Mr. Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| And I intended to say this right at the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| I congratulate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| Mr. Pavlis, and I congratulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Council for bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| this to the Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| because I think it is a genuine problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| the kind of problem that you ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| dealing with. And frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| I wish I could give you more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| definitive legal advice than I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| been able to give you over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| I really wish I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| But you are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| what you are charged with the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| for doing. You are considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| these important issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| and they are important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| And you do perceive harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| resulting from what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| on with these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| All I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| with regard to that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| it's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| more complex legally than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| and I would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| buttressing before I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| to get into court on something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| And that's all I'm saying. I'm not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| you're doing the wrong thing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| And if I was a Council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| I would love to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| I just wanted you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Yes, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| I would like to say I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| as a legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| certainly we're responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| to listen to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| neighborhood groups and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| But I think we're definitely on the right track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| by having MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| look at it, and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| we appreciate the wise counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| of Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| But certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| we have to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| And this is a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| in certain parts of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| more so than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| But really it's kind of spreading all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| But I think this is a much needed workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| And I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| Mr. Swanson's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| as well as MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| so that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| make a wise decision on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| because it's something going to affect our future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| Don't we have a guest speaker or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Any other questions or comments from Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| before we go into public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| Do you folks have anything else to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| to the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| We do have one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| Mr. Jim Brady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Yes, my name is Jim Brady. I live on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| 208 Linford Road. I live in Mr. Pavlis'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| And I'd like to echo that. Mr. Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| actually carries our conscience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| not just our vote in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| And this has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| an issue that we've talked about as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| I always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| levity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| that a seasoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| counselor will bring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| So I appreciate Mr. Swanson's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| But I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| our exposure to liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| in this situation falls short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| in comparison to the greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| weight of the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| If that wasn't the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| our federal and our state legislatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| would not be having their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| support committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| in discovery right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| just like our MPC is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| So this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| warranted issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| You know, you always have to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| and I think in terms of mathematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| least common denominator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| What are the references that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| are all bringing up? The porn industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| the alcohol, all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| types of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| You know, when you look at these situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| you know, many years ago, if you went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| into a certain new town or someplace that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| weren't familiar with and you saw stores that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| selling pagers, you saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| three, four, five of these stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| you knew you were kind of in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| part of town you didn't necessarily want to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| is the modern-day pager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| example. I bought a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| on Linford Road prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| to the mass explosion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| these. I would have actually given some serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| consideration to other parts within our municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| I moved here for work almost five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| years ago, and I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| like being a part of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Thank you, Nick. This is the first time anybody's ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| said to me they haven't been able to hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| I was bothered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| quite significantly by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| some of the comments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Governor-at-Large Wallace had back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| January, February about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Just kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| laissez-faire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| commentary of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| that it just seemed like it was a degradation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| of the neighborhoods by selective perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| I think this would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| much different conversation for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| if there were eight of these on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| corner of Kingston Pike and Cedar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Bluff, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| popping up in large droves in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| Farragut. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| from the evidence that was presented, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| believe this is just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| lower-income issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| because this does bleed over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| I do think that it is worthwhile for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| look at the situation. When I first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| spoke to Nick about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| this, I sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| staff about 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| pages of documents about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| different legislations from municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| We're not the first municipality, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| strongly recommend that you not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| feel as though we need to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| We can follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| the leadership of other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| similar to our size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| and what we strive to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| this is a situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| caution outweighs the weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| because honestly, action is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| or inaction, is not a solution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| There has to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| form of action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| There has to be a statement made for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| that you are that line of defense here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| Function above form at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| point is the important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| To address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| what Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| was referring to, we have a strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| community in my area, and we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| strong online presence as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| There is an online presence called Next Door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Just in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| Colonial Village area, we have 139| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| participants. That's a small community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| What do we do as a community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| We have four vacant buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| right now on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| If I call one of the owners of the listing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| or the listing agent for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| and just say, hey, I have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Would you please be cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| about who you rent to? We'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| this. That doesn't have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| When I post that to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| and 12 or 15 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| 20 of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| do exactly the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| that owner or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| that leasing agent says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| okay, I get this. This makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Just like what I'm saying with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Pavlis. Mr. Pavlis is a part of our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| there. We sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| down as a group and we talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| I mean that seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| He carries our conscience on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| I would encourage you to go back to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| districts and talk to your people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| about it because I think you're going to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| the same thing, but definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| right now, inaction is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| There definitely has to be some form of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| action on it and with all due respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| to Mr. Swanson, who I very much enjoyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| the presentation he had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I do believe the greater weight of the evidence outweighs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| the liability potentials here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| There's no one else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| signed up, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| are adjourned. Thank you, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877160629?start=4763)|
