| 0:03:29| How did you come up with that name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=209)|

| 0:03:43| houses that worked at the Cherokee Country Club and the Brickyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=223)|

| 0:03:50| And when do you think you'll have all this done and be open for business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=230)|

| 0:17:58| and it puts you folks to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| And so what really are our options here, Councilor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| Well, options, as I see it, is there's a postponement until a date certain, whether it's May meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1084)|
| 0:18:15| or June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| There's also an option to table the matter, which is a postponement to an uncertain date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| to allow these people to complete their paperwork, have their inspections done, take task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1105)|
| 0:18:34| and everything and background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Then once they're done, it can be put back on the beer board agenda or the due is provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1116)|
| 0:18:45| in the city ordinance and you can deny the permit and then they could come back and apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| as early as tomorrow if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| But they'd have to formally start the whole process again and pay the $250 application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1132)|
| 0:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| I'm inclined to think that after having this delayed six times and with the amount of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| that's needed and the amount of work and effort that's gone into it, what I would propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| is that we deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| They have the ability to come back tomorrow and apply again to get on to the May or June agenda, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| They're not required to come back tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| I'm just saying, for example, they could apply first thing tomorrow morning if they desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Because I just think that there's a limit to how long we're going to postpone these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| And I think that in my opinion, we've been over backwards, I mean, six times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| And then to come up at the sixth time and still have all this information that's needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| you know, I'd like to make a motion that we deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Before we vote on that, Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| Yeah, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| If we table it, Mr. Frost, then they would have to get it back on the agenda themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| but the application would still be alive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| It would still be alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| If they would have time to go get their approvals taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| and then they would notify Ms. Day or Chairman Palmer that they're ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| then a member of Council would put them back on, would untable it to put them back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Sergeant Hunter, is there any disadvantage to you in that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| other than the background check getting dated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| In other words, would it have to be updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| They'd just have to come in and do the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| I guess I don't think we've ever set forth a minimum time period for a background check to be updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| so it would depend on how long it was tabled for, I guess, whether it was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| But they haven't submitted their prints, right, so they would do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Oh, no, that's the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Well, the paperwork I have said they have not been in for prints or background check yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| so if that still holds true, there's nothing to update yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| So they would simply do that as part of the other chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| They can just make an appointment and do the fingerprints and background check separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| The task is good until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| I'd like to make that a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Do you want to speak first, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| Well, I think you made a motion and I seconded it, actually, so that's the motion that's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| I'd like to ask Mrs. Anderson, what do you all think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Is 30 days adequate or should we vote to extend it for 60 days or 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| What do you all want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Our biggest issue is we went into the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| and we were informed when the fire marshal came out to talk to us in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| that we had to put sprinkler systems in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| We've been trying to work with our landlord on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| It's not going too well in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| so we've been trying to come up with putting those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| or we're trying to meet again with the fire marshal this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| and determine can we open without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| If we can open without having to do the sprinkler systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| it's all doable within the next month for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| You're going in the old Sunny's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| The old Sunny's building, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Right, that's where you're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| I guess the reason we haven't finished everything else that's on the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| is knowing that until we figure out the building status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| as far as if we have to put the sprinklers in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| we just haven't made that move forward to finish up the rest of what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| That's the final piece you all need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| If you have to, you're trying to decide whether that's a go or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| but you'll know that before the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Will you have a motion and a second on the floor to postpone it for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| and give him time to get that settled, and then they'll go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Do we have a second for his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Yes, we can withdraw your motion if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Vice Mayor Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Again, what I'm saying is that it seems to me that we on the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| have a responsibility to let people know that we don't just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| if I come in tomorrow and take on an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| but may not decide to have my place for nine months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| and keep coming back and repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| And, I mean, this is serious to get your application done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| And so I feel that, you know, going six times is going over the limit in terms of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| But I do agree there is a motion on the table, but I'm not in favor of approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| Well, at the time when we talked about that, it was because one of the reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| and I don't disagree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| one of the concerns was they had taken the background and the fingerprints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| in this case, six months ago, you know, and that they would have to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| And that was one of the reasons we talked about, you know, putting a time set on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| But I've just been keeping up with it in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| And, I mean, you know, I think it's probably a pretty unusual case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| And I think it's probably got reason to postpone it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| So the motion on the floor at the moment is to defer this to the May 24th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| at which time everything will be done, including the sprinklers or whatever we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| and you will not be asking for another deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| I pray that's, I mean, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| That's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Because I'm thinking that this beer board has a lot of patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| But we're about to the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Well, let me just throw this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| I mean, you know, I still am not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| I'm still a little concerned that she's going to be ready for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| And it may be more appropriate to table it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| and let them get all their ducks in a row and come to us and say we've got all the checklists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| But then again, it's a parliamentary issue because it's in the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| and I don't want to particularly get in front of the second district representative to put that back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| And it would take somebody from this board to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| And then it takes away the continual merry-go-round, if you will, of the paperwork that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| But it also keeps them from having to spend $250 more, which is not an inordinate amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| But, you know, business is getting going, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| it's just like every time you move or something there's a lot of expense incurred when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| So, you know, I'm waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| I would agree to table if they take the motion off the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| If I could make a motion to postpone and I will move to table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Or withdraw the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| So we now have a motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I make the motion that we table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Let me ask one clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Do we have to have a beer board meeting to put it back on the table and wait for the publication so it actually is a two-step dance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1555)|
| 0:26:04| Is that what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Well, after they have notified either Ms. Day or the chair that they're ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| the process is that it's on the agenda to notify the public that it's being taken off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1571)|
| 0:26:19| It passes that, then it's heard at the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| It's a two-step dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| One, to get it off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| The second one, to approve it or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| We have a motion and a second to table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Well, my bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| I just want one more point of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| So we would have to take it off the table at next May's beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| Then it wouldn't be heard until June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| It's a notice procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| What's the requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Well, it's put on the agenda for notice purposes that it's being untabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1617)|
| 0:27:05| It would be untabled at that meeting, and I believe the rules would require for it to be put on the next agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| to be heard on the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| You'd have to publicize the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| Ms. Anderson, do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Basically, it would be postponing it for 60 days and not 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| That would be the earliest it could be heard would be 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Versus if you were to postpone it, you'd have to have what they're saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| do you think it's really likely that you can have everything done by 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| The sprinklers and all that, is that likely or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| They're saying they don't want to postpone it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Now, if that is in the process and they're a week away from being finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| and everything else has been completed next month in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| because I think right now what we're really hoping for is to get through Memorial Day weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| open the first part of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| So I don't know if everything, you know, I hate to say that I don't know what the sprinkler company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| because they're saying it could take them four to five weeks to order the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| and get it installed if we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Pending final documentation at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| At that, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Well, you know, I started this mess, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| No, there were others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| I mean, I was just trying to find fair and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| I'm glad you brought up the two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| I didn't know, but I thought I'd ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| You've got to publish in a newspaper, I guess, to let the world know what's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| Could we have a special meeting to put this, to untable this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| that would get it published and get it back on the May or June agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Let's say maybe six weeks out, have a special called meeting at 650 just for that, and if they're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1746)|
| 0:29:17| I think it's just easier to postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| And if they're not ready, then, you know, at least they'll know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| So it sounds like there's still quite a bit of indecision to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Well, and didn't you say, Ms. Anderson, that it could be five weeks to get the sprinklers installed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| Assuming that we have to actually put them in, our last two fire people that came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1773)|
| 0:29:40| were really surprised that we were going to be required to put them in if we're not changing occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| And so my husband's trying to meet with the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| If we have to put them in, they said it would take two weeks to get the materials in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| and then two to three weeks for the installation, for KUB to come out and do what they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| So that, I mean, it would be in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| We would know when we would be finished with it at that point in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| We currently have a motion on the floor to table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Mr. Pavlis, would you like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Yeah, I still, I mean, I just don't think you're going to come to us in May and be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| And I would be supportive at that time of Vice Mayor Grieve's motion to just deny and make you start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1823)|
| 0:30:32| Because, I mean, that would have been seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| And that's just, I don't know of one that we've had that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| So the dilemma you're in is if we postpone it, and I'm fine to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| but if you come back the next time, I won't be fine to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| Or if we deny it tonight, it costs you $250, and you get it done and come back when you're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| You know, you're kind of caught in the middle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| We're trying to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| And my husband got stuck, so here I am too, and this is all kind of new to me going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| We're trying to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Oh, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Believe me, I wish we had opened six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| I think the tabling is more prudent, and we can have a special meeting if we have to, to help speed up the final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1877)|
| 0:31:26| But we'll have it on the table or not table for May 24th, I guess, or at least resurrection or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| No, if it's tabled, it won't necessarily come out on May the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| Yeah, unless she calls and says we're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| Unless she calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Unless those sprinklers appear magically, they work, everything else is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| I still think that's safer than addressing the question that Mr. Grieve has, which is too many times coming here, postpone again, postpone again, postpone again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1904)|
| 0:31:53| I think you're going to be put in a terrible position on May 24th to say deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| So why not table it and save the grief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Not grief, but grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Vice Mayor Grieve, this is your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Is this the first time you all have been through this as far as getting a beer permit or having a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| I mean, my husband's been through it in other restaurants since he's been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| I mean, when Mulligan's first opened, it wasn't ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| But, you know, we've relocated, and we actually had no idea it was going to be the process we've been going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1942)|
| 0:32:31| I said, he's always done the business side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| I've always been the person that deals with the people inside the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| So, you know, I've not been through this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| I just think with the indecisions that are out there and the things that need, the best thing to do is to table it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| That's my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| My mind's twirling here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Let me ask this, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| So if we tabled it and then it has to come back to an official, you know, beer board meeting to take it off notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1978)|
| 0:33:09| could we have a second beer board meeting directly after the first beer board meeting and approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1989)|
| 0:33:19| I'm trying you, aren't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Well, actually, Ms. Day and I earlier talked today about what Mr. Swanson had done with advertising things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| He was of the opinion once you advertise it the first time, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| You don't necessarily have to keep re-advertising it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| But we talked about the logistics that Ms. Day was going to have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| So that, you know, it's been advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| So that might be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Now, answering the question you didn't ask, what might be possibly easier for this lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| now it's not my money I'm talking about spending, if they withdraw or it gets denied tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2031)|
| 0:34:00| I mean if they get everything going like they want, then they can reapply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| and then it might be able to happen quicker or you all could table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| Or postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Councilman Dillon, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| That's an old way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| I will ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Are you allowed to have a double notice for the same night that we will consider untabling and acting on the merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| or is that not permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| In other words, you would tell the public we already have two issues, like Nick was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| that we're addressing, one, to table or untable and then two, if untabled, then to address the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| That's messy, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| It's messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| I think, you know, since it has been noticed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| probably to be heard that I, you know, like going on what my predecessor did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| it probably would be sufficient that we go ahead and notice it for being untabled and hear it later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2097)|
| 0:35:06| This is a very atypical situation, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| So everybody up here is trying to figure out a way to move you on down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| and avoid conversations like this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Vice Mayor Grieve, and then I'm going to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| You know, I would feel a lot better, and we're not trying to stop people from having a business or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| but, you know, again, we're looking at six times that we've done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| and there's no prints, no background check, and then this whole list of things over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| I would feel a lot more comfortable if they came and said, hey, we've got all the paperwork done at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| but we lack, you know, the construction or the sprinklers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| But to, you know, it's almost as though we're rewarding bad behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| that this has now gone on six different times, and I just don't think that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| I've called the question, and the motion on the floor is to table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2164)|

| 0:36:42| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| We need the building inspection approval, the fire prevention approval, and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| So moved, pending final document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2211)|

| 0:36:55| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Is there a measurement issue you were going to bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| I believe you've applied for a TABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| That is correct, and it's in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| We are awaiting approval, hoping to hear something back this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| And so that nullifies the distance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| I understand that someone told you that because that church is in a strip mall that it would not affect you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| and that person gave you incorrect information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Because there was another business in that strip mall that was denied because of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2243)|

| 0:41:54| It's actually Glassford for a Purpose LLC doing business as unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Glassford is a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2520)|

| 0:42:04| It holds behind my daughter who was on the bus accident in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| So, unique, that's where the name came from, but it's something that I wanted to open up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2530)|
| 0:42:17| and do something different for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2539)|

| 0:43:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Next on the agenda is the resolution of the Beer Board pursuant to Chapter 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| Basically, this is a housekeeping motion to be sure that our application permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| is aligned with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2594)|

| 0:43:29| Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Do I hear a motion to defer this to the May 24th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2610)|

| 0:43:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2624)|

| 0:43:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Until May 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Now, we also have an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| And it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Do we have fuel stop number three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Do we have fuel stop number three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| That was our address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Next, we have the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Well, it was Cholo Taqueria and now it's Chivo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| Do we have someone here from that organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| Tell us where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2647)|

| 0:44:16| Oh, I wish I could say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| We are looking to get an extension for another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| We've gotten our electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and building inspections completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| Still waiting on the fire and health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| So, by May 24th, you expect to be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Move to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| We'll see you again on May the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Schulz Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Schulz Bra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Schulz Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| They are looking at the on and off premise permit that's still pending for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| They have a number of inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Do I hear a motion to defer this to May 24th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| And this particular one did get the manufacturing part open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| It's the other part that's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| It's the local service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| We have two administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| The first is Surinam of Thailand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you for your patience, Mr. Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Greg Harrison here for the establishment, 800 South Gay Street, Suite 1650, Knoxville, 37929.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2727)|
| 0:45:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| This is to see if we want to do an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| These people have been cited twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| They've been to TABC with a fine and a 10-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| They've paid a $500 fine to us and received – we got a very good remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| So I would like to recommend that we take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Do not send them to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| But if they ever come back before us again, they'll bypass us and go right to the admin hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Next up is Brooke View Center Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I'm Tasha Blakeney, 400 West Church Avenue, Suite 101 here in Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| I'm the attorney counsel for the Courtyard Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| I also have with me present Vincent Andreula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| He's the general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| And also Caleb McKay, who is the guest care manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| This also is an organization that has been cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| They've had a TABC suspension and a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| They've paid a $500 fine to us, and they've had a remedial plan that has improved as they've submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Is that the one-page statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| I think that was an old plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| They've got a better plan that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| There was a full plan that was submitted to the TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| The first issue was with regard to the TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| The second was a bureau-related issue, so there was not a subsequent remedial plan that was required at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| But there has been one submitted to TABC that is fairly extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| I see the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| I would like to recommend that we not send this to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| However, this has been twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| A third time is an administrative hearing without our involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160426?start=2849)|
