| 2:00:42| devastation, find a way to pull your children out of Knox County schools because this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| board at present is harming your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7253)|
| 2:01:00| And Lance McCold will be after Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| Tanya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7265)|
| 2:01:15| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| So as you were talking about the Ezra monies today, I know it seems unrealistic to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7276)|
| 2:01:25| this, but the Ezra money I know that you received is over $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| We wish that we had gotten the $224 million that Memphis Shelby County got, or that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7291)|
| 2:01:38| Davidson County got $124 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| But knowing that our problems with Knox County schools has been exacerbated by this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7303)|
| 2:01:51| We have over a handful of schools that are well over 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| And I know it's one time money, but as you listened to the superintendent earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7316)|
| 2:02:03| there are challenges that educators have actually took on this year to make sure that your school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7323)|
| 2:02:10| system is run in a decent and orderly manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| And those funds that he has carved out has, I just got my phone blew up of saying how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7334)|
| 2:02:24| thankful they are for your consideration of passing this next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7344)|
| 2:02:30| So I will talk about that more next week as if you pass it or if you don't pass it, it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| pin all the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| But just knowing that we need more than the $50 million that were sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7358)|
| 2:02:45| We have buildings that do not have, and Russ Oaks can actually talk about this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| But we don't, we have buildings that air conditioning systems are just as old as those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| buildings and the $50 million can actually go into one or two of our schools and we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| have enough for the other, the 84 buildings that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| We just know that any little piece of money that knowing that our teachers need it, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| students need it, and more so to help you in the district, there are a lot of challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7391)|
| 2:03:18| besides just masks right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| We have, we haven't had textbooks for over 20 years that are up to date and it's because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7400)|
| 2:03:27| of the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| We know that the district has done everything, they have given more than their fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7408)|
| 2:03:34| And now it's our time for not only our legislators on our state level to give us the money that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| we deserve, because saying that we're fully funded in the state of Tennessee is just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| If we have over 500 or some teachers in our districts that we have to actually pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| out of our pockets, and that we need these people to actually do what, we have parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| that want to have foreign languages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| I don't want to talk about all the foreign languages that we have, but we try to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7440)|
| 2:04:06| that we address all parents' needs, all students' needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| But now it's time that we start addressing all educators' needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| We have a shortage in SPED where we can't even, we have to actually pay for, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| know if you do this or not, maybe you do, but we had, just up to two years ago, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7461)|
| 2:04:27| to pay for RTI out of our own pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| So when they say that they're fully funding public education in Knox County, Davidson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7470)|
| 2:04:36| County, or Shelby County, it's a hoax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| They're giving us the money that they think that we need, but we need a whole lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| So the $50 million, we're not saying that we won't take it, I know Mr. Thomas would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| probably run me down the street saying that I'm not giving $50 million back, but just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7487)|
| 2:04:53| knowing that you need more money to help run your schools, and we can't say thank you enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| for what we know is to come, and knowing that your job is never done, and we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| Thank you very much, Lance McColl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7506)|
| 2:05:19| And please just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| Lance McColl, Knox County, thank you for having me, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7522)|
| 2:05:30| I didn't have the benefit of seeing the plan that Mr. McPherson presented to you, so my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7530)|
| 2:05:37| remarks about how to use the S02 money is blind, but the things I'm hearing from teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7537)|
| 2:05:48| is they are worn out, and the people, they're being overworked, and I'm sure they appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7548)|
| 2:05:57| I'm sure they're thrilled to hear that they're going to get a little extra compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7557)|
| 2:06:03| not all that they deserve by a long ways, but they need to have some things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7563)|
| 2:06:09| tangibly reducing their workload, and we have, the story we've always had is we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7569)|
| 2:06:18| the money, we don't have the money, we don't have the money, it's not true anymore, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| got $50 million, and if the Democrats have their way, there will be many millions more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| on the way, so I would urge you to raise the wages for custodians until you get every custodian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7590)|
| 2:06:38| filled, positions filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| I would urge you to hire people to get the kids off the bus, put the kids on the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| to manage the lunchtime, take it off the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| I would urge you to hire extra mental health workers, social workers, counselors, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7610)|
| 2:06:56| the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| Do what you need to take care of your staff, the children and the staff, people tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7618)|
| 2:07:04| over and over again how important mental health problems are, but we have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7624)|
| 2:07:11| I mean, spending it on all the things that Mr. McPherson mentioned are perfectly fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| but you've got to take care of the people first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| When you've done taking care of the people, then you can take care of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| So what I urge you to do is to focus on people things when you spend this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7643)|
| 2:07:32| They're all related to the COVID pandemic, there are lots of things that are justified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7652)|
| 2:07:40| the custodians, there's no reason, well, there's a good reason we haven't had enough custodians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| is because we don't pay them enough and we can't keep them, but there's no reason we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| can't pay them enough to keep them, to get them in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| You know, there's no reason we haven't had enough social workers and counselors for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| schools and mental health workers for our teachers because we haven't had the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7677)|
| 2:08:02| So we have money, you know, let's spend it where the people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7689)|

| 2:08:51| to the change center this past Friday with WJBE hosting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| It was an opportunity for them to kind of voice, to lift up their own voice concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7736)|
| 2:09:01| violence in their community and things that they want to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| And I really appreciate Andre's comments about the way we frame this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| And so I'd ask that we send out a link to that to all the board and would encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| you to take a look at that and then also appreciate board member Satterfield for helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7753)|
| 2:09:19| host that and allow for a platform for students to lift up their voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7759)|
| 2:09:25| Daniel, can you send the link to us through Terry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=7765)|
