| 0:05:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Thank you. Is there a motion to approve our minutes of the June 30th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| I have an initial inquiry, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Do we have nine members or eight members? How many members are here when one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| votes yo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| All right. I'm sorry. It was a motion to approve minutes of June 30th. I think I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=340)|
| 0:05:48| over here yo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Yo. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| And a second to that, anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Thank you. Any corrections, additions? All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Opposed, no. Okay. Items dealing with the agenda. Items to be withdrawn. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Pablis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| I'd like to call on Southeastern Housing. I think that he may have some business before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you, Councilman Pablis. David Arning with Southeastern Housing Foundation, 901| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| East Summit Hill Drive. As I think Council is aware, we had submitted to BZA a parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| variance request that was approved to reduce our parking. Subsequent to that, we met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| the neighborhood and with some members of council. And after some discussion, we determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| that it was in the best interest of the project and the neighborhood if we developed the 58| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| parking spaces that are required by code. So that variance, that parking variance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| no longer necessary for us. And so we would like to withdraw that. We inquired with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| as to the administrative process for doing that. And I'm not sure there is a clear process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| for that. But in any event, we would like to withdraw that application and plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| build the 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Okay. And with that being a public statement, then I'll go ahead and make a motion for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| this council to approve the withdrawal and look for a second and perhaps Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| Let me clarify the motion, if you don't mind, Councilman Pablis. I think the motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| you wish to make is a motion to withdraw the application for variance. What we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=448)|
| 0:07:36| before us is an appeal. And because our code provides for appeal de novo, that means it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| a new hearing altogether. And because it's a new hearing altogether, you as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| can do whatever the lower board, which in this case is the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| could have done at that time. Had the southeast housing appeared before the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| Appeals and asked to withdraw their application for a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| could have at that time permitted by motion the withdrawal of that application. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| they had the authority to do that on an appeal de novo, you have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| And so the motion that you're actually making is a motion to allow southeast housing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| withdraw the application for a variance. And the resulting, if that motion is seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=502)|
| 0:08:30| and then adopted by five or more members of council, the impact of that will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| will be no variance. No variance will exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| So that's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| That's what I meant to say. I meant to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Is there a second to that first? Okay, thank you. Further, actually, Mr. DelVolping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| Mr. Arning, while you're there, do you concur that, in effect, that you'll be seeking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| put in 48 parking spaces, not the 24 you asked for before the BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| It's 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| But you're going to put in a larger number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| All right. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| If I may, I would like to make one point. We have last week submitted a new application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| to MPC for a new use on review. After inquiring with MPC staff about the change to the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| design and also the change to our new addition, the determination was made by staff that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| constituted major changes that would require a new hearing at MPC. So I do want to advise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| council that we've submitted that application to be on the August 12th MPC hearing. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| to be frank, I suspect it will be before City Council in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| But in that application, you are asking for the 58 spaces as part of your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| All right. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Thank you, Mayor. I know there are some people that came to speak to this issue, and I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| like to offer them that opportunity. I know the appellant's attorney is here. If anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| would still like to speak, I'd like to hear from them at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Mr. King, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Mayor, members of council, I'm John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=604)|
| 0:10:13| As the motion is stated by Mr. Swanson, and that is to withdraw the application for variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=613)|
| 0:10:24| with the consequent result that that obviates or does away with the BZA action which granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| the variance. In other words, we don't have a variance. With that being the case, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| I speak for the group of people that I represent, being property owners and citizens of South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| Knox, that we don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| Okay. There's others to speak, and I think I'm assuming that Mr. King is going to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| for those others who signed up there. Okay. There's a motion and a second on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| there. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Nobody else wants to speak that signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| I looked, and nobody else is making a move toward that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=665)|
| 0:11:18| I'll just add. Ron Peabody, 625 South Gay Street. As long as, I'll only add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=678)|
| 0:11:27| I helped Mr. Mudrich file the appeal of this variance allowance from BZA, and I'll just make one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=687)|
| 0:11:35| I think the process that's been laid out actually by Mr. Arning today is exactly what we'd like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| We would like to see him to go back to NBC, redo the use on review, and I think that's acceptable to the group here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=702)|
| 0:11:50| and myself, and the attorney. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| Thanks. Any other comments then? Okay. Ready to vote? All those in favor of the motion, aye? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| Those no? Okay. Thank you. Other items dealing with the agenda. Anything else to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| Okay. Items for postponement. Mr. Whithall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you, Mayor. I would like to postpone 9A, which is the ordinance dealing with domesticated chickens for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=727)|
| 0:12:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Basically, as I've explained at the R4 workshop, and I tried to get the word out because it's summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| I've had a difficult time getting a lot of the stakeholders together. So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| Thank you. Okay. Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| Yeah. It's probably going to be very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| We haven't voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| I've got another. We need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| Okay. So, that wasn't on this. Okay. Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| Okay. All those in favor of postponing, make sure I get the number right, 9A? Aye? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| Those no? Okay. Thank you. It is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| Anything else for postponement? Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| I would like to talk about or make the motion to postpone 12A on the changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=779)|
| 0:13:11| And the reason being, you know, I know we've been all around this and it's been going on a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| But Councilman Grieve is not here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| And probably collectively, he spent more time on this one issue than all of us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| And my hope is, is that within four weeks that he can be back with us and be here to cook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=811)|
| 0:13:41| because I really do think that he could put a lot into the discussion, the debate of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| It's a very important issue to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| And I just think that his presence here and what he could add to this discussion is very important to this council and to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=829)|
| 0:14:01| Four-week postponement? Four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| Is there a second to that? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| Okay. Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| I actually would like us to talk about a postponement of other than four weeks because I will not be here at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| It looks like I will not be here on the August 10th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| So if we could maybe do two or six, it would feel better for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Six. I would enter six then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Probably better six than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Okay. Is that okay with the second, Mr. Woodhull? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| Other discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| The motion is to postpone for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| I know there are some folks here in the audience to speak to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| And if any of you all would like to speak to that, you're welcome to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| I know there's at least a couple of folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| So if anybody would like to speak to that, you're welcome to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| If not, I will see other discussion from Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Yeah, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| You know, I'm one that has been going down this path for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| And this particular issue was brought back because some felt it was overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| And I'm more of the opinion that we ought to look at a postponement for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| and see if Duane is going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| And then, you know, we've gone through this on the last council about postponing issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| based on our own personal schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| And I'd just like for us not to try to start doing that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| because it just makes the people's agenda so difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| So I guess, you know, I'm more of the opinion we ought to try it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| And if it doesn't work out, we can discuss it and postpone it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| This would be the fifth postponement of this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| It began on February 2, 2009, when Vice Mayor Becker, Councilman Becker at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=942)|
| 0:15:50| brought this forth and it was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Two weeks later it was tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| And then October 20, 2009, Councilmember Hall brought this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| And I spoke with Councilman Hall, former Councilman Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| and he said the reason to bring this forward was that in the whole sign package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| that this was a small component that he thought had gotten lost in the shuffle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| So that was why he brought that back out on October 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| It went to MPC, and at that point it was postponed for 12 weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| came back out on April the 6th, postponed for four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| came back out on May the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| I guess on May the 4th it was postponed another six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| And so now on the 15th of June it was postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| So obviously the sign issue is going along without any action to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| for almost, well, a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| A postponement of two, four, six weeks will just be one more in this series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Well, and I agree with Councilwoman Palmer and Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| I mean, they both make good, valid points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| but I don't think it's about an individual member of council being here or not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| It's more about Councilman Grieve who can't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| And I do think that, given the circumstances that he's going through right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| that perhaps six weeks would be better than two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| And that's why I would amend my motion to make it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| to maybe that ensures that he would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| And I know it's been drawn out, but, again, I think Councilman Grieve has spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| and I know he has, a tremendous amount of time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| It's very important to our city, for people on both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| But I just really want to address this one with full council, if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| and particularly with his input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| I'm going to go ahead and make a different kind of suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| I think we have, fortunately, a very short agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| And several times in dealing with this issue, the broad issue of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| this council has talked about this issue for an hour, an hour and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| and then decided to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| And I think what I almost want to suggest is that we try talking about this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| But potentially, I think you're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I tend to support you on the question of how much value Councilman Grieve could bring to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| We might have some ideas on next steps with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| This is just first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| And my sense is, at some point, we have a fair likelihood of sending this back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| which means we get a whole bunch more bites at the apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| So I think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| And since it's a short meeting, maybe we ought to just try seeing what we can do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| I'm just curious, how many people have signed up to speak to this tonight, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| We actually have two folks signed up to speak, both against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1143)|
| 0:19:13| Again, I apologize for those that, you know, we don't take action for those that have come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| I know you've spent your time, but I hope you understand my feelings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| We know that Councilman Grieves won't be here in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| I'd say it's too hard to say right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| If we postpone this for six weeks, that brings it to August the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| And based on the conversation I had with him today, I would say that by the 24th, which is six weeks, he would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1179)|
| 0:19:51| Our next meeting is July the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| And I think his position then will be the same as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| He wants to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| He planned to be here tonight, but that didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| And it could be the same thing on the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| The greatest likelihood that he will be back with us, at least half steam, if not full steam, would be on August the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1207)|
| 0:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Yeah, I just wanted to add that I think that we already have an ordinance in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| so there's nothing untoward that's going to happen if we do postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| That is that we have a signed ordinance that has application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| The question is, is there relief from that to change the footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| And so I don't see a harm in postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| I do think if there are people in the audience that have come to speak, that we should hear them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| because I think as a matter of courtesy, people spend a lot of time rearranging their plans to get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| and I think we would benefit from their input whether we act or not tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| I haven't seen either of the two, and my guess is they'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| But if you'd like to come speak now, either Joyce or Charlotte, you obviously can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| So if you'd like to now, or you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Right now the motion is to postpone for six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| Is that right, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Well, I'm going to reverse my opinion, and I'm for the postponement for whatever that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| I do want to support Councilman Bailey and his idea that this postponement with Councilman Grieve is a real exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| I would like to not see us get in the practice of doing this because someone can't be here for other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I'm going to move to a vote right now unless I see somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| The motion on the floor is to postpone for six weeks on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1306)|

| 0:22:31| It's been a little bit of a headache nuisance to us, but we're going to have the ribbon cutting for the 100 block of Gay Street streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| Now, we won't be totally finished then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1358)|

| 0:25:32| and see if we can't prevent something like that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1532)|

| 0:25:38| and we can't prevent those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| but at least we can get together and see if we can't find some ways to prevent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1545)|

| 0:29:22| and we have about 250 cameras all over the city in different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| We can tie into that system and watch everything that goes on over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| We can also use the security officers that we have today and expand upon those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| I'm really nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| We're all friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| But, no, we do have the security force in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| We have a lot of individuals already in place, and in the transit center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| I think the thing that Cat found is they're not truly set up today to manage janitorial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| and some of those other items where they would have to pull somebody off the bus route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| and a trolley system or something to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| With PBA, we already have those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| We have supervisors in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| If we're contracting those services, we are bidding out that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| We pull evaluation teams, and we pull city and county into those meetings and review all those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| Which parts of the contract might you typically bid out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Janitorial sometimes, grounds sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| This facility is a little bit different because of the green roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| We will be managing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| It has some different things with the Silver LEED certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| It's made some challenges in our budget as to what is truly needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| We're trying to go at this very carefully but also conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| I think today the value we have with the comp center in place and security officers on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| we can pull from the city-county building if we would need to in case of an emergency or something over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1851)|
| 0:31:01| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| The bids for the janitorial service, has that already been let out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| Yes, it has, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| There were three bids that came in, and I believe that was awarded to special touches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| and that is a minority-owned vendor and good group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| We worked with them at the World's Fair Park and different other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Just real quick, we got the handout here, Mr. Anderson, sort of with the budget, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| On the last page of it, it's got all these things that are in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| It indicates these are costs that we're not going to have this year, but we expect to have next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| and that comes to $43,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| And I know, Mr. Anderson, that the contract, we're trying to ballpark this because these are all sort of guesses about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1912)|
| 0:32:01| Do we have an expectation, and I guess this is a two-parter about long-term expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| do we have an expectation that next year's contract is going to be $550,000 roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| And beyond that, are there any escalators built into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Is there any level at which we sort of are planning increased costs as things go along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| I think this year is a best-guess scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| You add up all the subcontractors, and you guess how often you're going to have to clean the floor and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| But as you go through it, depending on traffic, depending on weather, we'll get a better handle on it as the year goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| When we were cutting the budget, or trying to, I guess, value engineering the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| as close as we could get was about 5% higher than this, somewhere around $529,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1968)|
| 0:32:57| But what we thought, since we're not starting July 1st, we try our best to stay within the budget that we had asked council for originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1977)|
| 0:33:05| but allow in the contract the possibility, at PBA's request, to consider a budget amendment sometime during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1985)|
| 0:33:14| And let me ask, related to that, this is a five-year contract, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| Is this something that the process is going to be, we will do our budget that takes effect on July 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| and this will be factored in there, and sort of the annual payments will be worked into our budget to go to PBA to manage this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2006)|
| 0:33:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Jane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Do we also do the other CAT buildings on Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| In other words, is PBA managing those for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| We are not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| We have been contacted about adding the card access system and some security features at the new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| They're also looking at the janitorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| I think that this facility is so much larger and there will be so much more traffic at this location that it's a new endeavor for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2041)|
| 0:34:10| And they feel like they'll be faced with some, there's a lot of buses coming in all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| There'll be some issues possibly with homeless and other things in that area that we will have to make sure that we've got them covered for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| So we're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| We've got them all prepared with the badge system, and we manage that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| We take care of whoever is going to be throughout their card access system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| We do background checks on all of them and all of the vendors that will be working in the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| And then that is what they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| We'll tie that system in to the CAT Magnolia facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| And the Magnolia facility is going to go through some remodeling, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| It is currently being remodeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Are you managing the remodeling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| PBA property development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| That's a different set of PBAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Different groups, but under PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| But they also, Jeff Gallion is managing that project for PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| One more quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| There's part of this budget where it says education and training, $10,000, training for LEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| Now, I know LEED is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Are we confident that it will win?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Is that an annual expense, or is that a one-time sort of front end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| And is this something that we know we're going to save money anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| that the $10,000 is, again, an investment as opposed to an expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| It should just be a one-time expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| We're getting all of our people up on the LEED recertification process and commissioning, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| that we are required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| So it's one time, and it sort of makes sure that we're doing all the things to save all the money that that should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| So the facility is taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2154)|

| 0:36:47| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Mr. King, as a representative of council for the KUB tree trim panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| we have concerns about trees and utility wires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| and I noted there's a list of trees that are approved and accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| Are you working with KUB to be sure that we get the right tree near the utility lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| No, it's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| Cindy, leave that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Yo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| I take it that the total budget for trees will be $60,000, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| We'll have 40 in the hopper, and we're going to try to get 20 more as part of this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| And how does that compare to prior years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Do you have some reference to last year or the year before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| I think that's pretty consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| That's kind of the level we've been working at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| We did achieve the same grant last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| I think we had 40,000 last year, and we got 20 from the state, so we had 60 last year also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| I notice in the specifications by the state that they provide for watering for the first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| and in drought periods in the second and third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| We were blessed last summer with a lot of rain that was good for our trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| I notice this summer we have some really ailing trees along highways that have been planted in a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| Can you tell us what we're doing to try to keep them alive in the tough drought-type periods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| Well, with this program, the contractor or the vendor gives us a year warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| The first year after first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| After that, it would be up to our horticultural services to provide any watering if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| But that is a difficult thing for us to keep up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| We have done some watering in particularly difficult situations like downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| You may have seen some of the little doughnuts around the base of the tree that you can fill up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| The mulch rings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| No, it's a flexible membrane material that you fill up with water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| A little reservoir, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Yes, and then we also do some watering by hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| But in a drought period, it is difficult to keep the trees in good health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| and that's one of the reasons in future installations we're looking at options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| where we can direct water off the street into these tree pits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| As you engineer the contour of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| So that you'll get the flow towards where it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| But that will only be in new street construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| But that's a good advance in terms of how you engineer a street so that you're protecting that center island, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2385)|

| 0:40:27| Is this the major way we're able to buy our buses with the federal transportation grant stuff, Sam, or someone else out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2433)|

| 0:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Without these monies, we don't replace the existing rolling stock, I guess, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265100713?start=2443)|
