| 0:00:30| Welcome to the Board of Education's November 3rd work session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=30)|
| 0:00:40| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=40)|
| 0:00:45| I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=45)|
| 0:01:10| Please be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=70)|
| 0:01:27| As was public notice, the Board met in Executive Session this afternoon at 4.30 with members from the Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| Mr. DeBoer, would you mind explaining that a little for the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=94)|
| 0:01:41| Sure, we'd be happy to. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| The Board meets with our office from time to time to discuss litigation and potential litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| It's not a time for the Board to deliberate at all, it's just simply for the Board to ask questions to the Law Department and the Law Department gives the Board information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=110)|
| 0:02:00| It's been recognized in several court cases including Smith County Education v. Anderson. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=120)|
| 0:02:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| In other announcements, we have a Policy Review Meeting scheduled for Wednesday, November 17th at 1.30 p.m. in the Andrew Johnson Building Boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=132)|
| 0:02:21| Also, several Board members will be attending the TSBA Leadership Conference and Annual Convention in Nashville November 18th through the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=141)|
| 0:02:31| And moving to the agenda, are there any requested changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=151)|
| 0:02:39| We have a motion to approve the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| So a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Ms. Horne. All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| Any opposed? Motion carries. So I will turn it over to Superintendent Thomas for your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board. I have a few brief updates for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| I'd like to begin by sharing two important opportunities for students, employees, and families to provide feedback about the work of KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| Our district has developed a plan to gather insight into the expected role and relationships of law enforcement with students, staff, school administration, and school personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=188)|
| 0:03:18| This will include individual interviews with community leaders, focus groups, and an electronic survey to be sent in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| On Monday, families received a questionnaire to gauge their interest in participating in one of the focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| Space is limited and participants will be selected through a process developed by our Research, Evaluation, and Assessment Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| with the goal of having representative groups from across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| As I've said before, I believe it's important to provide law enforcement officers in each of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| including both school security officers hired by KCS and school resource officers provided by our law enforcement partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| Our district is also committed to receiving community feedback about these important partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| and I'm confident that this process will help us accomplish that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| I also want to highlight a district-wide survey that will be sent later this month and is related to the 2022-23 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| The survey will focus on the district's fiscal priorities as well as strategies to improve engagement with our stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=254)|
| 0:04:21| I would also like to give an update about our district's work to promote educational equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| As many of you know, the Disparities in Education Outcomes Steering Committee has worked for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| on strategies to eliminate disparities in discipline and educational outcomes among various student groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| The DEO's original five-year mandate expired this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| but I'm pleased to report that the committee will continue its work with some important changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| Going forward, the committee will now be operating as the Alliance for Educational Equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| I believe this name change not only reflects the importance of our partnership with community stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| but also highlights the goal of promoting equity in our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| Our first quarterly meeting took place on October 26th at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| The meeting went very well, I'm pleased to report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| and the committee took the important step of adopting a definition of equity for our work, which reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| Championing the individual cultures, identities, talents, abilities, languages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| and interests of each student to maximize academic success and social-emotional well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| by promoting that they receive educational opportunities and resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| even when this means differentiating resource allocations to meet their unique circumstances and educational aspirations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| And the committee voted to accept that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| In closing, I finally want to acknowledge the tragic loss that occurred last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| when Junior Santiago, a student at Fulton High School, was killed by gunfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| As our community continues to seek solutions to the issue of gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| I want to offer my deepest sympathies to Junior's family, friends, and the Fulton High School community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| With that, I will yield the microphone to Steve Rutter for the next installment of our Data Spotlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Members of the board, I appreciate you having me back here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| So, if you remember, one moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| So, if you remember the last time I was here, we talked a little bit about our district-wide student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| And so, one of the things about this student achievement is that what it tells us is what a group of students knows at a certain point in time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=385)|
| 0:06:36| So, they take the 10 ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| The state classifies them as on track, mastered, approaching, or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| And so, we get an indication of what our students know in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| So, what achievement doesn't inform us of is how much progress our students make, right, over the course of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| So, that's where these growth models come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| So, growth models are intended to kind of measure student progress throughout between two points in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=416)|
| 0:07:05| In this case, it's actually more than one school year, right, because we didn't test in 1920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| So, it would be over the course of two school years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| And the model we use in the state of Tennessee, I'm sure you all know this and have heard it, is TVOS, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| So, TVOS, at its heart, is really just an estimate that tries to quantify the amount of progress a group of students make in a particular grade or subject area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=440)|
| 0:07:30| compared to other similar students across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| And so, when I say similar students across the state of Tennessee, what I mean by that is students who have performed similarly in the past on the TCAP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| to whatever group of students we're talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| So, when you take student growth information along with student achievement information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| you really get a more complete and holistic picture of student learning over the course of a school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| So, when we talk about TVOS, generally what you hear people talking about are effectiveness levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| So, I wanted to take a moment to make sure we're all on the same page about what TVOS levels mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| because TVOS levels are easily the most misinterpreted thing that we talk about for school data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| So, first of all, a TVOS level is an indication of two things all at one time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| So, it is, first and foremost, it's an indication of whether students exceeded, met, or failed to meet their growth expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=503)|
| 0:08:33| based on a comparison of students like them from other parts of the state of Tennessee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| So, did they do as well as students like them, not as well, or about the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| And the other part that's real important is it provides a level of evidence about how certain we can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| that they either met that benchmark or beat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| So, what TVOS levels don't indicate is the amount of growth students experience over the course of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=535)|
| 0:09:04| There's some other things that we can look at to determine that, but TVOS levels, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| it's not accurate to say students who, a group of students who earned a TVOS level 5 grew a whole lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| than a group of students who earned a TVOS level 3, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| What we're talking about is certainty when we're talking about these levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| So, if we look at the top on the TVOS level 5, so what that would indicate is there is strong evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| that this group of students we're talking about, in this case it would be our, we're talking about high school students tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| so there's strong evidence that our students exceeded or did better on the state test, the TCAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=575)|
| 0:09:44| than students like them from across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| The level 4 is similar, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| So, our group of students exceeded or did better on the state exam than their comparison group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| but the evidence isn't quite as compelling for that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Level 3 is the too close to call, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| So, they performed similarly enough to students like them that we don't really know which side of that line they fell on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| so we say that they met their growth expectation because they performed similar to other students all across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| Level 2 is there is some evidence that they didn't grow as much as students like them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| and then level 1 is there's strong evidence that they didn't grow as much like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| So, I hope that made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| So, that's, it's hard to, TVOS is a complicated subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| It's hard to describe it in a few minutes, but that was my best effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| So, Ms. Satterfield asked if we could look at specifically high school TVOS today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| and so when we look at, when I looked at the TVOS or the growth levels of effectiveness for the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| we had a pretty good year in terms of like the district overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| So, we were, we had a district-wide composite of a level 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| so that means our students in all, when we take all subject areas, put it together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| our students perform better on the state exam than students that looked like them in the past for all subjects, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=664)|
| 0:11:15| Our numeracy, we were also a level 5, and our literacy, we were a level 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| So, that's all good, those are all good, good indicators, and that's what we want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| But when you start pulling it apart by grade band like we're doing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| what becomes pretty evident is like we had really strong growth in our elementary grades, 3 through 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| and the evidence of growth gets weaker in the middle grades, and it's the weakest at the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| and so you're going to see some of that here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| All right, so this is a chart that shows each of our 15 high schools and their school-wide TVOS composites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| So, you can see this is kind of mixed results here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| So, what we really want to see is TVOS levels of 3, 4, or 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| so they either met or exceeded growth expectations in those instances, and there's evidence of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| So, 7 of our schools earned a level 3, 4, or 5, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| 8 of our schools earned either a level 1 or 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| So, we usually look quite a bit stronger than this, so I think, again, the pandemic probably had some impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=735)|
| 0:12:26| and if you recall from last time I discussed, the participation rate, especially for high school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| was not up to snuff when we compared to previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| We tested about 80 to 85 percent of our students in high school subjects compared to a normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| like pre-pandemic year, we would have tested 99 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| So, to me, that's an indication of the motivation to engage with the assessment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| Like, I think that, you know, the assessment not counting as a part of their grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| and all the interruptions to instruction kind of had an impact on how hard these students tried on the test this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=780)|
| 0:13:08| So, that's a Steve Rutter theory, that's not, I can't prove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| So, one thing before I move on from this slide, though, I want to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| I need to give a shout-out to South Tooele High School because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| because, because not just were they the only high school that had a school-wide composite of a level 5 this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=802)|
| 0:13:31| they've had a school-wide composite of a level 5 since 2015, and the year before that, they were a level 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| So, that is an extremely long period to, like, demonstrate evidence of student academic growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| and it doesn't happen by accident, it happens by being focused and working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| And so, Tim Berry and all the teachers out there, man, they should be proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| I'm sure they're aware that they should be proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| Can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| I know I sat on something with the state talking about TCAPs, especially when you get to high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| because you have the kids that are in, like, AP classes, really your top students don't end up taking the TCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=843)|
| 0:14:12| So, how does that sort of skew numbers, or is it that you're just comparing the same kind of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| across the board for the state so it evens it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| So, it's, so, the way TVOS works, I'm going to talk about it, I'm going to talk about it in terms of one student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| because it's easier to understand that way, but it's really groups of students we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| So, like, if I'm a student and I've taken the TCAP since I was in third grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| so what's happening is it's comparing my performance to another student whose test history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=874)|
| 0:14:42| like all the way back to third grade, looks very similar to mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| So, and it's comparing how I did on this year's test to how they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| So, if I do similarly, they say, okay, you met the growth expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| If I do better, you exceeded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| And if you don't do as well, you did not meet the growth expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Yes, I just, what I'm wondering is what happens in high school when you've got these kids that are all taking it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| and we're not in that pool to control it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Well, so, for high school, they all take English 1 and English 2, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| They all take Algebra 1, Algebra 2, and Geometry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| So, and that's what's included in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Every student will end up taking those courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Even if they're, like, an AP class and they just all end up taking English 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| Yeah, West High School is maybe an exception to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| So, most places AP starts at the junior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| Am I right about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| So, yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| So, the next slide breaks this down for just our literacy subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| So, this is the English 1 and English 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| So, again, it's a similar picture to the last slide that we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| So, seven of our schools were level 3, 4, or 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| and then eight of our schools were level 1 or 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| which, you know, suggests they didn't do quite as well as students like them across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| Ms. Horn also has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Yeah, and I think, I mean, I just want to make sure I'm clearly understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| So, basically what you're saying, back to the other slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| basically you're saying that this is only comparative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| so it doesn't really actually indicate proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| So, I think that's important to make sure we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| It's just a, it's comparative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| and you're not even comparing the same kids to their own performance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| Yeah, what it's trying to do is to take into account, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| so how a student enters into the school building at the beginning of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| can definitely impact proficiency, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Like if they're really far behind, like that student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| it's going to be difficult for them to catch all the way back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| But, like, for TVOS, that student can still make progress, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| And so what TVOS is trying to measure is the amount of progress that students make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| So, if you have a school that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| if you have a kid that already is making the highest grade possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| their TVOS is going to be a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Like, even kids at the top, like there's safeguards built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| Students at the top can still grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| I've always been, like, a little confused by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| because it seems like if you've made 100 and you make 100 this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| that's not actually growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Well, there's not a lot of students that make 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| There's very few of those, because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| they design these tests so that there's super difficult questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| because the idea is they're trying to separate student performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| And so I'm not saying that it doesn't happen, because it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| but even those students, like, there's still room for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| And remember, we're not talking about one student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| We're talking about a group of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| So, it's unlikely that every single kid in a school is going to perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| exactly the same as they did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| So, our literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| You didn't make the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| So, our numeracy looks a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| So, this is normally, this is more a normal picture of what we see when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| we're looking at school, high school TVOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| So, here we have nine of our schools that met or exceeded growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| expectations, and then the other six were ones or twos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| So, and we had, you know, four of our schools where there's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| strong evidence that they exceeded that growth expectation and did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| better on the TCAP than students like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| I have a quick question, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Going back to literacy, does this, and it might not even have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| correlation, because I know that's one of the biggest things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| talk about from the strategic level of, like, increasing literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| Like, with the numbers that we have here, does this, is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| correlation between those two or can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Between achievement and growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Not even achievement, but are we making progress in making the literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| approach that we have talked about for the last couple of years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Well, this is high school, so, like, a lot of our literacy is based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| lower grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| But, yeah, so, like, so, you know, again, like, at TVOS level three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| four, or five, is what it's saying is, like, your kids, the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| are performing better than students that have had, like, similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| testing backgrounds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| And so, as a district, you know, we're, like, we were level four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| So that's pretty decent evidence that our students are growing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| than other students across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| So, okay, so this, the last couple slides have to do with student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| groups, and this is a relatively new occurrence in TVOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| We have never gotten this up until the 18-19 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| We never got student group growth information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| So this is fairly new, and there's kind of a lot going on in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| chart, so let me explain what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| So for this one, each bar represents a student group, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| So the first four bars are student racial groups, and then the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| three bars are what we called last week our accountability groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| So in each segment in each of these stacked bar charts represents a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| portion of the schools who earned a certain TVOS level, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| So the green segments represent the portion of schools who earned a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| level five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| The teal is the portion of schools that earned a level four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Red is level three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Two is, or orange is level two, and blue is level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| So, for example, if we look at the bar on the far right, our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| with disabilities group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| So you can see that we had just over 14 percent of our schools earned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| a level five for their students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Seven percent earned a level four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| Sixty-four percent earned a level three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| Fourteen percent earned a level two, and nobody was a level one for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| our students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| I like this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| So, you know, but it's kind of hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| There's kind of a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| So the last slide I tried to simplify it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| So it's kind of the same information, but what I did on this one was I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| combined the level three, four, and five into the orange segments, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| the ones and twos into the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| So the good part about this slide is that there's a lot of orange on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| screen, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| And that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| So, you know, pointing out a couple of things that are on there, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| our English learners, every single school that had enough students to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| have an English learner student group had a met or exceeded growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| expectations for that group, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| So that's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| We almost did the same thing for our Hispanic students, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| So 12 out of 13 schools met or exceeded growth expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| And then our students with disabilities is pretty high as well up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| at 86% of our schools met or exceeded growth expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| So I think overall this is a really positive slide, and I think a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| people would be surprised that the student group with kind of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| weakest evidence of growth were our white student group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| So that has, like, that's the benefit of taking into account past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| performance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Because it eliminates a lot of the kind of, it's not bias, but a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| the impact of coming into the school kind of behind, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| So that's all I had for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Does anybody have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| Mr. Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| So, Mr. Roeder, so I just kind of going back to the beginning, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| say that for TVOS, what they're doing is comparing students who are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| quote, unquote, like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| So just for the public, what, like, how are you categorizing students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| who are like each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Is it just based on test scores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| So, like, I'm not doing it, but the state, like, SAS is a statistical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| software company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| They do it for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| So essentially what, I'm trying to simplify this much again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| So what they're doing is they're taking, like, all the tests you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| ever taken and all your classmates' tests they've ever taken, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| they're finding a group of students whose information looks very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| And then once you take these exams, they say, okay, that group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| students, you know, they earned, on average, this scaled score on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| exam, but your class earned 10 points higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| So they're going to say you exceeded the growth expectation because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| did better than all the other students that look like you in terms of past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| performance on these tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| So it's all correlations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| You know, it's a complex statistical model, but it's really all just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| correlations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Did that help answer your question at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Yeah, I think it's just that, like, when you say students like them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| it's not clear, like, how, like, what were we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Were we talking about breaking down by race?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Were we talking about breaking down by color?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| I didn't catch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| So, like, when you say students like them, it's, like, I guess some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| people might have questions about, like, is it just, like, are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| based on race?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Is it categorized just based on scores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| So in this case, it would be scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| There's no covariates other than how you did on tests in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Like, they don't consider anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| It would just be high scores and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| So, you know, some states have other models where they do include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| other variables, but Tennessee does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| So what that means is, from a technical standpoint, any one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| individual student may actually shift groups over time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| Because every test would re-inform the grouping that you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| actually be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| And I'm using terms like they do all this at once, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| There's no actual group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| But, yeah, but, you know, students' growth expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| hopefully will change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| It could get higher and higher and higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| My point in saying that is TVOS data is not really helpful at an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| individual level in terms of a student, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| We don't get it at an individual level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| So it's not helpful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| And so, Steve, you may not be able to answer this, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| somebody here can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| This type of data, how does it get operationalized in the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| Like, as we receive this year to year, how might the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| react to this data and shift things operationally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| And I'm sure there's a lot of possibilities, but is there some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| examples that can be offered up in terms of how does this data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| impact what we're actually doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| I'm going to let John enter that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Thanks, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| So next time, like, just before I step away, does anybody have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| any other questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| So the next time I come back, I think Ms. Christy asked to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| a little bit more about student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| So the scope of that is a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| So it's maybe not a data moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| It's maybe like a data half hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| But at that point, I think we will probably exhaust all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| state stuff that we can talk about at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Thanks, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| So one thing that our REA department does a great job of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| doing, because I think in our past, you can overreact to data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| I guess that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| So they do a great job of when we communicate that to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| I like one way they talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| They talk about it about flags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| I was just telling Russ a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| I like to see the achievement data with the growth data because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| it tells sometimes, and I know Steve did that previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| it kind of tells the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| To Ms. Horn's point, you know, Farragut may be a level five in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| achievement, but we saw some places there where they may be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| level one in growth, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| And so when two flags are pointing different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| there's a story and a narrative with that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| And one's not necessarily better than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| There's a room for improvement on all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| So I think to operationalize, what we typically do with this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| the schools will get their data, they'll have their conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| they'll look in the specific areas where they are struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| or not struggling, they'll look in areas where they've done well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| or where they're struggling, either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| and they'll try to tell the story or their narrative based on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| they're seeing on those flags of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| These are two state data places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Lots of schools also look at student data and they score that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| and look at that over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Some schools are using other data sources as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| more in elementary, but things like iReady or other kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| formative assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| We have Case 21 that will be coming on board, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| There will be another data source once we get the ESSER plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| So I think you look at all those in a practice, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| that our REA did a couple years ago before all the COVID interruptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| to data was kind of you predict prior to the data coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| so you kind of know what you expected and what you planned for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| and where you spent your time and resource and energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| And then when the data comes, you look back at that and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| well, did it match?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Lots of times it does because they know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| and there can be anything in those stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| I know I was looking at some of those high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| texting with Mr. Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| I know one of those high schools lost three of their English teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| this year and their first-year teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| So that has an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| So you look at all those things to tell those stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Our grade-level directors and supervisors then work with those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| and they build out their individual state plans that are turned into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| state, that here's their areas of focus for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| and then what they're going to do on an individual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| to operationalize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| So on a district level, what that changes our focus on really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| is not a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| We don't adopt the different textbooks or change a curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| Those kinds of things would be pretty big ripples to a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| We do provide support through, like, our micro-team structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| where we talked about before, where they're assigned to different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Our subject area folks and our grade-level directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| well, they'll go in and try to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| It could be professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| It could be modeling lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| It could be sitting in their professional learning communities as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| plan and look through things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Sometimes it is certain schools want to try a different curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| or a different sort of thing with that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| and we'll work with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| But at that point, it's kind of an individual school basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| based on the data, and our grade-level directors kind of follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| through that throughout the year and see how they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| on their progress with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| And at the school level, those reports or those plans that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| producing for the state relative to this data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| they're setting goals relative to those benchmarks for the school, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| Like a school in that plan would say, hey, we're going to try to hit this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| and here's how we're going to get there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| And the order of how that goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| the district too has to submit their plan annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| So we'll use the data that Steve's presented now to present where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| actually our team's beginning to work on that for a submission in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| that sets kind of the, again, there's not a whole lot of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| There's going to be something around English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| There's going to be something around math, something around college going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| you know, like all the college readiness, those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| So all that will be in the district plan based on the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and there will be some tweaks or some maybe professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| or things that we'll be doing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| And then schools then look under those categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| and where it makes sense to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| They prioritize off those goals based on their individual data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| and that's what they submit to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| approved through their grade level directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| I just want to say thank you, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| to reiterate the purpose of these data moments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| it's just for us to have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| and just to see what's happening in our school levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| and to pay that respect to all the hard work that's going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| regardless of what the score says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| like schools are doing the work every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| and so I want to make sure that we're always talking at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| about our schools and our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| and the outcomes when it comes to academic achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| So thank you for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| and if board members have any specific data that they want to check out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| let's use this as an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| So see you next month, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| So before we move on to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| board members, you received an email update yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| and I just want to note that items 8C, 16, and 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| were added after the agenda was published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| due to the time-sensitive nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| with student, teachers, and interns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| being able to begin spring semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Also, the captions and backup documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| for items 10E, a UWorld grant for Austin East High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| and 12G, a Second Amendment to our charter school agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| with Emerald Academy were updated for our consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| So I think everyone received an email on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| So moving on to discussion of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| On the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| does anyone have any questions on 1, 2, or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1929)|
| 0:32:18| 4, 5, or 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| 7 or 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| I would just like Scott to speak to the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| why we have the partnership agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| and how that's helping to grow our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Great question, Madam Chair, rest of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| So when we're talking about the educator prep programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| those are the programs that provide us with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| They have to be approved by the State Department of Ed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| and there's a process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| So you'll notice as we go through a lot of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| we'll see a thing like a primary partnership agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| And we have a primary partnership agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| specifically with University of Tennessee, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| with LMU, and with Johnson University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| And those are agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| in which we are at the table with these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| and we can lean in and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| what we think our candidates should know instructionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| when they come into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| A lot of times what you'll see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| aside from those three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| would be just state-recognized partnership agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| So we've got a person that wants to student teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| from, I don't know, maybe East Tennessee State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| That's a state-recognized partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| and we're not a primary partner with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| meaning we haven't gone through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| we haven't had an impact on the development of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| But we have a recognized partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| so that we can allow their teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| to come into our district for the purpose of student teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| A lot of times what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| we have a lot of school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| and for us it's problematic because they use language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| that makes it very similar to a memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| There's a lot of legal binding language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| in both a state-approved partnership agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| and a primary partnership agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| A lot of our EPPs don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| that we have an extra step when it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| So a lot of times what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| if they go to a smaller school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| the smaller school district will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| oh, that's just your partnership agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| we'll just sign off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| And then, okay, that's good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| But because it has that legal binding language in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| it has to go before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| So the state have guidelines or deadlines that have to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| And we may not get forms from an EPP and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| oh, we want a student teacher to be in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| but they don't realize that it's not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| that we can route to the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| just for his signature because it has that agreement language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Now, what's nice about these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| is it is heavy on the collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| It's real heavy on the collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| It allows us to modify programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| For example, you've seen regularly UTK come across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| it's almost like we do modifications and changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| to their MOU on an annual basis, it seems like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| because we're changing the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| I mean, we added our Grow Your Own programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| and memorialized those in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| We've pushed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Historically, UTK was a five-year program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| where you would complete your undergraduate degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| and then you would do a year-long internship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| all the while taking graduate courses in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| You would terminate from UTK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| with a master's degree at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| It was typically a five-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Well, after looking at some research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| that was kind of a stumbling block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| for maybe our educators of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| because now you're asking a person to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| and do a year-long internship without having a livable wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| So we kind of addressed that with Grow Your Own 1.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| And we also leaned in further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Now, in the University of Tennessee's program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| the majority of their programs are accomplished in four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| And it's a semester internship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| But it's embedded with those practical placements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| to try to remedy that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| So it's given us an opportunity to have those hard discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| to address our needs as a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| I hope that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| No, it did. Thank you, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| And again, I just want to kind of lift up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| and show what the district is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| to the ripple effect of not having educators in the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| Like, we're going to have to continue to tap in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| into these agreements to figure out ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| to get new teachers into our pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| So any other discussion on those items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| And four through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| Items 10 and 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| 12 and 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| 14 and 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| 16 or 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2240)|
| 0:37:29| And board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Any discussion on 9, 8, or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2251)|

| 0:37:59| 10 grants and discussions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2279)|

| 0:38:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I'm making sure that the agenda that I downloaded the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| has got the right number on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| On F, with the donated acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| I know it's close to Powell Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| but it's not adjacent to Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Is there an intended use for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| We're already using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| It's got a bus stop on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| We've got over 100 kids who are eligible to catch the bus at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| and a great many of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| So we have student traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| We also have parents who come and drop off students there to catch the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| and wait for the bus to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| So it's already in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| and this is not a piece of property that we were looking to obtain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| but the owner was looking to make a donation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| and we thought it was appropriate given our level of use of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| And contracts, we have 1, 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| Moving on to the regular agenda items, 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| Any discussion on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2372)|

| 0:39:49| G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| So item H, discussion and possible action on superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| Do we have a report from our search committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| We have a public forum as well on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Do you want to bring it up now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Oh, it's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Show me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| I'm going to get my report ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| The superintendent search committee met on October 19th in the A.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| building to flesh out the details regarding working with Tennessee School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| Board Association in search for our next superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| We discussed the importance of finding candidates that have experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| and proven results in improving academic outcomes in school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| similar to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Board member Patty Bounds made the recommendation that we meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| TSBA Executive Director Tammy Grissom in person to learn more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| how TSBA conducts their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| All three committee members agreed to meet Tammy Grissom at a halfway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| point in Cookville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| The meeting with TSBA was successful, and Isabel from News Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| The search committee was able to gain clarity regarding the recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| timeline, how TSBA plans on including Knox County community voices in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| their process, and their plan to recruit as many diverse candidates as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| We were also able to gain insight on potential challenges we can face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| specifically with the superintendent shortage and many superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| vacancies nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| As someone who was adamant about not going with TSBA because of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| lack of diversity representation and their cookie-cutter approach, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| meeting with Tammy and having the conversation, I have full confidence in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| the process that they will be able to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| She was able to go in deep details on how their community meetings work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| how they analyze and synthesize the data provided, and how they'll work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| with the committee to do an extensive research check of all candidates we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| as a board recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| So I want to reiterate that I do feel confident in the process after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| meeting with them because we got a lot more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| TSBA process is a process that will help the board stay on track and reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| our ultimate goal, which is to hire a superintendent for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| For this to be an effective process, community participation is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| That's where we are seeking a board agreement to partner with KEF and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| other community organizations to help organize, market, and sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| community meetings and the candidate in-person visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| Board member Betsy Henderson will provide more insight on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| collaboration that we're seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| You want to go do that now or you want me to finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| So she'll provide more information on the collaboration that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| But lastly, I want to bring our attention to some agenda items, the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| topics that we kind of need to agree on to move things forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| So you have the projected timeline, the community schedule, and Betsy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| will talk about what that looks like and who should be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| We have our salary range that we as a board want to lift up and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| also bring up into the conversation that at the last board meeting we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| had, we voted for up to $11,500 to do Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| However, I also remember at our retreat, we talked about possibly doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| a superintendent evaluation tool, having TSBA create an evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| tool, which is an additional $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| So I would like to see if we can increase that $11,500 to $13,000 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| include the superintendent tool and then also incur any costs from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| three candidate visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| So that concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Feel free to ask any questions that's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| But the purpose of us going and meeting with Tammy was so that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| search committee can have clear understanding on what we're even about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| to do with our search firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Betsy to get the HRSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| You'll do yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| So I'm going to talk about the community input portion of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2652)|
| 0:44:21| since that was a pretty big aspect for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| And I think that this is a great opportunity to have a healthy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| robust relationship between KCS and between our community and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| TSBA will provide a day of community input that includes a variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| focus groups, a lunch, and an evening community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| And those are also included on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| So each forum or each focus group will be a different group, classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| employees, teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| And then in the evening, they will have a community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| If somebody cannot make that day of meetings, there will also be an online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| And any member, I want to stress this too, any member of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| can recommend somebody for superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| So the way TSBA can get in touch with those candidates and talk to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| about the qualifications needed, the job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| So any community member is able to recommend somebody for this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| Once we go through that process and have identified our top three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| candidates, KEF can then help engage the candidates in a day of tours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| lunches in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| I've spoken to KEF about this and they're excited to collaborate with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| and TSBA in collecting community input and working with our candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| And on the lunch for the day of December 2nd, I'm going to have Terry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| we can talk about that, but I'm going to have Terry reach out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| board members and the board members can invite two to three key members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| or community leaders in your district to that luncheon as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2754)|
| 0:46:04| Patty, do you have anything that we missed from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Sure, and all my questions are probably for any of y'all that met with TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| I was wondering if you could talk about when you said that Tammy was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| talking about the lack of superintendents and the number of searches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| kind of what she said was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| Yeah, so it wasn't an in-depth conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| but it was basically the conversation of the larger picture of what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| happening in public education where we have the teacher shortage is also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| reflection of a superintendent's shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| And then also the longevity of superintendents is dwindling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| Historically, we've had superintendents that the average range is like five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| to eight and now it's looking at three to five years and shorter than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| And so there's a lot of vacancies out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| And so she really spoke to staying to this timeline so that we can give the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| offer before, or not even before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| but in time so that we can get the best candidate that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| Because if we get a really strong candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| they're probably going to have a lot of offers and we want to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| extend that offer before somebody else snatches them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| So that was kind of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Okay, and then I was just wondering on the salary piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| if they do anything on helping us know is our salary competitive on kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| consulting on how our salary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| So I did ask for a range of salaries from just average superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| salaries from the size of the school and then also Tennessee salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| And so we have that information and we should give a range and an actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| And I did specifically ask, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| do we also talk about like benefits and all the other stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| And she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| that's usually comes into play when it comes to negotiation time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Sorry, one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| On the focus groups that we're talking about and TSBA comes in and does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| do they then provide a report to us about their findings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| Because I'm really curious to know what a lot of these stakeholder groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| are looking for in a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| They will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| They'll provide a report for each of those focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| as well as the results of the online survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| And she says she's given us every result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| every response that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| So we can look at every single comment that's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| And there was a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| She is coming in person to report that to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Actually, Ms. Bounds is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| has the date been set for that meeting yet with Ms. Grissom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| And so according to the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| I want to make sure I get it right too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| And also the other question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| the second part of that particular question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| is that when we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| so I'm assuming she'll give that to us ahead of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| And then do we as a board then talk about what characteristics we want in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| the superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Is that the order of events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Help me board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| So she's slated to come on December 8th to that meeting to present those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| So the December 8th is representing the reports from the community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| What time of day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| December 2nd will be the day of community meetings and the lunch where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| you would invite key community leaders from your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| And the December 8th will be at our board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| So will we get the information to look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| Well, I guess the other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| do we then have a separate meeting outside of a board meeting to set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Is that on here on this timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| So we adopt the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| So she's going to, so even before the eighth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| we have given the plan that we've selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| They meet with individual board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| And then we also attend that mayor, the meeting, the community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| So that's two opportunities for us as a board to give our criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| criteria into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| She specifically mentioned that she board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| she prefers the only board members go to the one that we are assigned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| And that's the morning breakfast simply because we want our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| members to be able to speak freely as freely as they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| And our teachers and are classified without the presence of a board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| So we'll have two opportunities as a board to give our criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| And then when she reports, if we don't like any of that, then as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| we can say, well, we want to see X, Y, Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| So that meeting at the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| that's where we'll get all of the information from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| from us, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Thank you, Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| First, I want to say thank you to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Appreciate all the work that you all are doing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| I know it's a lot of additional work and I know that you guys are putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| in incredible effort into it and also appreciate having all the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| the timeline and the community meeting schedule and all that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| I think that's really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| So on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| on the timeline piece of it and some of it's some technical things there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| toward the end, I think all that flows well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| And I'm assuming that the March offering of contract is to try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| make sure that we can get an offer early into folks so that they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| potentially get taken up by other districts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Because I know we talked at our retreat about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| about an expanded timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| So I completely agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| I know we also had some conversation about when to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| when a superintendent might start their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| So right here on the timeline, it recommends July one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| which is five weeks before the start of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| We had some conversation about possibly moving that up to June one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| which would give nine weeks and having a little bit of an overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| I'm sure some of that's based on when a new superintendent would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| available, depending on when their school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| their school system lets out that they might be hired at already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| But was there any, did the committee have any conversation about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| I'm glad you asked that because that was a piece that I missed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| So we did bring that up because we were, as a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| we were saying that sounds good to work under kind of learn the ropes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| about Knox County schools and learn from superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| And Tammy Grissom lifted up her experience with doing something in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| And it was basically shared that that can create an environment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| would not be a healthy environment for that month because you have staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| that is unsure who to report to at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| And it can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| it can cause unnecessary conflict when you have somebody that's incoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| and then somebody that's leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| And so it just isn't a healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| but then we also talked about how superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| while he's going to be off in his retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| still very much hopefully willing to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| assist in guidance and if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| And so we did lift that up because we did think that that was an amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| idea, but she's going from her years of experience of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| And she had real concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| And I I've read this detail somewhere, but I don't see the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| So correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| is the goal that they're going to pare down to three finalists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| And if so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| is there an opportunity to potentially offer up more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| I like the idea of more of five finalists that the board are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| Three seems pretty slim to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| So has that been some conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| So we did talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| Well, I haven't been at your committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Did the committee discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| We did talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Because we did talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| We did go in there with saying, Hey, we want five candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| The reason why we do want to let down to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| and this is a board decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| So if the board decision wants to do that, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| Is the February 15th, 16th and 17th are full days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| And in the afternoon, that is when they will present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| And we, as a board, get to ask whatever questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| And so because those are three full days of staff time, board time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| That is the reason why we went with three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| Three versus five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Because it's one day per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Yes, one day per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| So that's why we went with the top three versus the top five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| So that was the rationale behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| And then two last questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| One is related to evaluation tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| I know we did talk about that at our retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| And some of what we talked about was the possibility of looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| employing an aspect of our evaluation that would be a 360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| Was that something that was discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| And does TSBA have do they do that type of evaluation tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| We didn't go in depth about the evaluation tool that they offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| I'm sure that is something we can tell them we want to include into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| evaluation tool if we, as a board, decide to go with that 1500 with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| The reason why I recommend that we do get a superintendent evaluation from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| them is that they can help us craft as we're starting this new process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| start with something new versus what we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| So that's something we can add to that, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| And, Betsy, can you say a little bit more about what you all discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| around KEF's role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| I was a little bit lost in what you were meaning by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| So KEF will do whatever the board wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| So, you know, since TSBA is leading this search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| we've tasked them to do a lot of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| But KEF wants to play a community partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| And so when we've picked the three final candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| they want to help in forming those three days where the candidates come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Yeah, so they will help facilitate that part or any launches that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| to do for those candidates as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| And we also talked about having KEF and whoever may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| but help us market and get as much information out to the community so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| that community can give input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| It's a finite amount of time and the finite amount of time is just to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| sure we stay on the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| But we need as many hands on deck to get it out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| And given what they've been doing with Ford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Next Generation and tapping into different community members that usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| are not involved, then I feel confident that they'll be able to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| push it out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| And then the last thing is not a question, it's an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| I'd love to see for the community to be able to follow this process a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| little bit easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| So, you know, right now unless you happen to be able to go to a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| meeting or one of the committee meetings, which one of them was out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| or if you read Isabel's article, which, you know, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| we had some comments earlier about that's not necessarily the place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| everybody goes to get their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| I'd love to see us develop a page on our website that kind of outlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| it has our timeline once it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| It kind of marks off the milestones as we've met them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| kind of where we are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| I also think it would be good to have a place where we include those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| committee minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Any kind of news that's generated about the search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| I think that could go there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| And then the last thing that I would ask for consideration about is I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| this last year and a half we've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| the community has lost some faith in Knox County Schools and its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| leadership for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| We've gotten a lot of the emails and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| And I think one of the ways to build confidence is to allow the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| to follow this process as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| And I'd like to have some consideration about maybe recording the search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| I don't think it needs to be a live stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| but where there's a record there and people want to go and watch it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| they can and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| So that way they can kind of keep track with that conversation along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| way and not just at the regular board meetings and times when we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| I think that we already had addressed that and I'll let Evity speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| But I think going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| just like with any committee meeting that we have or have had at the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| and the AJ, those are all recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| If they can be live streamed, even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| But I think that's just a given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| I mean, since I've been on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| we always do those meetings and record them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| So I would assume that we would do the superintendent search committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| but we already had addressed that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Do you or Betsy want to speak to what we had in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| talked about as far as the webpage and how we get that information out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| So that is something that's already been addressed and something I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| talked to Carly about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| We didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| we have not moved forward with any decision because we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| that the board agrees with what we're about to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| because once we vote next week, this is the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| And so we want to make sure if there's any suggestions, input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| whatever may be is done within this week to next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| because once we vote on the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| the online survey goes up on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| And so there's no changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| And so that is why it's been kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| if people feel like it's only been connected to the board and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| committee, then that, then I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| But it's for us to kind of get our ducks in the row before we go public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| and have to get ducks in the row there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| So we were trying to make sure everything is a clean is a need as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| possible before we go live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| But that is something that Carly and I have talked about is creating a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| landing page on Knox County schools webpage and uploading the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| And I don't, don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| I don't think I'm not saying that is the feeling of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| And I understand why we haven't acted on it yet because the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| hasn't approved something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| I didn't see that as a discussion point in this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| And so that's why I brought it up to say, can we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| can we elevate that aspect of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| And, and I know in this community process, from what I remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| from what Tammy discussed when she came virtually to our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| there's really three questions that get asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| It's kind of the way they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| I don't know that we have to share them right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| but can, at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| can the board be reminded of what the questions will actually be asked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| those community meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Yeah, I can, I think I recall two right now, which is, you have them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| I have them in my notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| One was, what's going well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| What, you got a bad team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| We need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| I have this written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| What's going well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| What are the problems and challenges and personal characteristics you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| like to see in a superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| And those are the three questions that every group will be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| And every, and she was pretty adamant about that as the topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| and that's where we're going to stay on, focus on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| And she really emphasized the importance of making sure we as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| understand our ultimate goal is to find a superintendent before Bob leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| And if we as a board can stay as focused on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| that will help us be in a position to have huge success when we give our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| offer and then when we start with a new superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| I'm just, I appreciate your patience with all the questions too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| Just want to make sure I'm caught up with the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| This is a quick one and it's really a request of Terry as our board secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| I'm looking at these dates and I'm already starting to put them on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| but like that, if we could get a list of where we need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| because like that interview date already, I was like, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| I want to put that on my calendar because I feel like we've got to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| So I'm sure we have to wait till we vote on this next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| But if we could get a list of all these things that we really need to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| part in, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Just that I go ahead and get it on my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| I was going to say if there's not a problem with the law department or with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| Terry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| I don't see why she couldn't send out these dates or as a temporary thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| of where the board members fit into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| And it wouldn't keep us from changing it or voting on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| So to just pencil a man on your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3731)|
| 1:02:26| And we tried our hardest to make sure we did it on like the meeting times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| with Tammy and stuff or during board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| But the only ones that it's really are that 15 through 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| So any more discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3762)|
| 1:02:50| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| I've been looking at the dates really closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| And I'm concerned that the time that we have for input seems really short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3777)|
| 1:03:07| Is it possible to push that out a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| I'm looking from the time we first have community meetings, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| from now really until December 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| I don't feel like that's very much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| Well, I don't feel like that's a lot of time for the community to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Well, keep in mind that that survey's going out on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| So the process starts the day after we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| So I think there's more time than we realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3827)|
| 1:03:58| Well, she says she's going to close the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| So she's coming to report on the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| The survey will close on the 5th, December 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| And she says she needed time for her team to collect the data to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| to report on the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Now, board members, the conversation between the 8th and the February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| that was for us, that's the reason why it's closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| because we have to get the brochure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| We have to get the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Like, once we vote on the criteria, then you have to start marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| And so that's giving you from December 8th to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| so that's giving you two months to recruit the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| And so if we push it out a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| then we either lose a month on recruiting or we lose a month on making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| the offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| So I'm not opposed to it, but it's the pros and cons of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| I definitely see your concern, Ms. Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| but my concern is that if we go past December 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| I think people start to check out because of Christmas coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| I just don't think we're going to get the kind of participation that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| would want if we, if we, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| I think you'd have to move it to January, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| because I just think if you get much later into December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| I don't think you're going to get the kind of participation that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| So I would rather really try to hit it hard and make sure people know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| that's coming, which we can start doing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| as soon as we vote on it, because that just concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| I just, you know, human nature is when mamas have a lot to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| they just check out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| I mean, you just can't do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| So that would be my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| So we'll just to make sure we publicize it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| On the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| has there been discussion about also at least putting that out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Spanish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| So we can do, we can do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| I know we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Is TSBA comfortable analyzing it from a Spanish survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| That was not asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| I think that'd be a good question for TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| if they can handle that side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| or we're going to have to translate results and things like that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| push it out in Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| And then the other thing that I would just advocate for is for us to go all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| out in the communications about the opportunities, you know, social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| Bob's message, at least twice, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| just hammer it home as much as we can over that period of time to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| people know the opportunities. You know, we are, in some ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| we're limiting it to one day of meetings and a survey, which is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| but I think because we have so few opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| it's even more incumbent upon us to continue to let the community know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| hey, here's your opportunity. There's not going to be another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| Don't miss out. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| I would just push strongly for us to keep that message out there during that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Yes, that'll be our role for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| And that's where the community partners that we're hoping will tap in with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| to continue. So my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| our goal as the chair is to have a cohesive message that we can then just pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| out to our community partners and say, hey, blast this as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| So yes, we're on the one accord there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| But I just want to go back to reiterate, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| we could push it out the survey time, but we're going to, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| we're either going to, something's going to sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| The sacrifice is not having a long time with recruiting candidates or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| giving the offer at a time where the candidates are on a hot market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| So something's going to be sacrificed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| I personally probably get along with Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| I mean, I understand where Ms. Owen's coming from, but honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| you're either going to fill out the survey or you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| And we're going to have three weeks to remind people, send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| I mean, I think if principals can send it out in their parent messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| you know, obviously we've got the employees we want to hear from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| But if there are multiple times that you're sent a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| and you choose not to take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| extending it for another month of continued reminders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| I don't know that there's, I actually think the urgency of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| of a three weeks where we really blast it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| and really make sure hopefully our media partners that come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| seeing some of them here will help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| But really just with, you know, social media, all the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| school messaging and stuff, I really think that we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| And I think people are either going to take the survey or they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4093)|
| 1:08:20| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| It doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| This is just a comment of general nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| that once you get to Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| from Thanksgiving until after the first of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| it's very difficult to get people to focus on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| that they don't have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| There are just too many other things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| So I can live with whatever you all decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| I just want to throw that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Moving on to item I, discussion and possible action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| on Knox County Board of Education Policy C-121,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| Director of Schools Qualifications and Selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Did the committee have something to add on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Yes, this is just to see if there is any conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| from the board members regarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| specifically regarding the requirements for a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| And because the TSBA will need to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| kind of needs to know after this vote who they should be going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| So if you look at the attachment from the job description last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| specifically master's degree in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| preference in doctors, like are there anything on here regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| requirements or the must-haves of superintendent that we need to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| about and make a decision on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| There's requirements that you'll have just because of the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Tennessee, but is there anything that we want to add or take away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| And we can use that last job description as a starting base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| I was understanding that TSBA would be creating those qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| from their meetings with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Is that incorrect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| No, let me clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| So I'm specifically referring to do we want a superintendent with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| doctorate degree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Is that going to be mandatory for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| And because we will need to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| that could be something that come out in the surveys that everybody says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| in the county that this is who we want and that's something we'll adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| But I wanted to give an opportunity for us to go ahead and lift up our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| conversation about that if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| So I guess I had a similar thought when I looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| I was assuming this was here for our information and that we would make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| those final determinations after the survey information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Because I would like to hear from the community and hear all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| feedback really before we, we can discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| but I would really like to hear all that feedback first before we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| put pen to paper on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| And I just want to say it's a board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| So if we do have those specific things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| we need to kind of look at the policy again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| But the policy is pretty vague, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| So I just wanted to bring it to our attention that we do have a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| attached to the qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| So about that policy, lines four through six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| that's just the minimum in state law, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| This is policy C-121.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Is that correct, Garrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| Yes, Mr. Watson, that's, this is pretty basic policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Not much use, really, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| So I guess my point in saying that, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| and I guess that's my point is I don't know that there's anything we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| do to shift policy because rows 10 and 11 kind of allow us to do it based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| upon each search and whenever it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4333)|
| 1:12:22| So last we have item J and I will ask Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| Henderson to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| So as you know, four families sued KCS back on September 1st saying that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| were in violation of the ADA because we did not have a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| During the preliminary hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| KCS attorneys argued that the current virtual program was a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| accommodations for students that have a medical condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| which puts them at an increased risk for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| In his September ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| and I'm referring to pages 34 through 37 of the judge's ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| the judge ruled that in some ways our virtual program does mimic a brick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| and mortar school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| It's set up with an elementary and middle of high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| There are certified teachers teaching approved curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| They use the same textbooks and there's administrative staff as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| their own counselors, but he ruled in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| There are obvious differences from a brick and mortar school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| Students are not physically present in the classroom with their teacher and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| peers. They cannot raise their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| They have to push a button to show a hand raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| They do not have the opportunity to eat lunch with other students to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| PE or engage in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Students in virtual programming must have a caregiver present and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| students have parents that work and they can't provide this and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| still have to enter the building for state testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| The intent of this resolution is to survey parents and guardians of at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| children to find out how many are interested in an enhanced virtual program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| If a mask mandate goes away, once we know how many would be interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| KCS can then develop a plan to be in compliance with the judge's ruling on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| the ADA. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| the two biggest issues with Judge Greer are having a caregiver present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| and this would allow students who choose this option to be at school with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| And it also addresses the problem that they need a space at school for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| as well as give them an opportunity to have recess and lunch with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| peers. Two activities that do not require a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Once the survey is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| KCS staff will be able to plan appropriately to ensure that the virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| program is in full compliance with judges, with the judge's ruling on ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| The program would then be opened up to all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| There will be an equal number of spots for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| for children defined as medically at risk in general education students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| This program will help alleviate the issues Judge Greer has with our virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| program and ensure that we are in full compliance with the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| A little background on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| So any discussion, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| I'm not sure who this is a question for, maybe Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Is it legal for us to have a virtual program that is separate from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| three virtual schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| As I understand, Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| as I understand Ms. Henderson's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| I don't think she's proposing that these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| that these schools be separate from the virtual school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| that these schools are actually, you know, a hybrid, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| part of the virtual school, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| but also connected to the brick and mortar as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| That's, that's my understanding. And, and, you know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| and this is this is something novel that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| that she's, that she's pitching here. And so, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| I can't, I can't say with a hundred percent certainty, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| but certainly that's my understanding of the proposal and she can correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| That's correct. They are not separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| It's just enhancing the current virtual program that the judge is saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| not in ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| So Ms. Henderson, assuming let's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| let's just say that there was interest at every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| Have you looked at what the potential cost would be or how long it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| to set that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| John and I did go over that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| So he may be able to speak a little bit more, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| we're trying to gauge an interest in this. There should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| we talked about there probably won't be that many students that would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| I know many students who fall in this category that are medically fragile and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| are very against doing virtual school or wearing a mask in the school as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| Mr. Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| Thank you. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| So again, I'm probably going to be where Mr. Duke wears on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| I think my understanding of where we are right now and we had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| discussion about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| about that is that this would be looking at our current virtual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| And, and we know that some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| added to that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| we're probably in the neighborhood of 500 kids who are currently enrolled in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| the virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| I think it's been a five to 700 different times around in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| I don't know that exact number off the top of my head right now that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| the three virtual schools. So my understanding, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| if I'm understanding it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| Miss Henderson is that that will be the group that will be asked if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| wanted to come and attend, they would stay on a virtual platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| but they would just be in, in some geographical cottages as you're calling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| To be able to participate in live school to the extent where they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| attending a school, but they still will be on their virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| with their virtual teachers that are in their virtual schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| And that would just allow them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| would allow families an opportunity to come to campus and maybe something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| like a teaching assistant or something in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| Probably the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| the way it made sense to me is back when we went virtual you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| last year that there were some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| some different organizations who were like the muse is one that comes to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| that we're popping up like a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| like a learning pod and that kind of thing was the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| it was the was kind of the concept I got to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| I'm trying to put words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| It's interesting. So if I'm off, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| And so again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| my understanding is that that would be offered to the kids who are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| enrolled in one of our three virtual schools that we would have to then find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| space and things to offer those in some, in some certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| So, you know, your max would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| everybody could could say they wanted to do that and attend school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| And so you're talking about having to accommodate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| nearly 500 kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| but that would be kind of the max on that if we didn't open it back up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| transfers and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| but just offered it to the students who are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| who are currently in virtual school is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| So we're only talking about students in virtual schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| That's, that's my understanding of Ms. Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Ms. Miss Henderson's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| We're currently serving the medically fragile children to see who would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| then open it up kind of a lottery system because there also has to be general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| education students in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| And would that lottery system be only virtual students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| current virtual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| And we could open it up. It's our, and we can do whatever we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| If somebody is currently wearing a mask at school and is uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| they could have this opportunity to go to one of these learning pods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| So we're not talking about just virtual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| It could be. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| we could do either one if you just have virtual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| My concern is if, if we put this out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| it's something that parents are going to assume that we are going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| And then if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| if we end up looking at even one classroom at each school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| assuming that's a portable classroom with a teacher and an assistant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| just one teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| just one teacher, just one assistant and a portable classroom at each school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| we're looking at about $36 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| It wouldn't be a certified teacher. You just have to have a caregiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| It could be a TA. It does not have to be a certified teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| And we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| This proposal is for a survey to gauge interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| If it's astronomical, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| But we have to try at this point, we have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| So we're talking about having medically fragile children in a room with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| certified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| Judge Greer asked for a caregiver be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| And that's what we will be providing them to make this a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| alternative accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4850)|
| 1:21:00| Yeah, I guess I see this creating more problems and solving problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| And maybe I don't fully understand it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| it seems like we've got people that have chosen virtual school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| so they're able to accommodate their children at home if they've chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| So now we're trying to say you've already chosen virtual school because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| obviously you can accommodate it in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| And so what we're going to do is just have a cottage that we're basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| providing the babysitter for to do virtual school. Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| I don't get the benefit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| No, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| So right now our virtual program is not ADA compliant by Judge Greer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| We are trying to bolster the virtual program so that it is ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| Because right now he's saying it is not meeting that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| I guess I'm concerned, and this is probably getting into the lawyer speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| but I feel like we're taking what the judge has said and we're creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4918)|
| 1:22:05| something that we think will comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| We're going to go to a lot of work, and maybe people will be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| Maybe they won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| Hoping this is maybe going to change his mind when I don't really feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| I've seen him go, well, if you create something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| that I think, I feel like this is almost cropping up more ADA issues and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| lawsuits than what we've got going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| And maybe I'm wrong, and maybe I don't understand the legalese behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| Yeah, no, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| So he had five reasons of why our virtual program is an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| and this alleviates those five issues that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| I guess Gary did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| And we could take it to the appellate court as a tool in our toolbox to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| look, the judge had these issues with our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| We fixed these issues, or here is a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| here's a plan to go forward as a tool in our toolbox to go back to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| And do we not, are there other ADA issues that this would raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| or do we feel like this is checking the box of every ADA problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Well, as Ms. Henderson said, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| the judge's order does say these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| and does say that he has problems with ADA accessibility with our virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| So what she says is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| You know, we dispute that in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| So we're saying, and Knox County Schools is saying, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| we do believe our virtual program is effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| But what Ms. Henderson is proposing is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| as I understand it, just a survey to try and find out what's the feasibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| We would not advise the board to send out a survey saying you're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| this because you have no clue if you're going to be able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| what she's proposing is get some kind of numbers and then figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| you know, what this would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| what the cost would be and people and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| So, but, I mean, to her point, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| she is trying to address something the judge has identified in his order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| So that's what we can say at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| But we don't know what this program would look like because Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| Henderson is not specifying what the program would look like until she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| asking for the board to approve this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| And it may or may not go forward is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| It's just to figure out what the numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Mr. Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| Is it fair to say that your primary reason for suggesting this as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| strategy or as a potential opportunity to have the judge lift the mandate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| The judge has had issues with our program and I think it's not in ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| So we need to meet those needs of the judge or have a tool that the lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| can use in court that's board approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| So a major goal of this strategy would be to have the mandate lifted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| That would be one benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| So I'm a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| When I read this ahead of time, I didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| I wasn't thinking about virtual students at all because the Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| Babs point, virtual students have kind of already made their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| And from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| the plaintiffs in this case are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| we're asking for what they were asking for so they could be physically in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| person in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| So I'm, I'm, I don't know who to ask this to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| but it would seem like to me that if this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| if the plaintiffs didn't fill out the survey and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| I'm interested in this, those specific families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| because they're the ones that have brought the case, then I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| to what degree would the judge even care about, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| I guess what I'm saying is we don't have a class action. We don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| you know, hundreds of folks that have brought this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| It's really just three or four. So I don't know. I'm trying to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| if a primary goal is to get it lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| And if the plaintiffs say that's not an option I want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| that makes sense what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| Okay. Thank you, Madam chair. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| No, I don't think the goal is to have the plaintiff say yay or nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| I mean, you know, the judge's order said one issue that was raised in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| court was we have this virtual option and these plaintiffs or whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| else feels like they need to, to, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| not be around people without masks to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| to go to a virtual option. So, so that was raised as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| Well, the judge said, no, I don't, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| I don't approve of your virtual option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| And here's why for those five reasons that Ms. Henderson listed. So what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| what the school system could do with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| if it decided to do such a plan is figure out how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| how you can meet those concerns of the judge for students in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| I'm not talking about, I mean, when you're talking about plaintiffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| it doesn't have to be specifically the plaintiffs, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| but a better option for students in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| So it would seem like the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| then what you would want to do is survey those people, those students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| those parents of those students who are not in virtual school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| who are medically fragile, right? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| I mean, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Wisewick said several times that it would be about virtual students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| but it's, you're correct. Yes. I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| I would like to see students surveyed as well that are in person and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Because what you're basically saying is if a person said, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| I'm interested, I have a medically fragile student and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| and right now we're in in-person school and we're wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| I don't really want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| I'd much rather be in this enhanced virtual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| I'll still be on property. I get a virtual instructor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| but I don't have to be in a mask anymore. Right. That's kind of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| that's what you're kind of listening. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| I'm just trying to provide more choices and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| That's what you're listening for, right? Yes. Yeah. So, so then I guess my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| I guess one of my concerns is whenever people are surveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| I think they naturally assume that there's a possibility of the thing being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| followed through with. And I know Gary's point is we certainly want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| want to survey people and say, we're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| but I think there's also an assumption that you could do it if you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| survey them. So I don't know. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| I think our parents have been, man, they've been jacked around for 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| I mean, would everybody agree with that? At least, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| our parents have been just up and down, back and through, Hey, apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| apply for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| but now we're going to change the rules on you and people who aren't even in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| your life are part of the people changing the rules. Right. And so I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| to me, this feels a little bit more like a yank in the chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| And I'd like to see, I'd like to hear from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| from Bob and his team about what do you all feel about the real possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| of offering something like this? And, and do you think it's viable logistically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| And I know we're not trying to craft it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| but you had to give some thought I would assume to what the logistics might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| May I add to that question and say also the logistics of having the least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5364)|
| 1:29:30| restrictive environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| We, we have spent some time talking about it and let me just say too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| we'll do whatever this board charges us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| So I want to make that real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Ben, we've talked about some challenges with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| I mean, some of those have been, even been talked about, you know, now too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| Well, you know, would the judge lift the mandate? I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| I don't, nobody knows that. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| So if we go through this and we do this, are we still where we are today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| You know, as one speculation, I guess, but we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| we talked about some operational challenges, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| in terms of transportation and, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| We're already short drivers and with routes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| We talked a little bit about some instructional challenges and that being that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| we already can't find teacher assistants for positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| I think we probably have quite a few special education assistant vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| I would say right now. So, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| that would be something we would have to try to do is fill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| fill these positions when we're already not filling positions, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| that we have. So that, that's another challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| And, you know, again, my feeling was, and we'll survey the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| but I didn't want to, and it would have to be the feasibility of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| because I don't want people to think that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| just because you get the survey, this is going to happen, because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| I don't know, I don't know from a cost standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| from a resource standpoint, human resource standpoint, we could deliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| I mean, that would be something we would just have to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| a process we would have to go through to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| And Ms. Babb mentioned it too, it seems like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| there's a lot more hoops to jump through with this than, you know, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| I mean, that's kind of where we are. I don't know if Russ or John, you know, Scott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| y'all want to elaborate a little bit more if I've missed points that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5488)|
| 1:31:36| I think you hit my point that I was concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| but I want to get a little more specific if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| I'm concerned about being able to provide transportation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| not just for this program, because it would be an add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| but I'm concerned about being able to provide transportation tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| And I can tell you that right now on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| we're running what we call between a 1.5 and 2 percent failure rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| And in our terminology, the way we measure that is we consider it a failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| if a bus route is running 15 minutes longer than it is scheduled to run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| or later than it is scheduled to run. So that's the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| And what's driving a lot of that is that today we're short 35 drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5544)|
| 1:32:32| We're testing 11 new drivers this week, but that won't fix the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| and it probably won't come close to fixing the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| So that's my challenge with buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| Facility-wise, as we have talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| these folks would need to be more or less in a self-contained, separate facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| We don't have a lot of places that align with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| We've talked about using portables or locating it at places where there are portables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| The problem is there's not much in the way of portable stock that's available and suitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| because if we've got a portable someplace, it's because we need a portable someplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| and it's generally in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| If I had two portables right now, I'd move them to Hardin Valley Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| as opposed to waiting until February for two we've ordered to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| So that's really a significant challenge for us on the operational side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5608)|
| 1:33:35| I do am concerned about surveying folks on something that we're not 100% sure we can implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5615)|
| 1:33:47| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| I guess my feelings are that even having listened to what Russ said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5630)|
| 1:34:02| even if we had the resources and could meet all five of the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5642)|
| 1:34:11| that the judge has set forth or objected to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| there's no guarantee whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| He is a federal judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5662)|

| 1:34:27| And he can do whatever he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| And there's nothing that anybody can do about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| unless he commits some heinous crime or something, which he's not going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5674)|
| 1:34:42| So, I mean, we might be just wasting our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| I mean, it's good that we are trying to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| but I'm not sure what impact with the judge it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5695)|
| 1:35:07| I just wonder what impact if this type of case had occurred in Greene County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5707)|
| 1:35:16| what kind of ruling he would come down with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| You would think he would come down with the same thing, but you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| It might be hard to get out and go to dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| It might even be hard to go to church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| Ms. Bounds, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| Okay. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| Rush, you just talked about the relative feasibility of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| If you had to, just you right now, put that on a scale of zero to 100 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| I mean, what's your comfort level in terms of feasibility of actually making this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5752)|
| 1:36:01| I'd say the feasibility is directly aligned to the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| that would decide they wanted to avail themselves of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| If you had one person, we could probably figure out a way to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| It gets exponentially more difficult as the interest goes up from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5773)|
| 1:36:21| You're asking me to quantify something that I don't have a specific number on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| but I can tell you that it will get exponentially more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| the more people that you are committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| I mean, I think all of us on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| we've expressed lots of times over the last month and a half or two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| or however long it's been that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| there's certainly things in Judge Greer's order that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| I think all of us to a point are really frustrated with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| I know I'd hate that in the order there was nothing that talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| environmental reprieve from the mandate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| There's nothing in it that says when the environmental conditions change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| we can lift this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| And I think there's some really big challenges with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| And so I appreciate any board member who's trying to work through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| challenges and provide an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| I just think that this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| I don't know that we're going to get a win out of this is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| I don't, and again, I appreciate the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| I just, I think there's, it's an extremely heavy lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| I think depending on the number of students that you have and maybe an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| impossible lift. And again, I feel like we just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| we unintentionally and other people have helped us have done it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| Our families have just been jerked around a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| And I think this is one more thing that we potentially throw out and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| causes confusion and people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| we start getting Facebook messages about, Oh, you got to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| And you know, that's going to, the judge is going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| he's got to change his mind now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| Like we're going to get those messages and that's not your intent to stir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| that up, but that's going to stir as soon as we say survey go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| I mean, that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| Thank you, Madam chair. I just think that right now we have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| And if we do a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| which costs nothing and we message it to say, Hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| this may be something that is not feasible, but we are trying again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| a survey that doesn't take a lot of time to put together and cost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| It could be 25 kids who are interested in this. That's doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| If it's 2,500 kids, no, that's not doable. Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| But I think that the timing of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| we're looking at the earliest into the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| And if it goes to trial, we're looking at years of our kids in mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| And it's worth trying something because right now we literally have nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| and we are all getting messages from parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| Our parents' choices have been taken away from them. What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| What's next that's going to be taken away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| And so I'm coming with something and trying to think outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| outside of the box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| trying to be creative and come up with something that we can give these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| Thank you, Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Thank you, Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| I'm not sure how I feel about this right now, but I just want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| I appreciate you thinking outside the box and I appreciate you bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| something to the board that could, that answers those five questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| And so, so anyway, I, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| I'm not sure how I feel about it because I, I, I definitely, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| I'm very concerned about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| the issues about spacing and where we'd put these people and staffing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| all of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| Those are definitely legitimate questions that we definitely would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| consider, but I just appreciate you thinking outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=5992)|
| 1:40:03| So any more discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| Okay. So we will move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you, Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| We have two people signed up for public form starting with our first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| Mr. Lance McCoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| If you can state your name and County residents and you'll have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| I'm Lance McCold, Knox County, Madam chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| members of the board. Thank you for letting me speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| I want to talk to you about the superintendent search tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| I believe the proposed schedule is too hasty for a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| This important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| The selection does not need to be made by mid March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| I appreciate the concern about maybe competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| people getting hired out from under us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| I have a hard time crediting that it's not like we're a little tiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| district somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| We're a big district that pays a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| And I think that people that want to come here are people who are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| if they know they're in the running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| they're going to stay around to find out, but whatever it is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| whoever we select is going to have to complete their contract probably in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| June. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| we aren't going to be able to get them here very early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| but basically I want to say, let's not act in haste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| The TSBA approach for searching for super ended nationally is inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| The KCR KCS human racist sources department did a great job getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| doing a national search for a security chief. And as a result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| we now have an excellent security chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| The superintendent to serve the search deserves no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| TSBA is not doing an aggressive national search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| We deserve better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| The proposed schedule limits public input on the characteristics of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| superintendent to a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| which most people ignore and a mere hour one day, December 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| that will be in key inconvenient for almost everybody in the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6123)|
| 1:42:09| before preparing the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| Knox County schools should host no fewer than four public meetings in places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| that are relatively convenient, especially to the more remote parts of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| The serpent superintendent search criteria and the final selection are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| most important decisions of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| And I urge you to do a more thorough public involvement process before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| selecting the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| I will say people don't just automatically have these ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| There has to be sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| you have to prime people with discussion about what is and what isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| And a one day thing is not a sufficient prime to get good input from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| Finally, I'll say that this is the most important single decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| Most of you will make for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| I urge you to act with the same careful deliberation that such a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| deserves. If you act in haste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| the community and our children will repent at leisure. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6186)|
| 1:43:13| Thank you. Next we have Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| If you can state your name and County of residence and you have three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| Hi, Kim credits Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| I'd like to speak about the 2021 LEA compliance report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| but first I would like to clarify my understanding of a few things that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| said here regarding the learning cottage proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| This is a class action lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| By definition, you don't name everybody. You just have to name a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| have a few named representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| It affects every single school and not just the schools of the four plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| It applies to every child in every school with these qualifying categories of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| disabilities. So that's hundreds of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| So I'm, I believe I'm correct on this and I hope that helps clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| One more comment on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| and I do appreciate you thinking outside the box because I would have loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| something like that for students who need aid support so that they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| I appreciate that. I truly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| But I will say to maybe clarify my understanding is that the ADA does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| allow segregation based on disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| You can't put the kids with disabilities in a separate school like those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| need a nurse or those with common medical conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| And as Ms. Babs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| I certainly don't want to see another lawsuit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| Now with my last remaining time on your 2021 LEA compliance report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| there's a box check that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| I certify that the LEA is in compliance with all federal and state education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| laws and SBE rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| I disagree and I disagree with trying to work with the school for the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6293)|
| 1:45:01| system for all these years. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| we did not meet our inclusion target for the last reporting data period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| 2019, 2020. So that was not affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| That snapshot was back before the pandemic hit and we have never met our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| target in this area. So we've, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| if we're in compliance, then why aren't we meeting our target?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| And I can say personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| and my friend Tiffany said it best last night when we were talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| funding formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| she said Knox County is choosing litigation over education because KCS has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| calculated that very few people even know their students' rights and even fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| will file for a due process hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| So that's the wrong kind of funding formula in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| where money is going to attorneys instead of instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| So I would just like to say that I'm, I'm speaking this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| So you have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| I'd be happy to send you any and everything having to do with information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| about this, but I, I believe you all need a corrective action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| That's another box you can check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| And I would really like you to ask the right questions of the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6367)|
| 1:46:13| about how much money we're spending, how many settlements they've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| they've agreed to what cases they're appealing. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| Thank you. And Madam Chair, that concludes public fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| So moving on to board forum, we'll start with our student rep, Mr. Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6388)|
| 1:46:34| Thank you, Madam Chair. I guess I just wanted to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| I know that this previous early November 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| we had a lot of college applications due and I know that a lot of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| especially our seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| but in particular are facing a lot of stress with regards to this very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| monumentous decision in their life and it's very monumentous process that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| have to go through. I just hope that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| if there are any seniors out there who are feeling excessive amounts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| pressure due to this process that, you know, they do perhaps talk to friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| counselors, parents, trusted teachers, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| to see if they can hopefully alleviate some of that pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| Also related to that, you know, college can be very expensive as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| And I just want to remind all of our students out there that there are many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| many scholarship opportunities out there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| There are scholarships that provide aid that it's based on an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| process that you may have to write essays and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| but keep an eye on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| And I also know that a lot of colleges have their own financial need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| assessments that many students miss out on simply because they do not see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| They don't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| So I would also encourage all of our seniors to look into that and see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| the schools that they're applying to have the specific financial need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| applications that they have to receive from those seniors in order for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| receive the aid that they need in their college education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| I just want to let the administration know that I appreciate the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| Fulton has had this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| And their administration is also very appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| I just wanted to lift up a couple of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| a couple related to Bearden High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| mainly because I'm just so crazy impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| I couldn't imagine doing this in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| But I'm sure many of you saw the article about Lydia who got a perfect ACT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| and SAT score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| I mean, that's just insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| So shout out to her and her family and the long journey that she's had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| through school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| And also the Bearden High School ladies won state undefeated this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| But then I also wanted to elevate, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| that I really appreciate the school system taking the efforts to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| and especially Chief Pierriard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| I know he's been influential in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| to developing a listening process for the community around school safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| and MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| and then also the shifts that we're trying to make to get more community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| engagement around the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| I mean, more and more and more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| I think the ways in which we can gain the interest and the input of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| community, the better we're going to be off for it as a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| no matter what the topic is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| So I appreciate the efforts made in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| I'm going to give a quick plug while I'm here for something I'm involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| which talks to college affordability is the Tennessee achieves program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| They are looking desperately for more mentors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| We need them in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| I have been doing it for about 10 years and it's a very low commitment way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| to really help our students that are trying to go to community college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| So please go to Tennessee achieves website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| If you're interested in mentoring this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| Thank you, Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| I would like to congratulate a fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| get 16 national merit semifinalists of which Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6577)|

| 1:49:47| I feel compelled to say a word about parents speaking to school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| And as most of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| the national school board association recently sent a letter to president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6593)|

| 1:50:01| First,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| I want to be sure that our community knows that Tennessee school boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6602)|

| 1:50:08| I am currently an at-large member of TSBA and we voted unanimously in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6608)|

| 1:50:15| As noted in the recent TSBA press release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| rather than focusing on educational issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| TSBA has become an advocate for issues that divide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| Second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| I want to express my full confidence that if we have some issue of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6627)|

| 1:50:43| would likely not need assistance from the federal government or the FBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| And so I'm thankful that we have law enforcement in our community that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| quite capable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6651)|

| 1:51:44| right and a duty to be actively engaged in the educational process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-211103?start=6704)|
