| 0:18:16| Mr. Gwinn, so we'll remove item 26 from the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| and it'll be on the regular agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1100)|

| 0:19:09| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1149)|

| 0:19:48| deny the sector plan amendment to office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1191)|

| 0:19:55| for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| The second and third motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| will be on the one-year plan amendment and rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1204)|

| 0:20:43| Staff recommendation on the one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| is to deny the one-year plan amendment to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| The office classification does not meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| any of the requirements for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| The third motion is to deny office rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| because it does not meet all the requirements for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1264)|

| 0:21:08| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Applicant, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Would you like to opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Mr. Klein, please come up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| You have five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| My name is Wayne Klein, 617 Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Knoxville, Tennessee 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| I represent the Westland West Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| and today I'm also speaking on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| because you all asked us to designate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| I'm speaking on behalf of the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| adjacent to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Jack Woodall and Sharon Boyce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| as well as the folks in Traymore Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| Most important to this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| is the applicant's continued and multiple attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| to push the boundaries of his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| to meet his commercial financial goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| all to the detriment of the residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| that are around this area off of Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| This is the fifth rezoning request from this applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| but in March of 2019, I came before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| on behalf of the same constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| some of you weren't here at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| and all agreed that the front part of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| could be rezoned to a C4 or a CH1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| C4 commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| and it was rezoned with a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| and zoning changes and a one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| but that would be the limit of non-residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| back toward the homes south of Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| In other words, that recent rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| which we all agreed on, and the MPC agreed on it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| the rezoning to commercial on the front of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| provides a commercial zone that can be used by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| but we also agreed in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| that there should be a line of separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| between the commercial zones at the Pellissippi Interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| and the residential land use in the residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| along the south side of Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| and our sector and one-year plan reflect that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| Dr. Turner's property has nothing to do with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| Dr. Turner accesses his property from Bluegrass Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| and he has to traverse Moorfield Road back to Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| just to get to the area of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| we're discussing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| His property abuts 67 feet of the applicant's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| and his home is nowhere near this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| In any event, the addition of the requested office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| on this portion of your applicant's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| would extend that boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| that separation between the commercial and the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| which is one reason we acquiesced to the C-4 designation in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| And so if you rezone this part of the back of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| to office, you allow a separate additional use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| a second use beyond that which was granted to your applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| in March of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| And I don't even want to get too far into the weeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| on that additional use, excepting to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| an office development in the back of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| would basically be in a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| It could be used for whatever use the office zone permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| and as you know from your position as a planning commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| rezoning should be based on the entire range of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| allowed within a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| to ensure that any development brought forth at a future time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| will be compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| That's why we have sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| and that's why we have designated zones under our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| And these three requests I'm addressing as a whole, globally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| requesting a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| a one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| and rezoning of the property to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| In order to rezone in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| you have to amend the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| But the sector plan is not going to be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| because the requirements to meet the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| are not met by this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| Presently, the land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| And as I said before, I don't want to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| because I've been told not to by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| but we do have a use for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| because I heard at the agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| is there a use for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Can it be developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Yes, it can because the front part is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| So the question of whether this property can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| for a development is answered yes, it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| But this back one-acre parcel before you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| does not meet any of the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| There's been no change of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| warranting an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| There's been no new roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| no additional utilities introduced in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| There's no obvious or significant error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| or omissions in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| There are no trends in development population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| or traffic that warrant reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| So none of those requirements are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| Office land use has a criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| that also mitigates against this request to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| and it says in the zone for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| it must be located on generally level sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| This criteria is not met by this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| The slopes are greater than 15%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| and are protected by the HP overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| and there are two streams that have slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| that are not protected by the HP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| but they are stream lands that probably are in a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| I'm not going to say they are because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| We haven't had the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Mr. Klein, excuse me, but your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| If you could wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| It has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| As well, none of the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| for the one-year plan amendment have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| None of the criteria for the rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| have been met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| and we would request that you deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Thank you, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| Yeah, Madison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| For the record, your name and address, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| and you have up to five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| and we'll give you a little extra because Mr. Klein| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| went over just a slight bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| My name is Robert Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| I live at 1440 Zachary Taylor Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| and as he mentioned, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| the piece of property does back up to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| There's also two other neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| that are not represented here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| the Battelles and the Chariots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| I've spoken with both of those other houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| and they have no issue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| And I've made multiple attempts to contact my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| and after the last attempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| I did get a letter, I guess, from the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| But I've tried to discuss kind of what we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| and what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| is add an extra building back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| I'm an orthodontist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| and in the front due to the blue lines and the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| of where the property's at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| it really constrains the size of building that can be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and we want to be very mindful of the blue stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| the blue lines and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| so not to approach upon those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| So it really limits the size of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| So our plan was to add an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| so I could have extra space for my practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| and this would be a very low volume, low traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| You know, two employees back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| it's not going to cause any harm to the traffic count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| And I'm a neighbor too, so I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| there's nothing we're trying to put back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| and be devious or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| It's just a dental lab and part of my practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| You know, and many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| I kind of asked an attorney about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| but the office space does make a good transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| when you go from commercial to office to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| And let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| And also kind of the precedent has been set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| because there are other dental offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| up and down Westland Drive in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| But that is, I guess, all that I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| Chair will recognize Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Thanks, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| I've mentioned at the general review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| that I was very much a part of the 2019 rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| and that was a rare situation for Mr. Kline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| to come up with an opposing group of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| that actually worked with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| and came up with a compromise to allow an area of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| that's developed over the last 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| to have another corner at an intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| that quite frankly probably needed to get developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| And I remember very distinctly about a long discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| about where that commercial would stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| And I do think that it was wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| and I think that it's even growing more today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| than it was back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| But I think that the rationale was wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| and I think we need to stick with where we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| a couple years ago, and I would not be for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Yes, thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| You know, looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| it is kind of a natural transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| from residential to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| And if this was going to be commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| I mean, an office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| especially a medical office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| it really seems like it would make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| You know, full disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| my family developed those dental buildings down Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| I can't remember how many years ago, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Ten years ago or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Can you not hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Full disclosure, my family developed those dental buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| down Westwood Drive, I think 15, 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| And they've been a great addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| to the local neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I mean, there has not been traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| They fit in very well with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| As I remember, back in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| we were thinking this was going to be self-storage or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| Might be incorrect, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| I think maybe staff has this one wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| and a dental office, what he's proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| would make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Thank you, Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Yeah, I had a question on the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Are you talking about your desire is to build a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| on that side of the creek, or is that just for parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| Ideally, what the architects have come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| is we can fit a 12...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Could you come up to the podium, please, Mr. Turner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Ideally, so we don't approach upon anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| the architects have come up with somewhere between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| a 12- and 1,500-square-foot building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| we can put on that one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| So we're being very mindful of all the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| and environmental...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| The other thing I wanted to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| This is more of a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| because I was on commission when we did this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| and I remember the residents had reached an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| with the parcel that was adjacent to this piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| but just memory-wise, I thought that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| Gosh, what was the guy's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Yeah, okay, it was Dean Smith, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| I didn't think there was a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| on that landowner's part about drawing a line anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| I thought it was a commitment from the Craig Allen piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| that was adjacent to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| Am I wrong on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| So that Dean Smith, when he came...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Because he came through later, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| and I didn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| If he did make that commitment, that's one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| but I thought it was a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| from an adjacent piece to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| that later became the self-storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Yeah, when Dean Smith came before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| he came with a commercial request for self-storage back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| and the commission and all of us all agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| that he could have the front part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| but we would not invade the residential nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| of the back part, which is LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| And so that was an agreement by everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| the commission, Mr. Smith, and my people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| and we did it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| I appreciate very much what Mr. Kline is presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| I was not a commissioner during that 2019 time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| so I thank you for bringing up some of that history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| because that does influence how I feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| I was concerned about the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| being able to be used in some capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| because the history of the file does show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| that there have been requests on multiple occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| and I didn't read those as anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| other than someone trying to figure out a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| to make this property as useful as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| and there seemed to be a quick succession of denials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| But hearing that there was an agreement and a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| which is even better, that's very compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| The second thing I want to say is that while I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| that the usage that is being suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| would be totally appropriate and not cause problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| This is a zoning that would be not just for this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| but for someone else that could use the property later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| so I think we do need to consider that as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| that it's not just this usage but what might come after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| I'd also like to point out that the blue line stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| really forms a definite boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| between the low-density residential and the commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| and I personally believe that staff's recommendation is on spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| Commissioner Graf, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| At the agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| Mr. Klein just now brought up the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| that a use was proposed for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| that it's not just locked out and gone forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| that there is no use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| If that happened, I missed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| and I would like to know what use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| It can be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| It's certainly not going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| nobody's going to go build a house back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| You know that, although the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| may be low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| nobody's going to go build a house on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| So what was the use that was brought up at the agenda review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2228)|
| 0:37:16| Commissioner, who are you directing that question to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| Well, nobody seems to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Maybe Mr. Klein does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Well, I think Ms. Poitier addressed you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| and the use is the commercial use up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| The use is that part of this entire piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| that has been zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| It's a C4 arterial highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| and you can use that property for anything that that zone allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| and that is the most liberal zone there is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| Is it large enough to use for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I'm sorry, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| I mean, it's a long, narrow piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Well, that's the whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Once this body invades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| that low-density residential district further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| it sets up precedent for the next person down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| who comes in to push back into that residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| and I think, I mean, you can ask your planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| I think Ms. Poitier is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| and I don't want to speak for you, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| but I think what she's saying is the line that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| where that property ends, which we all talked about in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| is where this should stop, is where the commercial should stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| If that stops there, then what starts there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| I was going to say the question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| what's the use for this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| not the piece of property that's already zoned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| What can this property be used for if we deny this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2339)|
| 0:39:09| Ms. Poitier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Yeah, I think one of the questions before you is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| do you think it's appropriate for this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| to have more than one use on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Because once you have one use on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| the property is used, you've got viable use of your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| So if you were going to leave it agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| then it could be used for any of the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| that are allowed in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| It's residential, and there's a few other uses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| I can open the use matrix if you'd like a list of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| but there are a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Well, I understand there's a bunch of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| that can be used under agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| but does that make sense for this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| based on where it is and what it's doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| I mean, even under, like Mr. Graff said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| nobody's going to build a house, I wouldn't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| So I guess that would be my question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| This person that owns this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| basically are we saying the property is basically useless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| it's going to stay a piece of property otherwise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| That's all I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| There's properties that are located that far from Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| that are adjacent that likewise have narrow frontages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| so it would be just as appropriate for there to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| a house on this one as there is a house next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| So it's just whoever wants to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| and how they want to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| I have a question for the applicant, Dr. Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| I know that you'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| it sounds like you want to open a lab on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| Would you be able to do it on the current piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| that's currently zoned CH1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| Well, you know, what we ran into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| was some size constraints with that original building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| And all this has been very preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| We were using Michael Brady's group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| But even though that commercial space is over two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| the largest space that they were able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| was a 5,000 square foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| And again, that was being very mindful of the blue streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| and the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| So our plan was to potentially have an extra area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| where we could build a small building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| And just to add into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| I had nothing to do with this property in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| I've just come into partnership with Dr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| in the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| so I'm not familiar with anything that happened prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| Is that 5,000 square foot building, is that a one story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| You know, especially when you get medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| it's definitely possible to do multiple levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| but where we need to stay compliant with everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| it kind of gets difficult going up steps and elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Chair recognizes Commissioner Oden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Yeah, I guess what, I'm going to wrap this up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| but it seems like almost every month we have one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| where it's on Mayerville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| And Mayerville Highway was 200 feet back commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| back in the 80s and the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| And somebody wanted to go back another 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| and put a truck yard in, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| And we decided not to do that because it would encroach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| on around the other people, or maybe it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Maybe we said, yeah, that's what you're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| So this is a piece that is just no different than Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| It's got some commercial on it back so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| and then it goes into residential Mayerville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| where it's got commercial and goes back to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| It's just where the zoning line falls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| and that's what we agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| And so I want to make a motion to deny this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| We have a motion by Commissioner Oden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2606)|

| 0:43:30| to deny the sector plan amendment per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2617)|

| 0:45:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2747)|

| 0:47:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2861)|

| 0:48:27| We approve the O office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2907)|

| 0:49:16| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Applicant is S&E Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| Location, east side of Harris Road, northwest side of Babley Road, south of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| Size of tract is 105.98 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2968)|

| 0:49:39| Zoning requested, PR planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2979)|
| 0:49:47| The staff recommendation approved PR zoning with up to three dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with the growth policy plan and the northeast county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=2987)|
| 0:50:00| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| There is in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Applicant, would you like the opposition to go first or would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| I'll defer to the opposition, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Come up to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| If you're representing the area, you have up to five minutes now, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| My name is Richard Ogle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| I live at 4150 Harris Road, about three lots down from the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| I'm here to represent the RIDA Planning Advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| I'm a builder, so I'm pro-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| I believe that reasonable and responsible growth is essential to a thriving economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| However, I'm here to speak against this rezoning because I do not believe it's reasonable or responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3048)|
| 0:50:55| In 2007, this board heard a request to increase the density to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3055)|
| 0:51:03| That request was denied and 2.5 dwelling units per acre was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| Since the 2007 rezoning, the only thing that's really changed in that area is residents have invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3069)|
| 0:51:17| and built properties on, most of them are estate-sized lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| and growth has occurred on out Washington Pike and traffic has increased significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| What's not changed is the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| There's been no change to the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| This property sits atop Webb's Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Washington Pike, Bavely Road, and Millertown Pike all run parallel to Webb's Ridge out towards Coryton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| Harris Road crosses Webb's Ridge from Washington Pike over to Bavely Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| and then on out to Millertown and Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| Link Road also crosses from Washington Pike to Bavely Road up and over the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| That's the key part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Bavely Road is a narrow road with blind hills and no shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| The west end of Bavely Road ends up at Washington Pike about 250 feet from Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| which is an intersection that most residents of the area do their best to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| because it's difficult to turn left because of the traffic on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| If the Washington Pike improvement or widening ever happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| turning left will be even more difficult because you'll be turning across a wider road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Harris Road is steep and winding with blind curves and no shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| In fact, four to six cars a year end up in my front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| and depending on how much trouble or really fun they have getting out of my front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| determines how much work I have to do to repair my front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| In 2003, a school bus overturned on this Harris Road hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| To quote Sheriff Tim Hutchison, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| the hill is very slick and very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| Link Road is the worst of the three roads that run around the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| It is narrow, has no center line and no shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| and has blind curves and hills from one end to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| These roads simply will not support an increase in density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| and fall far below the minimum design requirements set forth in the county major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| An increase in density allowing 420 homes on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| would certainly require improvement to the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| County engineering provided a ballpark estimate of $500 per foot for a 10-foot lane improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| Using this number would cost $5 million to improve Harris Road from Washington Pike to Millertown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| another $5.3 million to improve Babley Road from the development to Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| If we're going to improve Harris, we should improve it all the way over to Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| which would be another $3.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| I know you guys can all do math, but that's about $13.6 million to improve these roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| that would be paid for by the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| Lastly, stormwater is certainly a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| I hope you got this handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| The low point is the Netherland Heights Spring and the Harris and Babley Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| That intersection is already known for flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| so much so that the road has to be closed from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Increasing the density from 2.5 dwelling units to 4 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| would be a 60% increase in the already improved density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| and a 60% increase in the severity and frequency, or possibly more, of the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| In closing, there has been no change since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| The only change has been growth and flow of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Future improvements to Washington Pike does not constitute a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| On behalf of the more than 80 members that met at our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| I respectfully request that you deny this increase in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| Thank you, Mr. Ogle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| As staff noted, staff made a recommendation for this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| to increase from 2.5 to 3 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| because it's consistent with the sector plan and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| The applicant in this case has requested 4 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| because it's consistent with the low-density residential sector plan that is in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| and because the growth policy plan expired on its own terms in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| per the ordinance that adopted it back in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| It's been pointed out that the general plan also refers to the rural areas of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| but the general plan was adopted in 2003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| and it incorporated the growth policy plan in its terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| so it incorporated a document that is now expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| So we are still asking for 4 dwelling units an acre on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| Staff outlined the justification for the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| and they will apply whether it is increased from 2.5 to 3 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| or from 2.5 to 4 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| And Ms. Poitier also went through very thoroughly in her slide presentation at the agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| the reasons for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| But this area is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| If we're still looking at the growth policy plan designations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| right across this property to the west from Harris Road is the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| Babelay Road transverses through the rural area across Harris into the urban area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| and I'll agree the road needs widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| It needs widening whether or not we accept this rezoning here today or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| Lots of roads in Knoxville need to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| But that at a rezoning phase is not justification for a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| because once we get to our design aspects of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| we'll have a full traffic impact analysis that will go into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| And from that, there will be recommendations for what the developer is required to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| to improve the roads in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| We know that part of this property is in the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| They'll have to be sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| They'll have to be widening along Harris, Link, and Babelay, at least along our frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| Those are all things that come out of the process once we get past rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| and get into the concept plan and the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| And it's opportunities like this that allow us to take advantage of the growth that we're experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| and to help start to alleviate some of these problems that they already are experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| You know, we hear a lot about, you mentioned flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| which I think is the first I've really heard about flooding being a concern for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| But again, we have stormwater ordinances in place where, as any part of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| no additional water will be coming off this property than is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| That is a requirement that we have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| So these are issues that we can tackle at the use on review and the concept phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| not at the rezoning aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| It sounds like there does need to be some guardrails along Mr. Ogle's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| if people ended up in his yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| But I spoke to Director Snowden yesterday about the concerns about traffic and safety in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| and I think he has looked at some crash data in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| and really did not see this area as being anywhere out of line or concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| than any other place in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| And he could speak more to that and more competently than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| You know, I understand it's a large piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| It might be more palatable if we were taking this in smaller chunks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| But at the same time, we have a relatively flat piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| The hillside protection analysis that was applied to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| looking at what the low-density residential sector plan would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| recommended 4.46, I believe, dwelling units an acre for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| with the hillside protection analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| So there's no hillside protection issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| The traffic issues can be addressed and alleviated as we continue through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| And at the same time here, we're looking at we're in a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| We need to take advantage of pieces of property that can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| There is infrastructure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| This area is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Amazon is coming to the old East Town Mall site a few miles down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| There's a dire need for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| And so we're asking that you approve our request of four dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| or at a minimum approve what staff has recommended to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Mr. Ogle, would you like to make any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| If I may, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Go ahead, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Kevin Murphy, 450 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Very quickly, the growth policy plan, the map, is fully in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| The plan itself is disparate opinions amongst city and county attorneys and town attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| But more importantly, the general plan clearly says that you're limited to three dwelling units an acre in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| and that's fully in effect and something that county zoning ordinance requires land use decisions to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3646)|

| 1:04:22| Applicant is Masana Investments, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Location, northeast side of Brackett Road, north of East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| Track size is 30.03 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| Zoning requested, PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| Density proposed up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| Staff recommendation, approve PR zoning up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| because it is consistent with the sector plan and growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| I see that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| Mr. Davis, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| Would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| My name is Mitchell Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| I represent the people that live on Brackett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| My address is 6631 Brackett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| First of all, I'd like to at least get a 30-day delay in the vote of the proposed rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| so the community can have additional input and questions answered about our safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| With that being said, the community's main concern is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Adding 100 to 150 homes would create upwards of 1,000 car trips a day split between Brackett and Bell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| Brackett Road is very narrow with two blind hills and a 90-degree hairpin turn that two cars cannot pass now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| The intersection of Emory and Brackett is dangerous and deadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| Vehicles turning off Emory onto Brackett and turning off Brackett onto Emory requires facing a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| Add to that, Brackett is so narrow it is difficult to navigate the turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| if another vehicle is at the stop sign on Brackett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| In most instances, the vehicle at the stop sign has to back up to allow the turning vehicle room to enter Brackett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| The intersection of Brackett and Bell Road is dangerous as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| It also involves a blind hill with an awkward turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| Both intersections are accidents waiting to happen and the risk of serious or fatal accident greatly increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| with the increased traffic flow from the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| Major improvements at the intersection of Emory and Bell will need to be made along with widening of Brackett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| to be able to handle the increased car volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Red light will be needed at both Brackett and Emory and Bell and Emory intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| If Brackett were to be widened, it could impact an Indian burial ground along the road north of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| There will need to be archeological studies done to determine the extent of the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| before any road widening can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| Additionally, the subject property lies adjacent to Lambee Branch Creek, which is part of the Beaver Creek watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| During heavy rainfall, Brackett Road already floods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| but the additional runoff from the proposed development could make potential flooding even worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| and the road more dangerous to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| The proposed request for three to five houses per acre does not fit in with other homes on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| All homes on Brackett Road have at least a half acre lot size and most of the property is still farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| It needs to be noted that the adjoining property to the north is on the planning committee agenda for September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| to change it from planned residential back to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| The current owner of the property put it in the green belt a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| but did not realize the zoning did not change with the green belt designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| Without major improvements to Brackett Road, we request the zoning be no more than one to two houses per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| to fit in with the rest of Brackett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Again, we would like to propose a delay in the vote so further safety studies can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| Mr. Davis, name and address please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4055)|

| 1:07:43| I've missed you all. It's been a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Go ahead and have your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Y'all didn't miss me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| Now, I appreciate y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| This is in the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| We've asked for five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| It looks like we would not need more than four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| so I would respectfully request approval at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| Brackett Road, we're doing a traffic impact study on Brackett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| All we're looking at today is whether or not the zoning is appropriate for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| You have multiple parcels around this parcel that are zoned four units an acre or higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| There's parcels that are further out on Emmy Road that are zoned four per acre or higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| There's really no justifiable reason why we couldn't get five units an acre as it being in the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| but I don't need five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| We can't get that density there, so I would respectfully request four units an acre on this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Commissioners, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| Mr. Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| I respectfully approve the zoning at four per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| We have a motion by Commissioner Uten, seconded by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4129)|

| 1:09:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| Next item is agenda item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| This is a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4158)|

| 1:09:40| Present plan designation zoning is RC Rural Commercial, HP Hillside Protection, and A Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| Opposed plan designation zoning is GC General Commercial, HP Hillside Protection, CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4188)|
| 1:09:57| Staff recommendation, deny GC General Commercial and HP Hillside Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| because it is not consistent with the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| On the rezoning, motion is to approve CR Rural Commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| because it is consistent with the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4213)|

| 1:10:29| Rusty Biddle, 10784 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| I thank you guys for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| The parcel of land that you're looking at, I do own the parcels to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| three parcels to the west that are currently zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| As well, I own a 31-acre tract that would be somewhat to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| that is zoned residential that we are developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| The parcel that I'm trying to rezone today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| I bought that with the intention of doing some sort of a residential slash commercial on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4257)|
| 1:11:06| The CA zoning does allow a mix of commercial and a residential type use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| whether it be homes or duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| The zoning that is recommended only allows a residential use on the upper floor of a two-story building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| So that is my issue with the zoning that is recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| Therefore, I would ask, it being a contiguous piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| that I can continue the same zoning of the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| As well, keep in mind, the access for that piece of property is through the existing pieces of land that I own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| We have a frontage cross-access easement that goes across the front of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4301)|
| 1:11:50| Thank you, Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Commissioners, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| Chair, we'll entertain a motion on the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| Commissioner Graf, your light is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Yeah, in looking at that, I was wondering how you were going to access it to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| because it's such a steep, clean, hardened valley road, and the property up there is about eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4333)|
| 1:12:22| It's pretty steep, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| The road that accesses that piece, we are actually pavering it today, so it is being installed at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| and we have currently went to my property line that I just purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| The other thing is, it seems to me we've dealt with this for a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| with this and the property up on top of the hill, the condos and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| It's a big scar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| It doesn't seem to move very fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| We have moved 700,000 yards of dirt in the last six months, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| You might have, but it still just looks bad down there, and now we're adding more to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4376)|
| 1:13:05| Do you plan on doing something with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| I'm not sure if staff took pictures, but instead of clearing the piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| there are some virgin pieces of timber on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| I have cleared around those virgin pieces of timber, and my goal is to work around those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| and work something into the setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| Well, I think rather, I would be more in favor of extending Marshall down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4405)|
| 1:13:36| than going to the rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| Okay, so the CA zone that he is seeking, is it not allowed in the sector plan rural commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4428)|
| 1:13:58| Or is it allowed in that sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| Excuse me, Commissioner, this is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| I'm the staff planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Sorry, I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| The CA that he's seeking is not recommended in the RC rural commercial land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4448)|
| 1:14:16| for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| The CA is only recommended, I believe, in the GC land use designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4457)|
| 1:14:24| and I believe also the RS regional shopping designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| Okay, so the other part of that property that is zone CA, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| all the rest of his property is zone CA, is not compliant with that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| I guess you could say it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| I think it predated the update of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| and previous approvals of the CA zoning there also allowed for extensions of an existing GC designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4490)|
| 1:15:02| that was there in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out, like, how do we fix that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| and how do we properly look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| So it's not complying with what's there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| because the zoning existed prior to the sector plan designation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| You know, I've looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| and my concerns here is that maybe the sector plan is a little out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| When we look at it, we have a school across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| We've got a planned residential development, 4.4 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| This is no longer a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| This is a developing part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| We'll continue to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| Personally, I don't think that the rural commercial is appropriate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4554)|
| 1:16:02| I would personally lean to meeting the applicant's request for general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4562)|
| 1:16:11| Chair will recognize Commissioner Utley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| You stole my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| So I mentioned this again at general review on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| that I think when we come in to either update this sector plan whenever it comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| or we review it when we update the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4587)|
| 1:16:34| it's obvious that this needs to be commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| and it's almost at the confluence of a road that we're all talking about widening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| to get to Ferria because of all the growth that's happened in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| So I would suspect that just other than a formality and just a technicality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| as Commissioner Smith was talking about on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| that rural commercial that is contiguous with it that he's developing under CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| will get changed relatively soon by staff or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| So I want to make a motion that we amend the sector plan to GC general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| We have a motion by Commissioner Utens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| seconded by Commissioner Scott Smith to approve GC general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| and HP hillside protection with the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| Chair will entertain a motion to approve commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| I'd like to make a motion that we approve CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| We have a motion by Commissioner Utens, seconded by Commissioner Scott Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| to approve CA commercial zoning on the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| All in favor of the motion, well, hang on, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| Commissioner Adams, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Thank you, Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Thank you, commissioners, for your time and consideration today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| Next is item number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| We have variances and a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| File 4SC21C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| The subdivision is Nickel Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| The applicant developer is Chris Sharp, urban engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| Location, south side of Nickel Road, east of Flint Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| Approximate acreage is nine acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| Zoning is RN2, single family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| CHP hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| Number of lots, 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| There are five variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| The motion staff recommendation approve variances one through five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| On the concept plan, the staff recommendation approve the concept plan subject to eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| Is the applicant present, Mr. Sharp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| We don't have any signed up presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| Mr. Sharp, you want to go ahead and give us your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| Chris Sharp, 11852 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| I don't have any objection to the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| Chair will recognize Commissioner Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| At the agenda review, I asked about the speed limit on Nickel Road and the Blind Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4796)|
| 1:20:07| And they were supposed to have an answer today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| I don't recall the design speed, but I do know that we analyze site distance based on, I think it's 30 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4813)|
| 1:20:20| And we do meet the minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| It's, I think, 300 feet in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| And we do exceed that both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| I know you do to the right, but I was concerned to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| There's a Blind Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| We will to the left, and it's kind of deceiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| Under current conditions, the slope drops pretty, you know, it drops off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| So, you know, when we construct our subdivision entrance, that will be built up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| So that will help that, you know, with visibility over that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Seeing no other comments, Chair will entertain a motion on the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| Make a motion we approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4858)|

| 1:21:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Seconded by Commissioner Raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| Approve variances one through five per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=4871)|

| 1:25:31| Number of lots, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| There are variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| Two variances requiring, I guess, planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| The motion by staff is postpone the concept plan application until the September 9th, 2021 planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5143)|
| 1:25:52| as recommended by staff for reasons listed below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| Name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| My name is Roddy Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| 150 Major Realms Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| I represent Shod Companies, Expressway 40, and the All 11 Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| which are all property owners on the north side of Kingston Pike right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| I'm not seeing, is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| I'm not seeing any listed signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| Mr. Phillips, you're free to go ahead and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| And thank you, Chairman Phillips and ladies and gentlemen of the commission, for hearing us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5184)|
| 1:26:30| We feel this part of Kingston Pike, north side of Kingston Pike right now, is a hugely underutilized and underdeveloped section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5190)|
| 1:26:38| There is growth all around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| And the commission was good enough to grant us a rezoning on a piece in the city, 10001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| which is right adjacent to what we're speaking of right now, to an office medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| And we've had a great deal of interest in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| and to the point where we're even looking at bringing medical groups that don't currently have any representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| in the greater Knox County area from out of state into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| So this thing is growing and sort of getting some life of its own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| and we respectfully are submitting a concept plan knowing that there's a couple of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| One of the main things that we want to do with this piece of property is bring it into the current time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| Right now, we're about three or four decades behind the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| and we think there's a lot of opportunity there to improve that, to improve the look of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| But in that process, and we've been able to work with county engineering and city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| and come to an agreement on several main issues, but there's just a couple little sticking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5260)|
| 1:27:47| And that's one of the reasons why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| We're not just postponing until September, as we like to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| Those little items that we're talking about or big items that we're talking about are technical issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| and as a property representative, as an owner's representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| unless the commission has an issue with that, I'd like to yield some of my time to two of the gentlemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| that are here with me today, which are Engineer David Harbin, who's the applicant on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| and then we also have a representative from CDM Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| who is the engineering firm that performed the traffic study on Mr. Hollis' love day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| I'm David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| here representing the Schott Companies on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| Interestingly, staff has recommended postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| They've listed two items here to allow us time to further address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| I'll speak to number two first right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| Basically, there is a detention basin right at the entrance there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| and part of the improvements that we've agreed to do on our side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| which is to get in a deceleration lane, to increase the radii of the roads going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5335)|
| 1:29:02| and also to put in the sidewalk along Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| that's on our side of the road right there that we've agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| Well, part of those improvements will take away some of the detention pond at the gym store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| and that's a design plan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| Mr. Phillips is aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| It's pretty much of an eyesore right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| We're going to go in there and improve all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Probably what's going to happen are those detention ponds are going to have to go underground now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| We'll have to put them underground storage, and we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| We can handle all that during the design plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| I don't think really right now at the concept time we really need to get into the nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| We're aware of that, and we can take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| The big issues are the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| We've hired Hollis Loveday of CDM Smith to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| He prepared the first traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| Then the city came back and said, why don't you do a functional plan for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| look at the entire intersection, and give us some recommendations there on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| As I've said, the shod companies are more than happy to do all the work on the north side of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| where it gives us some pauses when the city is requesting us to go across the street to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| I won't get into the technical part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| I'll let Hollis get into that about what's appropriate and what works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| I'll turn the rest of the time over to Mr. Loveday. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| Hi. I'm Hollis Loveday with CDM Smith, 1100 Marion Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| We performed the traffic study for this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| and the issue is the monument sign on the south side of Kingston Pike at Capitol Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| The original traffic study said that it would be preferred to take the monument sign away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| and add an extra lane there because you had that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| But we also had the caveat that if the monument sign was expensive to remove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| then you should look at alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| So the second study that we did for our client was to look at those alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| given that that monument sign was going to be fairly expensive to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| And what we found is that you can operate the intersection almost the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| by keeping the monument sign and going to a split-phase operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| with the signal where both side streets operate separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| So in our mind, the monument sign can be retained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| and the intersection can operate at a very good level service with the split-phase operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| Also, the safety issue, we did look at crashes at this intersection for the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| and there are no crashes that involve the monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| In fact, most of the crashes are rear-end crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| probably caused by the traffic on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| So in our minds, the monument sign can be retained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| the intersection can operate at split-phase at a very good level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| The other issue that we discussed in the report was the curb radii, and it's very large right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| And ideally, you would want to shrink that down for pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| to make it shorter to walk across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| But the issue there is the fact there are no other pedestrian facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| on the south side of Kingston Pike, and the lack of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| So you can shrink the curb radii down, but you'd have nothing else there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| So you'd have to have a depression, and a handicapped person would have to wheel into the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| So I'm not sure. I think there needs to be a fresh look at the intersection on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| and look at it from a more systematic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| But anyway, that's the results of our study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you, Mr. Lovely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| Comments from the Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| Mr. Reynolds, do you want to provide some insight from staff on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| Hello there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| I have a question about the traffic study comment about the pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| Sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| Were you speaking of the pedestrian access being necessary on the side where the monument sign is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| or on your property side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| On the south side, so opposite the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| The monument side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| Yeah, the monument side is what I was speaking of, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5618)|
| 1:33:45| And I think what I'm saying about the monument side is if you do some of these improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| there's no connectivity to anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| There's no pedestrian facilities right now on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| So it seems like there needs to be a more systematic look at the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| perhaps looking at sidewalks and other improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| I was following that logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| I'm not sure I agree with it, but I was following the logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| I just wanted to make sure I was understanding the specific locality you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| Mr. Reynolds, do you want to comment on the recommendation by staff to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5665)|
| 1:34:34| The recommendation to postpone is primarily to show the improvements at the Capital Drive intersection on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5674)|
| 1:34:45| The detention ponds are a little bit less of a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| Really, the lot four, which has the existing retail business on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| I was interested in making sure that with the revised detention that the lot can still maintain all of the zoning standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5692)|
| 1:35:01| the proper parking, setbacks, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| This is the first time I recall hearing that they might be going underground with the detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| which obviously makes it a lot easier for them to maintain all their setbacks and parking standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| the drive aisles and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| I can let the city, the city engineering, address this in a bit more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| but my understanding is that the split phasing that they're recommending for the stoplights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| is not something that TDOT or the city would recommend for functionality purposes for, I guess, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5732)|
| 1:35:42| I'll let him go into it because I'm not a traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5742)|
| 1:35:49| I guess the concern with hunting this down the road to a design plan is things might not get caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5749)|
| 1:35:58| or might not get implemented the way they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| Something you've got to remember is their project right now is in the county primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5762)|
| 1:36:07| The roads are in the county. The lots are in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| The intersection is in the city in a TDOT facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| and so is the intersection across the street at Capital Drive is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| So we've got two different jurisdictions happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| The city wants to make sure that this intersection functions properly as their intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| and they don't want to be stuck with Bill either in the end, having to improve that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5790)|
| 1:36:37| But I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5797)|
| 1:36:45| I was just going to say, does city engineering have any other items to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| I think Mike summarized it pretty well. Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| I know that we spoke with the design team back, I think it was on July 13th, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| I believe it was when we spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| We had a conference call there to discuss the traffic study and some of their desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| and also what the city's expectations were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| And I know at that time there was a difference, I guess, of opinion or desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| and I think we talked about even furthering that conversation if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| And we haven't had that conversation except for today, what we're discussing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5844)|
| 1:37:31| We haven't had an opportunity to discuss anything further with the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| but we're open to sit down and discuss other ideas that we think may work and may work for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5856)|
| 1:37:46| Right now, the city and TDOT, we spoke with TDOT, and their desire too is to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5866)|
| 1:37:54| I'll say kind of what their first proposal was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| which was to reconfigure the lanes on the south side of the intersection to remove the monument sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5877)|
| 1:38:05| and to do some improvements there on the radii, add some ADA facilities and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| So that was kind of the expectation that we had and that TDOT had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5891)|
| 1:38:19| I think there were some concerns that TDOT had and our city traffic division also had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| with if those don't occur and going with some of the alternate recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| there was a desire not to do that, at least on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5909)|
| 1:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| Chair recognizes Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| Chairman Phillips, I guess this is more of a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| If this is approved, what does this allow you to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| What would that allow you to do that you couldn't do right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| The approval of this concept plan widens the intersection in the highlighted property above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| The existing building there is a local business, been a very good tenant for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| They will continue to remain. It's a gym store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| What this does do is it gives us another corner lot right there that we've had an extreme amount of interest out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| and additional lots interior to this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| It will also help with the development of 10001 Kingston Pike, which is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5965)|
| 1:39:33| I think initially when we were first looking at 10001 Kingston Pike, we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| hey, that would be a great place to put one big building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| There was a 70,000 square foot pad out there previous that we demoed the old building on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| But what we're finding out is that there's more of a market for smaller buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5988)|
| 1:39:55| for 5,000, 10,000 office subdivision type things, and that's basically where we're getting our interest out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=5995)|
| 1:40:06| I would like to point out, if I may as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| the sign in question on Capitol Drive, best I can tell from historical data, has been there since the mid-90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6011)|
| 1:40:22| And this commission heard Mr. Loveday talk about the crash data from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6022)|
| 1:40:31| It was developed originally in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| It was accepted into county and then annexed at some point in time over into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6034)|
| 1:40:41| It is well-maintained. It is lit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| And four businesses, and some of them in the city and some of them in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| are advertising or have their business names on that sign because they don't have Kingston Pike frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| businesses down Capitol Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| I can't stand up here, and I don't think anybody could stand up here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| yes, the intersection would be better off without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6067)|
| 1:41:14| And that's one of the things that the traffic study highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| We were asked to do a traffic study, which we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| We were asked to follow up that traffic study with a functional plan, which we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| And if I heard right, if I heard somebody say a while ago that now we want to look at that functional plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| and pick and choose the things out of it that fit the city best, I'm not sure if I heard that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6094)|
| 1:41:43| But my point is, is Mr. Loveday stood here and says this intersection can function well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| There are businesses, there are taxpaying businesses that are utilizing that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| It's not an ugly sign. It's a pretty sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| And we can certainly continue to do what we need to do and keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| I haven't reached out to any of those businesses back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| My guess is they wouldn't want it tore down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| Obviously, like I said, it's in the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| Legally, we could go tear that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| But is it the right thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| I think that's up to the commission to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| And that's what we're hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| That's why I've not reached out to those businesses back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| is I'm really relying upon the wisdom of this board to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| yeah, we understand and understand the legitimacy of our argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| We understand what you're saying and what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| We've had testimony saying that it's not a life safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| Very rarely are accidents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| And we can live with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| This is not something that needs to be cut out and removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Yeah, I'm just having a tough time with trying to reconcile around that sign being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6177)|
| 1:43:06| As I recall, that Capitol Drive project across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| it was just a cul-de-sac at one time, and it was five or six lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| similar to what they're talking about on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| And then that road got extended and tied back in with Fox Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| because Fox Road didn't have a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| This one had a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| And so I think the county just had all of them tie that in to utilize the red light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| and get people off of uncontrolled access there at Fox that had kind of an elevated entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6212)|
| 1:43:39| And I think it was more of a life safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| You had backups at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| So that was all decided a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| The city jumped out there and annexed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| And to have somebody else on the north side try to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| and fix something that the county approved and the city annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| I've just got a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| So I don't know how I can make a recommendation to approve the concept plan with item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6244)|
| 1:44:14| Item number two, I definitely could say to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| subject to getting stormwater approval through city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| And I think I could say to make all necessary improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| per traffic impact study on the north side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| I think I could say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| But I'm just making sure I'm not missing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| I've just got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| This is the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| Does this come back to us at some point with a development plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| The only time it would come back to us is one of the uses in the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| our use on review or a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| If there is permitted by right, then we would never say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| It's my understanding that we've got three government entities, city, county, and the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| that are not totally in sync on what to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| Mr. Reynolds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| I can let the county speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| I think they're happy with what they're proposing on the county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| They don't really control the intersection, which is the main issue on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6324)|
| 1:45:32| And I just wanted to point out, so the traffic study says that in order for this intersection to function properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6332)|
| 1:45:45| over time we're going to need a left turn lane basically where that sign is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| And they're saying today, you know, well, maybe we could do a split phase where one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| the north side goes first or the south side goes second or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| But that's not something that TDOT or the city is really interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| The traffic study also doesn't go into such detail as, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| at what point does the intersection on the south side need to be improved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| When all four of these lots are built out, does it need to be improved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6375)|
| 1:46:21| Is it two lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| Is it, you know, 20,000 square feet of some use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| That's when the intersection on the south side needs to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| And I think that that kind of information would be helpful to allow a project to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| and then eventually work towards an improved intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6398)|
| 1:46:46| I don't know if the Planning Commission has the authority to say, city, you can't require them to make these improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| because the traffic study does say that those improvements are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| I think we can condition approvals to require certain kind of improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| but I'm not sure we can tell the city, no, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| Like, you can't require them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| I just wanted to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| I don't think we necessarily have the authority to tell the city, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| you must give them a permit as we'd tell you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| I think they have their own standards that they'll go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| Yeah, thank you, Chair Person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| I guess my only question for the applicant would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| does it sound like you have any immediate plans to do anything right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| One month delay just to get this plan done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| Does it seem like it's – maybe it's probably in the best interest of you, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| to know what you're dealing with if you're planning on such a large development on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6464)|
| 1:47:51| You know, I think Mike's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| There's a lot of people working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| and it would be nice to have everyone on the same page before this proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6475)|
| 1:48:04| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| We do have several people that would like to know what's happening here before they commit to further things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6486)|
| 1:48:16| Would really hate to lose interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| And honestly, on the remainder of the development, everything on the north side of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| we have no issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| We do plan on cleaning up the majority of those comments in what I would consider a design phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6507)|
| 1:48:34| when we can actually look at the engineering, when we can –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| I don't know if you guys can visualize or remember what that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| but when you look at that from Kingston Pike, all you see is riprap in the tension basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| and that's kind of what we're trying to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| I think I actually saw a car underwater during one of the floods a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| one of the big February floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| And it's one of the reasons why we wanted to have the discussion today and not wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| We feel like if we can resolve this one issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| the issue with the things that are happening on the south side, then we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6546)|
| 1:49:13| But it sounds like it's not going to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Is that correct, Mike, that it takes more entities to get together to decide on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| as well as additional study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| I definitely think it would take more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| The city and the applicant working, as well as TDOT working together to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6567)|
| 1:49:33| what portions of the recommendations need to be done at what time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| So the timing is really going to be worked out during the permitting stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6578)|
| 1:49:49| On Tuesday, staff provided the commission with a report by TPO that showed accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6589)|
| 1:49:56| broken down by different factors and roads in the county and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6596)|
| 1:50:03| that were the highest rates of accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| And you look at these roads, and they're four-lane roads, a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| And what's causing the problems are the points of conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| So it's these ingress and egress, ingress and egress out of these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| that's causing all the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| Because technically, these roads can accommodate more volume and safer roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| than what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| So I think we've really got to be cognizant that engineering is an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| and how these are put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| We are not engineers, or I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| I'm not sure we have any on commission who are engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| So I think we need to look at staff's recommendations and get the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| and the county and the state all in sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| That's my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| To agree with you, I'd like to make a motion to postpone the concept plan application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| until the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| So we motion by Commissioner Adams to postpone the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| We have a second by Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6678)|

| 1:51:20| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| We're postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6686)|
| 1:51:35| Next is agenda item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| This was removed off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| This is a subdivision concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| File 8SA21C and 8C21UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| The subdivision is Dorchester Unit 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| The applicant developer is Masada Investments, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| Location, west side of Carpenter Road, north of West Henry Road, east of Yount Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6718)|

| 1:52:08| Zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| Number of lots, nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| Staff recommendation, approve the concept plan subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| Second motion is to approve the development plan for up to nine detached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6744)|
| 1:52:30| on individual lots for Unit 2 of the Dorchester subdivision up to 79 lots total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6750)|
| 1:52:37| subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| Mr. Davis, you are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| There is Mr. Ginn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| Mr. Davis, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| If you would like to go first, you would like Mr. Ginn to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| Mr. Ginn, your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| You have up to five minutes, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| William Ginn, 7550 Napa Valley Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| I represent the 160 citizens of Knox County who are residents of Alicia Bay Area Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6790)|
| 1:53:19| And we are here today to comment on this subdivision and actually to protest increasing the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6799)|
| 1:53:27| However, I realize that's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| I and my neighbors on the backside of this development will not even be able to use our patios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6810)|
| 1:53:37| This proposed development will be on a high embankment, which is almost the height of the eaves of our units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6817)|
| 1:53:45| We brought this up before, but it appears that this has been totally ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| We assume that the builders will probably put up a brick facade building wrapped around plastic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6830)|
| 1:53:59| and the only thing we'll be able to see will be wrapped around plastic because to see the sky, we'll be looking up like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| This is what I call vertical encroachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| I know there are rules involving horizontal encroachment, but I don't know any rules involving vertical encroachment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| and we think something like this should be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| Most of the residents of Alicia Vineyard are retired, and I started to say elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| but we have some here today, so I'll say age-challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| I'm 92 and my wife is 90, and we, along with other residents, consider this to be our last home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6868)|
| 1:54:37| before going to the cemetery or the nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| We were looking for a place that would be quiet and peaceful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| and this will not be the case when this development is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| And this brings me to the subject of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| I'm not an expert on zoning. I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| But I've looked up the definition of zoning, both the legal aspect and from several different dictionaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6894)|
| 1:55:02| and it seems to me that this can be wrapped up in just a few words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| such as similar value, continuity, homogeneity, maintaining property values, and stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| It seems to me this subdivision really does not meet all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6913)|
| 1:55:20| I can't find it, but with the approval of the four additional units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| we might as well forget this zoning aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| We don't know what value homes will be built in this subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| but it seems to us that they will probably be from $250,000 to maybe perhaps $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6934)|
| 1:55:41| The going price of a condominium in Leisure Vineyard Estates right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| and I checked this with our real estate agent yesterday, is $479,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6945)|
| 1:55:52| It seems to me that there's quite a difference in the value of the homes that will be built there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| and the value of our homes in Leisure Vineyard Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| This subdivision was approved probably before many of you were sitting on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6961)|
| 1:56:08| Things have changed drastically since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| Access to the units, property values, and access to a sewer system especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6971)|
| 1:56:19| This is important because we understand, I haven't seen any paperwork on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| but we understand that the developer was approved by the builder of Leisure Vineyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| to hook into our sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Now, we question the legality of this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| and the present sewer in Leisure Vineyard can physically and legally handle the increased volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=6996)|
| 1:56:43| We have nothing in our master deed that covers this, and I've seen no paperwork that covers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| This could lead to a very serious legal problem in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| We recognize that this is the undeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| This is the fourth time that we have appeared before this commission voicing our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7016)|
| 1:57:07| I said at the first time we met that we're not trying to stop Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| He has the right to develop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| He's the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| But it seems to me that the few problems that we've brought up have been totally ignored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| and we think especially that the sewer needs to be looked into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| and we need to do something to mitigate the heights of the buildings that will be behind us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7045)|
| 1:57:33| such as putting up a high fence and preferably some greenery to stop the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7053)|
| 1:57:40| and create a more likable site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7060)|
| 1:57:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Thank you, Mr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| May I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| What we're looking at on the screen, is that what we're talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7077)|
| 1:58:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Well, mine says it's 2.8 acres and nine lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7085)|
| 1:58:16| Only the nine lots in the middle of this development were not previously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7096)|
| 1:58:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| Just so everybody understands, in 2019, the neighborhood was approved for 70 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| and there was an area in the middle of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| which is where the nine lots that we're talking about today are going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| that was labeled future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| So 70 lots, that includes the road system and everything, was previously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7125)|
| 1:58:52| This concept is only for the nine additional lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| All anterior to what was already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| It's around the small cul-de-sac street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| Yeah, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| You get to see me twice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| The adjacent property is Alicia's Vineyard to the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| When Dwight Disney developed that subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| we granted him a slope easement onto our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| and then we also worked with Dwight and paid for the sewer extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| from Alicia's Vineyard onto our property, and the easements all are applicable for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| And like what Mike said, all we're doing is there was one little section in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| that we had a determination as it needed to be a wetlands determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7175)|
| 1:59:43| It was determined to be a farm pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| But when we did that originally, we did not have that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| So all we're doing is adding the cul-de-sac in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| The peripheral has already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| The only thing we're adding is the cul-de-sac section in the middle with those additional lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| And so I would respect for your request approval per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| Comments from Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| The lots around it, have that been developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| And is that where the people live that are complaining?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| No, sir, that has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| We're just in the process of getting ready to clear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| That was previously approved, and that is already approved as a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| The only thing we're adding is the interior lots in the very center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| and the outside peripheral, which has already been approved, which we can develop, as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7232)|
| 2:00:37| as already approved, hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| But then I'm wondering where the gentleman that's opposing this, where do they live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| Just below on the peripheral, Alicia Benridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| which is actually developed out at a higher density per acre than what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7248)|
| 2:00:53| It's the adjacent property just below us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| And that's where we gave Mr. Disney a slope easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| so they would actually have a backyard to come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| If you look, the Alicia Vineyard townhomes have about a 10-foot setback to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7264)|
| 2:01:12| I granted that to Mr. Disney so they would actually be able to create a slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| to create a backyard for their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| They're right up against our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| I think we have a 25-foot peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| I think they have a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| Okay, but none of your property has been developed yet, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| None of your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| We were actually, we'll start developing probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| we'll start clearing here in the next week or so, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| And you're just adding the nine lots right in the center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| To the center section, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| Mr. Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| Can I have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| Are you going to maintain any kind of landscape boundary between your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| and the Napa Valley Way properties there just to kind of help with their concern regarding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7327)|
| 2:02:15| I don't build the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| That's an individual owner's preference, what they want to do with their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| Our backyards will be probably 25 to 30 feet deep, if not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| Theirs are probably 10 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| And, again, we're now being almost punished for allowing them to have their density close to ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7348)|
| 2:02:37| and our setback is further than theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| so we're almost like we're getting punished for allowing them to have a less peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| But is there any trees or anything that you can maintain on that boundary, that 25-foot boundary, that setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7365)|
| 2:02:55| I'll be glad to do exactly what they're willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| And so if they're willing to put in a peripheral buffer back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| I'll be glad to work with the homeowners association and do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| I mean, is this something that we could put in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| We can't condition that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| I may be mistaken, but we've already approved the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| Except for the nine lots on the interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Yeah, this is just to add the additional lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| Thank you, Chairman Philips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7408)|

| 2:03:46| understood that we're not dealing with anything that adjoins their subdivision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| We're dealing with a small section in the center of the previously approved development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| We're only dealing with nine lots here today that is not going to adjoin your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| and I just want to make sure you understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| I can't hear a word he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| He's saying that what we're doing today doesn't affect your property that was already previously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210812?start=7451)|
