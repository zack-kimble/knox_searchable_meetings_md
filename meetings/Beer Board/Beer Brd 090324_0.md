| 0:04:08| Still not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| the hearing was next Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| which would be the last Tuesday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=254)|

| 0:04:22| Had Councilman Holkus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| try to come by and check it out and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| looks like a million bucks but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| I would like to petition to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| the beer license issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| pending the liquor license being presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| to Ms. Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| and hopefully not have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| Yeah, I think we've had this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| a bunch of times and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| I don't feel comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| That's fine. I'm just glad to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Yeah, no, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Again, I'm willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| I'm willing to say if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| you get the beer permit or you get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| ABC license, I'd be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| to go to a special call meeting if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| contact the chair and ask for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| five minutes before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| council meeting if that speeds it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| I don't feel comfortable without having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| permit. When is the next council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| Two weeks. So that would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| second week of April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Councilman Filo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| I just concur with Councilman Becker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| But let me ask, what else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| are you lacking besides...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| The health department's coming Friday, like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| I was thinking next Tuesday, the last Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| of the month, and got my Tuesdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| confused. Well, we meet every other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Tuesday, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| changes. I know. I've got about a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| things going on right now. I'm doing my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| April the 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| is the date. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Holquist? I'm going to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| to move this to a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| call meeting five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| before our regular city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| meeting on April 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| Before we get a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| or something on there, what if he doesn't have it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Well, I guess he won't get his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| permit. I can call him this day and tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| her before that, just so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| doesn't get called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| Councilman Filo? Oh, I'm sorry. That's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| old line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Are we ready to vote? Oh, you want to say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| Yeah, quickly. It's an unrelated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| I noticed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=394)|

| 0:06:44| It is on our records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| and that would be a good thing to have paid off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| when you come back. Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=408)|

| 0:07:10| Our mosque is located at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| 113th Street, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| 191 feet from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| proposed establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| We're filing it. We're just making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| aware that we're in protest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| in regards to section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| 46-4-66A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| that it's within the 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| most of us understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| And going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| the process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| they're going through, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| he gets a liquor license, it's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| understanding that our hands are tied at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| issuing a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| If an establishment has an ABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| then the provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| to which he referred are not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| That's because the ABC permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| has no distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| That's because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| the code says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I think that's probably why the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| It's not that it's trumped by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| It's because our city code says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| it's not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| For us to successfully protest this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| we need to take it up with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Your position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| is that the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| if they get a liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| you have no problem giving a beer license despite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| the 300 feet. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Well, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| the code provides, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| It doesn't have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| with our not having a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| with it. It has to do with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| having no jurisdiction beyond it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| So much of the beer board is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| an administrative function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| All this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| what's missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| we can't deny a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| because we don't like somebody or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| We have to issue things when we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| We run into this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Again, our law doesn't allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| people within 300 feet, and the state trumps that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| I guess we allow them to trump that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| which we might look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| Okay. The motion is to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| to the April 7th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=564)|

| 0:09:34| seven ayes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=574)|

| 0:09:46| Check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| That's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=588)|

| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Uh oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| We'll file that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| We already filed for a January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| and February tax return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| under his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| I so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| I amend the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| And Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| there was a previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Quick Mart at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| location. The current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| owner, is it true, is not to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| beer until this beer permit is released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| The applicant has no authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| to sell beer until the applicant has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| a beer permit. Are you currently selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| beer at your location? Yeah, but we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| under the former owner. You're still under the former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| owner? Yes. Okay. When that ownership changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| over, then you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| stop selling beer until this permit is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| released. Yeah. Just wanted to make sure that was clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| in all this. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| The ayes have it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| They are requesting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| be deferred to the next regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Eight and nine. Move approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| of the deferral as requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| until the April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| beer board meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Second. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| The ayes have it. That's for both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=724)|

| 0:12:08| 1204 North Central Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| was approved at the December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| 16th meeting. We sent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| a registered mail notifying that their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| would elapse and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=736)|

| 0:12:20| is here to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| Yes, could you give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| please? Laura Purvis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| 1204 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| what has happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| I've taken possession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| of the space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| and plan to be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| a month from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| So if I can have an extension for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=768)|

| 0:12:58| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| Finally, as you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| previously considered on several occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| the Happy Holler Diner at 1208| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| North Central was approved subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| to final documentation at the April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| 22nd, 2008 meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| and we've deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| or granted them extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| several times and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| he's here to ask again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=808)|

| 0:13:36| Daniel Shue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| 230 East Oklahoma Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| We should have the final inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| on that tomorrow. It's already called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| We're just lacking the building and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| and there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| little snafu in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| But I got that straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Having it done before this meeting, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| looks like it's going to be tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| That's the last thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| That's it. We got everything up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| And they've actually already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| inspected it. They've already been out there, so it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| kind of an administrative approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Mr. Swanson, we have to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| and get it done tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Well, you don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| give an extension, but if you don't give an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| it will lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| It's up to the beer board to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| decide whether or not they want to grant an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| I'll move to give them an extension to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| I was going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| We have already determined that it's conceivable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| we will have a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| on April 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Would it be appropriate to allow this to be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| They don't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| have to come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| If they get everything done, they don't have to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Because we approved it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Thank you for reminding me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| Cafe 115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| I'd like to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| we move this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| postpone it until the next regularly scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| One of the owners hasn't been in for processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| so it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| According to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| Now it's time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| The gas mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=938)|
| 0:15:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| I'm Dan Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| I'm the attorney for the gas mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| This is Avtar Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Step up here, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Who operates and owns the gas mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Tell them your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| My name is Avtar Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| Address 5724 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| You're here tonight because you've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| 200 sales to miners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| and to present us with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| of how you intend to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| We submitted a letter, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| which should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| everyone should have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| the employee is going to be docked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| some pay, two and a half hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| of pay. He's been advised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| if anything, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| incident like this happens again, he's going to be terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| immediately. He has to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| at his own cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| He has to sign up for that within the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| cash register system that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| when you punch in a beer sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| it asks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| you know, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| tells you to ask for the birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| We're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| contact the cash register manufacturer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| and see if there's a way to program it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| so that you have to punch in a date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| before you can complete a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| And we hope that will take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| of this problem in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| What if it doesn't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Well, if it doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| the employee is going to be fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| What if you try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| punch the date into the cash register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| and the cash register doesn't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Didn't you say you were going to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| get the sale? Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Then there wouldn't be a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| You wouldn't be able to sell it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Oh, I must have misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| I thought you said that you were going to try to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| cash register where you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| type in the date of birth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| and I was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| well, what if that doesn't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| If the date is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| you know, if that date would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| show someone to be 21 years of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| then it would be a no sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| I thought you implied that you were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Maybe I misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Can the cash register do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| That's what we have to contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| the manufacturer about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| And have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| called the manufacturer yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| It's the cash register. We've got a ruby system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| And he didn't do his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| I was in Kentucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| in my other gas station, and he's supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| to punch the ID. If he punched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| that date of birth, it won't let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| him sell beer to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| He didn't do that. He apologized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| He's crying, and I told him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| if you want to stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| you've got to take care of whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| the city...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| When the sale happened on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| what is the date of this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| It was January 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Yes, sir. I was in Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| And I was late, and he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| he was so busy, and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| had a couple of extra hours of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| He was tired, and I said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| whatever. You're not supposed to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| You're supposed to enter the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| You don't know the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| When you press the beer amount, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| press the beer button, it requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| It already requires the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Yes, sir. We spent the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| He apologized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| He told me he'd forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| So your plan on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| to make sure this happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| that you wrote up for us, Mr. Kidd, says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| the store will investigate having the cash register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| and the key programs of the birth date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| must be entered before any alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| sale. It already does that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| It did that when you sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| It's not a very effective plan then, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| I apologize for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| because I wasn't clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| He showed me how this system was supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| to work before I wrote the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| and it was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| clear to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| if you punch in a wrong date or you don't punch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| in the date, there's no sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| My understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| was that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| ask you for the birth date, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| it would still allow you to make a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| It just would not have a record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| of the birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| What Mr. Singh is saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| that, in fact, you do have to punch in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| a date even now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| So I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| to the board for my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| miscommunication on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Spend about over $7,000 in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| cash register just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| check the IDs and to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| you enter your IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| date of birth, for cigarettes and the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| But he's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| a very good job the past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| and I apologize because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| I was in Kentucky, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| I don't know what else I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| tell. I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| a question, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| that it's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| person, apparently, who was cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| both times, both in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| 2007 and 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| And there was somewhere here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| I think I read, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| you were going to have that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| I think you and your brother have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| taken the TASC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| But there was an indication to me that he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| not done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Last time he got a ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| he did that. He didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| He has classes he's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| but this time he's still going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Mr. Dankid is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| let him... So he has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| since this second citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| in January, he's been back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| through the TASC course. No, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| yet. He went through it the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| time on his first violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| as you can probably tell from the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| is not a native English-speaking person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Mr. Umberto. He had to take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| and somebody with him to interpret the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| if that was the problem, but he's going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| to do it again with a different interpreter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| I think my observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| was that between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| January and March, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| had an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| do that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| and it would seem very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| that he do that again. I'm a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| disappointed that two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| months would go by, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| he had not been registered in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| of those classes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| I can tell you that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| police department to get the dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| on that. It was not until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| just a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| days before I wrote the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| because I hadn't been retained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| or advised of this problem, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| I can't speak to what the employee had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| if he had been told to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| I know what I advise my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| and it was take these steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| That's what you need to do, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| It's every Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| He will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| take care next Thursday. If he's not, he will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| gone. No work no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| I mean, for your sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| I give my word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| It just seemed to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| a period of almost two months here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| well, over two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| that he would have had a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| of opportunities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| be reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| This board feels that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| He's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| late for some reason, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| they take only certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| 25 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Next couple of weeks, please give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| and we will bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| ... Something you need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| making a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| I'd like to move to send this vendor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| suspension revocation. I don't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| difference. Second. I don't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| difference between the provisions of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| plan in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| and the plan in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| They're identical, and it's obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| not working. In both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| cases, the individual was carded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| and yet that seemed to make no difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| in terms of the sale to underage, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| feel strongly that this needs to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Councilman Hokos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| I second that, and the reason is I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| with everything Councilman Roddick said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| This employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| who may have a communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| problem linguistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| I don't know what the issue is, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| if he still doesn't speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| I don't know what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| All they're talking about doing this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| is reprimanding him by taking $25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| out of his pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| I don't know whether or not it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| appropriate to fire an employee after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| these kind of violations. Often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| employers do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| This is definitely not the track that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Mr. Singh has taken in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| don't see any adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| measures being taken at all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| address this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| and just a pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| of repetition, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| That's why I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| I don't know why others don't feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| English or lack of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| English language is the issue. It's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| lack of being able to properly read an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| ID and do the math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| to determine whether or not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| person is of age or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Numbers transcend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| languages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| The motion before us is to send them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| a search and revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you. You'll be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| When this goes to a revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| do they review what we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| seeing this tape? Do they review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1556)|

| 0:26:24| violations and to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| us with a plan of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| you intend to do to prevent that from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| I hired a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| manager, sir, and I put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| all the signs extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| planning every employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| I want to hire and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| they take alcohol and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| taste and make sure, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Mr. Nye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| again, I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| significant changes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| the plan between your violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| last October and your violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| less than three months later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| in January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Both plans indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| that all the employees will be educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| I understand that you've hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| a new manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| but I think there needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| You put in cameras, but you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| you're watching the cameras while you're at home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| I don't see how the cameras are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| to help the employees or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| situation at the cash register when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| beer is being sold to underage individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| We have two violations less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| three months apart, and the most recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| one in January of this year, the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| was carded, and yet they were still sold beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I don't read anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| in this remedial plan that convinces me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| that anything is going to change, and that's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| things that come together for me. I'd like to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| from my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| I was leaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| forward to second it, and you didn't make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| I agree. I'm actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| concerned. Apparently the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| cited in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| was the manager, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| So even the manager got it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I trained them very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| well. I told them everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| but he made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| mistake, and I take responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| I'll go ahead and make a motion to send this to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| suspension revocation hearing. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1722)|

| 0:28:52| beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| We have a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090324?start=1734)|
