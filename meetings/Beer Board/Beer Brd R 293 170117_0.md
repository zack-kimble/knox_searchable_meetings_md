| 0:24:18| Is that the same place? Yeah, and it's been addressed. I believe in the esteem. Mr. Seymour is handling that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170117?start=1458)|
| 0:24:30| Thank you, I had to leave the meeting early I think looking at the fines makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170117?start=1470)|

| 0:25:57| Don't know anything first offense. You don't get anything. Well in the county first offense can be $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170117?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| Yeah, I think it's something we should look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170117?start=1564)|
