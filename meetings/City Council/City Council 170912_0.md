| 0:05:45| Finally, I just want to remind everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| that we are now in the general election phase of the city council elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| Every registered voter in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| will get to vote in all five district seats that are up for election this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| And if you're not registered, you still have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| The deadline to register for the general election is October 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| If you haven't registered, you have until October 9th to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| But don't leave it until the last day or even the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| Every early voting in the election will run from October 18th to November 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| and election day is on November 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| You can find information about the elections and the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| on our website at GoVoteKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| We had a good increase in turnout for the primary election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| but we would love to see an even bigger jump for the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| So tell your friends and family and coworkers to get informed and get out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| And as council is well aware, and I'm sure that a number of people in the general public are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| every vote counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| We had a tie for the first time in years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| and I don't think this council wants to go through that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Right, council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| So please get out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| And again, remember that every vote does count on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| So that concludes the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| I have asked Dr. Lyons if he would give us kind of an update on what's happening on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| with our homeless situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| I know a number of us are greatly concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| We've driven by there during the morning hours and during the evening hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| and the trash and everything that's there has really sort of gotten out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| And I went the other evening while our service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| we had five of our service department people that go there in the evening and clean up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| and I think that it's gotten a lot more serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| So Dr. Lyons, if you could give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| Well, what I can tell you is that we are definitely very much aware of the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| and the concern about it and have been meeting internally to find out what options we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| that can help ameliorate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| And we'll be bringing some things to council in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| but not anything final yet, but we are definitely talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=496)|

| 0:08:39| make sure you get your application in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=519)|

| 0:09:53| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=594)|
| 0:10:02| Those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Do we have anyone in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| If you'll state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Bill Terry, 1501 Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| I'm with Knoxville Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=619)|
| 0:10:28| You'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| We, me and other Habitat members met last night with the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=631)|
| 0:10:40| Spent kind of a long two years going back and forth with input from them on changes to plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=640)|
| 0:10:49| We finally came upon agreement of a plan, which I believe was handed out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| Jeff Archer and Kay Grayville, they were there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| Kim Trent was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| And everybody seemed to be in agreement with this home that we need a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=662)|
| 0:11:10| so we can get a building permit and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| The two changes were, if you have the drawing, we added more trim around the windows and exterior doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=676)|
| 0:11:26| to make it fit in more with the historic guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| And the brick columns on the front, we lowered them just trying to get exactly what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=689)|
| 0:11:38| and added more measurements to the drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| They were happy with them last night and agreed that we did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Anyone else speaking in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Arthur Seymour, Jr., if I may, I'd just add two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| Bill, on behalf of Habitat, is the appellant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| This matter was originally approved by the infill committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| It was overturned by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| Habitat and the Lincoln Park Oakwood Association have met, as Mr. Terry explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| We would ask that the appeal be granted with the two revisions Mr. Terry just discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| and include as part of the approval process the revised drawing showing the two changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Speaking against, Deborah Brenneman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| You will come forward and state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| You will have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| I'm Deborah Brenneman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| I live at 423 East Springdale Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| I've lived there nearly eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| As you just heard, this is the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| This is before the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| But the plan that is actually at review here is the plan for which a certificate of appropriateness was granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| MPC reviewed it and affirmed our appeal and found that that plan was not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| The developers filed this appeal asking that the certificate of appropriateness be reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| But what they're actually asking you to do is allow them to substitute new plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| new plans that they showed to us for the very first time last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| If the developer wanted a review of a new proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| the ordinary process would be to submit it to the infill design committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| where it would be subject to public notice, comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| Instead, they filed this appeal, ostensibly to contest MPC's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| affirming our appeal, which showed that there was a mismatch of styles in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| The plan that had been presented, for which a certificate of appropriateness was granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| and which MPC was reviewing, had an 8 over 12 roof on a short pseudo-craftsman-style house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| with prairie-style windows and a federal-style door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| It conflated several architectural styles and resembled none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| That was the basis for our appeal to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| Although the developer is appealing that decision, or purporting to appeal that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| they don't seem to dispute that that plan mixed multiple architectural styles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Instead, the appeal you have in your packet seems to complain mostly about us, the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| So I wanted a chance to publicly respond to some of their claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| First, they claim that we approved their plan in advance, and then reneged on some kind of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| It's true that neighborhood representatives met with them in early April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| and we agreed that a craftsman house at 317 East Springdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| might serve as an appropriate model for an infill property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| But the plan the developer submitted didn't match. It didn't match the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| It had a steeper roof pitch and a lower wall height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| Second, they seem to claim that our objections are continually evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| But our sole objective is to ensure that all new construction in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| whether by this developer or anyone else, conforms to the infill guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Over time, more of us have become familiar with those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| We've sought neighborhood conservation overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| We've taken other steps to protect and preserve our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| We've pointed out to them specific elements that we feel are inconsistent with the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| But the design elements don't exist in isolation. They're part of an entire plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| It's technically irrelevant whether we like every aspect of a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| so long as the overall proposal is consistent with the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| And although we respect the experience and the effort of infill committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| we think they reached the wrong result here by granting that certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| The latest designs from the developer, the ones we saw last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| are easily the best we've seen so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| But we saw them for the first time last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| and we got these designs only after having filed three separate appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| to you last year and twice to NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| On all of those occasions, we objected to obvious deficiencies in their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| We were pressured to announce an opinion on these new designs last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| without having had time to thoughtfully consider them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| But we agreed that with the minor changes you've just heard referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| we didn't see any other obvious inconsistencies with the infill guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| Some of you might think that we're being nitpicky, or failing to compromise, or refusing to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| We think that throughout this whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| we've just been trying to ensure that the infill guidelines be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| I urge the council to deny the developer's appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Direct them to submit their newest drawings as part of a complete application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| to the infill design review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| That committee gets two weeks to review a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| and determine whether it's actually appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| The developer pressured us to agree that these were suitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| approximately one hour after first showing them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I suspect everyone here is eager to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| I suspect everyone's eager to move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| and I don't know whether the council has the authority to order the infill committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| to issue a certificate of appropriateness based on the new drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| But if you're inclined to do that, which is what I think the developer's asking you to do tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| I'd beg you to first look back at the photos of the original houses on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| It's page 68 in your binder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Because the infill guidelines say repeatedly that the original houses on the block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| are the standard by which appropriateness is measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| Even the very best design is inappropriate if it's in the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| Thank you for your time and your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| Councilman Delaboe, if you want to ask that young lady a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Mr. Brennan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| We have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| I don't know whether it's for you or the fellow from Habitat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| but as I understood the record that we had put in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| there was concern that, and I think you used the word conflated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| but they mixed Victorian design features with craftsman-style design features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| And the major difference that struck me was the Victorians had steeper roofs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| and all those kinds of things that were unique to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Of course, the original Victorian house was torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| But here we are with a lot and an outfit that wants to build a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| for someone who needs living quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| It looks like from the drawing that's been stuck in front of us that we've gone craftsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| That means the lower-style roofs, which they said were easier to work on for volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| They were afraid about steep roofs requiring special roofer contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| and out-of-pocket money as opposed to volunteer sweat equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| I understood, and I didn't hear anyone talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| the foundation was supposed to be at least two feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Is that in the plan now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| It just says, Foundation 8x16 Concrete Masonry Units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| Did they concede that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| It's on the side dimension. I believe it's marked as two-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| That was one of the conditions that—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Oh, so I need to learn how to read the drawing. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Okay, so we got the two-foot thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| The windows had to be a one-over-one type panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| and they put trim on it, which seemed to make it more in keeping with the craftsman style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| if I understood what was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| And that was done with the door. Is it the right kind of door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| There was a complaint about the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| The door that is on the current proposal is different than the door that was presented to the annual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| I understand that, and I know that part of your complaint was you were jerked around a few times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| and not getting plans in advance, committee or review group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| not really doing the job, making sure it was complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| And you're trying to restore an old neighborhood and keep the character intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| I guess I'm faced with the question of if we're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| it's sort of, to me, somewhat water under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| If there's something that's left out of this that they should have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| whether it's roof shape, style, whether it's the windows of the door in the front or the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| whether it's the height of the foundation, then maybe we have an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| But if they've finally come around to saying, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| we're going to adjust the Habitat house to be more in keeping with your guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| because ultimately we want to be a part of your community and not a disruptive force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| if we're there, what's wrong with approving it and moving on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| That's the question. I mean, do you want a pound of flesh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| I mean, is this the Merchant of Venice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Or do we now have a concession that gets us to an acceptable style for the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1231)|
| 0:20:41| That's really what I'm asking, the last part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| I don't know if I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| I mean, we've suggested multiple Victorian styles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| and they've insisted that craftsmen is the only thing they would use as a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| So if a craftsman house is what they're going to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| then this does seem to be consistent with the craftsman style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| We would prefer a Victorian house given the composition of other houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| Well, they're more striking in style and shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| And the majority of the houses on this block are Victorians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| The house that was on this site, which they demolished, was a Victorian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| Right. But I'm saying, is that now water under the bridge to some degree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| These guys want to build an affordable house for a not well-to-do family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| but they want to satisfy the neighborhood's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| And are we at a reasonable point where we should, say, move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| I mean, that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| We might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| It seems to me that the developer is trying to circumvent the process here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| by using this appeal only to complain about us and bring you a new proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| instead of subjecting it to the normal review process of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| who have the skill and experience to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| At the moment, no, we don't see any obvious inconsistencies with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| I don't know of anything that we would say has to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| This could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Okay. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| And if you can, Mr. Terry, is it Terry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| Let me interrupt just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| If I understand, you're really talking about process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| and I was going to ask Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| would you chime in on this in terms of what they're referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| that this is really not going through the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| The drawing before you has not gone to the infill housing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| That process calls for the plans to be submitted with an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| The infill housing committee meets after reviewing the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| and discusses the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| and makes a decision as to whether the design is in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| with the infill housing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| My understanding is that the city council does have the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| if they so choose, to issue a certificate of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| or mandate that a certificate of compliance be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| by the infill housing committee based on these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| And I think that is what Ms. Brannon is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| with regard to circumventing the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| It's not, I think, circumventing the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| It's a bit different than the normal process, but it is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| I was going to ask the same question to Ms. Graybill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| who I didn't see hidden over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Do you have anything to add to that, Kay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Could I have him just answer briefly if he has met the criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| I'm a bit confused because we agreed on everything last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| but Kay and Jeff Archer were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| and what we asked for is if there's any changes to the drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| that we gave to them, and they came up with two changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| We made them, redrew the drawing, printed it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| and they said it would be good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Talking to Kay after the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| she said this would go through a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| This would be good for a historic overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| so the house is drawn to proportion and drawn correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| and there are a lot of these type houses in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| There's Victorians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| There's a huge mixture, but this craftsman style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| it's prevalent in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| We have one more person who is going to speak against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| and that's Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| We can't have Dan over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Mark's head is light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Mark's head is light on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Go ahead and let the houseman speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Well, let me ask my quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| I want to ask the question of the young lady that was at the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| You're on Greenville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| I think that was your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| I'm two houses down from the empty lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| I wanted to know how close you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Same side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| There is one house in between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| We do have one more person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Mark, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Yeah, Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| State your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| My name is Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| I live at 428 East Burwell Avenue, and I have for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| We were happy to meet with Habitat members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| and finally meet Mrs. Schultz yesterday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| but I feel that we were pushed into a hasty decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| and were not allowed time to take this back to our committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| on the issue of code zoning and blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Several of those members were unable to attend last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| due to work obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I have served on the board of Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| for more than four years, first as treasurer, now as vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| I have personally attended blight meetings, neighborhood leadership workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| public officer hearings, infill committee meetings, and the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| I have recently attended a Better Building Board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| where we requested city intervention to save endangered properties from demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| We love our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| and our mission as a neighborhood association is to promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| and build a healthy environment for everyone who lives and works in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| That's why we're not surprised that Habitat families are eager to live in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| but we're disappointed that Habitat management seems to show low respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| for our neighborhood or the infill guidelines for the heart of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| As a volunteer nonprofit board, we too are concerned about the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| that go through the training to achieve a Habitat house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| These families do a ton of work to achieve their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| and they deserve good homes to invest in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| not ones that stand out because they're so different from the surrounding historic houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| With Habitat's interest-free loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| a family's monthly mortgage payment would only increase by $14 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| if they increased the purchase price of a house by $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| We share Habitat's concern for providing affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| but badly designed houses that don't blend in with historic blocks are not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| Incompatible and insensitive development is one of the causes of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| Last year, Councilwoman Palmer told us to get organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| in our efforts to protect the historic character of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| so last fall we requested a neighborhood conservation overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| for the oldest portion of the neighborhood, which includes this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| That's on pages 4 and 5 of the packet I submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| Due to lack of staffing and money at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| the implementation of that overlay is not likely to begin until 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| The overlay would ensure even greater design consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| and make it harder for developers to demolish old homes like the one on Springdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| Our neighborhood is experiencing great revitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| but some investors and developers are tearing down old houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| or gutting them of their historic features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| This developer has built at least eight houses in our area where historic houses once stood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| and they demolished the Victorian on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| even after a concerned neighbor offered to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| This build will be the sixth by this builder in our potential overlay area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| See page 5 of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| We have many examples of bad infill in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| some of which were built quite recently, despite the infill guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| I included photographs on pages 1 and 2, and then 6 through 13 of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| Just last year, after we had come before you about this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Habitat proposed plans for a house on an empty lot on Branner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| next to a Victorian with a 12-over-12 roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Their plan was approved, subject to conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| including our request for the 6-over-12 roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| The resulting house has a flat porch without an elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| unlike the original houses nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| and the overall effect of the house has diminished mass and scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| Around the same time, a Habitat representative said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| they did not plan to build in our neighborhood again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Some of us felt relief, not because we have any ill will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| towards the families who live in Habitat houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| but because Habitat's designs have detracted from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| instead of improving, the blocks on which they are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| That ends up hurting the residents of those houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| as well as current and future neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| Yesterday, however, Habitat's president said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| they definitely want the opportunity to continue building here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| We can only hope that future plans will conform to the infill guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| will not involve the destruction of existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| historic homes, and will not require appeals to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| Lastly, in case it sounds like our primary focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| as a neighborhood association is on attempting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| to prevent inappropriate development, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| We are taking steps to make other positive improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| focusing on parks and developing a historic walking trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| to enhance the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| I've included some information about that positive stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| that we are working on in your packet also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| By appealing these infill committee decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| we've been requesting that infill design guides be upheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| for all heart of Knoxville neighborhoods, not just ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Some neighborhoods are less fortunate, less organized, and lower income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| So please deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| And thank you very much for your time and attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| and for reading our packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| I certainly don't feel like they've been nitpicky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| The neighborhood and Habitat have worked together for many months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| if not up to close to two years, I believe, trying to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| And I applaud them for their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| A lot of times the attention is not made to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| But I do think after last night's final meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| that everybody walked away from the meeting agreeing on a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| And so I do feel like they've done everything, gone above and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| to try to work with the neighborhood to that extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| And after last night's meeting felt like everything was okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| with what was being presented with the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| So I'll move that the appeal be granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| and condition upon staff issuing IH1 certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| for the property located at 431 Springdale Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| which is consistent with the revised architectural plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| which have been presented to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| and which have been submitted to the city recorder as part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| And I would like to see other neighborhoods work just as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| together with other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Just one quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I'm still struggling a little bit with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| but it seems like your efforts as a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| has brought Habitat around from probably a fixed position as they walked in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| and you've taken them to task before council several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| You've taken them to task before the infill housing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| But at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| this house is one of the types of houses in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| and it fits in architecturally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| So is there really a need to continue the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| when what ultimately we're trying to do is fill in that lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| It's a shame the Victorian was torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| I agree with what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| But it's down, and the house will go in its place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| and the family will live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| and the community will be knit back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| If they're meeting the conditions for an acceptable craftsman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| I don't know of any reason why we should deny approving the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| not as a vindication of their beating the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| but as a vindication of the process you guys informally came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| to make them change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| And I think you have a victory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| I don't see you not with a win in your win column here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| even if technically we vote for the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Ms. Grable, do you believe this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| or do you feel confident that this would be approved by the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| if you want to come on down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| do you feel confident this would be approved by the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| it would be appropriate under the guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| Yeah, I can't speak as to approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| but I can say that we did look at the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| and the folks present at the meeting from the committee last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Jeff Archer and myself and Kim Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| We looked at the guidelines and found that this does meet the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| because they're not specific about style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| except for that the style has to fit in with the streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| And on that particular street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| we do have a variety of styles and a variety of roof pitches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| And I think the neighborhood acknowledged that, yes, that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| And although we would enjoy seeing a Victorian back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| the fact of the matter is it's not required by the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| All that's required is compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| So I think we do have this craftsman house now designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| so that it is more proportionately similar to other craftsmen on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| I'll support Mr. Campin's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| but I'd just like to commend the neighborhood for really digging in on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| I think guidelines are tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| It takes, obviously you all have put in a lot of hours into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| and there's such potential in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| And I really commend you all for recognizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| and recognizing threats to it of what kind of structures add value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| and what kind do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| I think it's a tremendous neighborhood and has a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| It's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| There's sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| There's trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| It's close to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| It's close to mountain biking trails and Sharps Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| Anyway, so I think you should feel really good about the work you've done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| Thank you, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Mr. Wallace, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Stairman Wallace, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| I guess I want to go back to you, Gerald, and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| I mean, the only thing this lacks is the approval from the infield guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| It lacks that stamp of approval, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| And you're saying that council can supersede that and make that approval ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| or send it back to them for their official stamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| And the infield housing committee would review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| And how many people's on, excuse my ignorance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| but how many people's on that other than those three right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| Jeff Archer is the staff lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| Kate Berryville is on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Emily Dills, representative of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| Gary Childress from East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2147)|
| 0:36:00| I guess that's where my hesitancy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| It's not that I disagree with any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| It's just like, do we want council to be that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| Do you want to set that precedent that you can come here and get it approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| And I'm just not sure you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I don't know what the hurry is to Habitat unless there is some, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| I mean, do we want to be that approval body for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| I have no problems with the design, and I appreciate what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| I'm just not sure that's what, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Isn't that what our charter calls it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| I don't know what the motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Mark, you might want to restate the motion so we understand exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| The motion is to approve the appeal pending the conditions that were agreed upon last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| It's not pending that it goes to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| It's not pending that it goes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Oh, no, it's not that it goes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| That would, I think, I'm trying to remember how long it would push it further down to the meeting and post it for 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2215)|
| 0:37:06| So I think it's maybe another month that they would have to wait to break ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2226)|
| 0:37:14| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| I have several concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| One is that an agreement was made last night, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| But it also, I agree with the neighborhood, that we're circumventing the infill group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| I don't think that's the job of council to do, whether we have the authority to do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| Another concern I have is that, okay, Habitat, we approved the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| They proceed with this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| What's to keep them from coming up with another piece of property in that neighborhood, coming up with some kind of a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| getting it through the infill committee, and then the neighborhood's not comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| And so then they depend on council to once again uphold their appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| So that bothers me very much that that is, as Councilman Wallace says, perhaps setting a precedent that this council should not be setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2278)|
| 0:38:07| I won't be supporting the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| I'm sorry, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| That's my point, and I agree with Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| I think that let's just send it back and let that panel of nine people look at it and support it and then stamp it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2296)|
| 0:38:26| while we're approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| I just can't support it until you – I just don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| I mean, even if Mr. Terry has a strong appeal, I still think that's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| We do have the right to do that, but I'm not sure – I'm not comfortable with making that decision here at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2317)|
| 0:38:44| Mr. Dellavalle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Real quick, that's how our laws are set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| We have bodies that make routine decisions, and when someone's unhappy with them, they come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| and we cut through the mustard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| It hasn't gone through the process real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| It hadn't gone through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| It hadn't gone back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| That's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| It's been through the process three times, and the first time, apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| the infield committee did not even note that the application was incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| They screwed up, and the group was right to bring that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| But we are a body of last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| They come – or the courts, I guess, but we're here to resolve disputes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| and use our judgment on behalf of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| I think we should decide it, put it to rest, get the house built before winter comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| and not make this the war of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| They have reached an agreement that they will build a craftsman house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| You've studied the guidelines, and you know that that house fits it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| I've studied all the complaints and the items that were in the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| They're in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| I don't believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| This plan was approved by an infield committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| We made two changes to it last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| It was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Excuse me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| I'm not taking any position whatsoever in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| but if the appeal is denied or if this plan is sent back to the infield committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2402)|
| 0:40:12| – I just conferred with Mr. Swanson – the review process would begin again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| The potential for the appeal process would begin again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| So, if you send it to the infield design committee, it potentially will not stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2422)|
| 0:40:30| I mean, if some people on council think, well, let's have the non-member committee look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| and if they approve it, that's the end of it, it might not be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| I just want to bring that to council's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| They could appeal it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Would you repeat the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| The motion is to move the appeal be granted, conditioned upon MPC staff issuing an IH1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2449)|
| 0:40:58| certificate of appropriateness for the property located at 431 Springdale Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| which is consistent with the revised architectural plans which have been presented to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| and which have been submitted to the city recorder as part of this record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| So, if you support the neighborhood, or the people here that spoke against it, you would vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2476)|
| 0:41:25| If you approve what Councilman Campin suggests, which is what I believe Habitat supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| you would vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| We'll call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| It's been recommended we do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2515)|

| 0:41:57| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2517)|

| 0:42:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| It fails 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| It fails 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Okay, now we need a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2531)|

| 0:42:17| So we're going to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Council has recommended we do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2538)|

| 0:43:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| So we're going to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| You've got to really watch these lights up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Sorry about that, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Jim, I mean, these guys, apparently we relied on consultants to give us quantities and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2636)|
| 0:44:05| plan to fix the lake, and they missed it by quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| I mean, $250,000 is a lot, and I just wonder what, if there are any measures, and is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| any opportunity for the city to recover part of that fee, or any damages that were made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| Is that part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| I mean, that's a pretty big miss, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| We are exploring our legal options, and Charles is in on this, too, so we are looking at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2669)|
| 0:44:39| we can get back out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| That's a pretty big jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| A 50% increase there, a 100% increase, and it's not that I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| I'm glad you are, and I think you should, and it seems like, you know, at $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| we may have had other options, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| You've answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| How confident are we that this process will fix the lake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| I mean, 100% or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| It is a factor in fixing the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| It won't fix the lake by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| It will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| I mean, there isn't anything short of, well, a lot of water processing that would be guaranteed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2722)|
| 0:45:33| to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| So there's a lot of management that needs to happen to that lake in order to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| So what would be the next steps after this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Well, we're going to continue educating the public about how to feed the ducks in ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2743)|
| 0:45:52| that aren't destructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| What goes in comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Managing populations, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| And there's some other vegetation management that needs to continue happening, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2758)|
| 0:46:09| working with the Lions Club, who's the official owner, but they may need a hand long run in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2769)|
| 0:46:21| making and managing it most effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Any other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| I need some help up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2787)|

| 0:47:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| I just wanted to ask Jim Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| This is a long-term project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| It looks like we're shooting for completion by 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| How long is the greenway that we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| And I know we're by the creek and crossing probably the road and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| I've measured that, and I forget exactly what the distance is, but it's that whole Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| It's basically from Woodlawn down to the existing greenway entrance that comes in, I can't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2868)|
| 0:47:57| of the name of the street there, at the southern end of Broadway Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| So the design here has to take into account the proximity of the creek and the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| property and all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| You can see the section along Fulton High School that's actually being graded, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| They're well along with construction on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| So this would link that section that they're currently building with the existing section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| of greenway that goes on to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| All the way past Emmerlin to the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2913)|

| 0:48:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2916)|

| 0:48:59| It's moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Another light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| Christine, will you comment a little bit about, we've had consultants and plans and ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2943)|
| 0:49:14| about a potential rebuild of the Coliseum and renovation of the Auditorium, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| these parking garages were discussed then about, was this part of that plan, and does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| it fit into that overall plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Should we ever choose, or should we ever get to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Does it kind of fit into that long-term plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| Yeah, so these garages were considered in the feasibility study that was done in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| and then presented in 2016, and it was identified then that there were some issues with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| You guys, as E-Council, approved a budget that included a review, a structural assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| of the garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| We did the structural assessment and the, is this me doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| And it was determined that there were some immediate needs and then some long-term needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| for, to maintain the structural integrity of those garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| So this particular proposal is for design work of the garages, and it would also include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3005)|
| 0:50:16| assistance with construction bidding and the construction administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| So long-term, we're going to be using the garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| The garages are used every day today, quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| The feasibility study indicated that long-term, the arena would need to be, it was the perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| location for a rebuilding of the arena, renovation of the auditorium, so the site's not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| to be changing in any particular way, and I think also you guys are aware that the Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| committed to trying to make that project happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| So there's some part of structural, the structural design in Garage C, for example, that gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| used all the time during football season, especially with RVs, that we actually are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| having to block off right now because it's not structurally sufficient for those RVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| So these are definitely repairs that are needed, and this will probably be the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| phase that you will see, you'll see more phases of this work as we can afford to do it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| our facility reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3070)|

| 0:54:28| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| This looks like it's a well-needed reform of our codes on recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| There's something on page 386, and it's Section 8, or it's Section 20-60, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3274)|
| 0:54:43| Subsection 8 talks about, in essence, no person shall carry firearms, and then it has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| caveat, except as may be authorized by law, and parens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| I assume the state legislature has said, well, they can carry firearms in the park, tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| noogies, but where are we on that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| We're going to follow the state law with regard to carrying firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| That changes from time to time, and we keep track of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| But this particular provision that you're talking about simply expands references to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3312)|
| 0:55:22| no hunting and trapping wildlife, and updates some references to picnics and horses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| are contained in that particular section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| It's really just a housekeeping section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| We will continue to follow the state law with regard to the ability of folks to carry firearms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| on public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3337)|

| 0:56:33| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3393)|
| 0:56:54| Okay, counsel, we have several people who want to talk on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3414)|
| 0:57:15| Can I address one thing first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| I'm getting to you, Mr. Delvopi, once I get finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| So we do have several people that do want to talk, but before that, Counselman Delvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| I just have one addition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Maybe it's in the text, but there had been a series of exchanges on the question of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| is a parking lot or garage adjacent to a residential area, and the question was what about if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3457)|
| 0:57:49| right across the street from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| There was an exchange from, among others, Carlene Malone and Charlotte Davis with Gerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| Green, and he has agreed that they could take out about four words that would, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| if you turn to page 402, location and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| It says, parking lots with common frontage on the same block and on the same side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| the road with residentially zoned property shall be set back 25 feet, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| And the phrase that would be taken out is, and on the same side of the road, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| would delete those words with the understanding, as I gathered from the paperwork that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| going back and forth, that the idea of common frontage is measured from the center of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| road, and if you took that language out, it would address parking lots that either face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3517)|
| 0:58:44| a residential area across the street or are adjacent to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| So I would like to make sure that the motion we have is amended to have that language removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3529)|
| 0:58:57| because it seems like there's no MPC problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I've seen a note from Mr. Swanson saying he doesn't think it's substantial enough and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| has been considered, so that we could take those several words out and then pass it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| first reading with that correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| There's obviously other comments, but that was one I wanted to make sure we had on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| That's not the motion that's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| It's a motion to approve, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| And I'm moving to amend it, and I think, isn't that a priority motion to take out that phrase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3559)|
| 0:59:27| It's not a priority motion, but it's a good motion to make at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| You can go ahead and make it at this point or at any point during the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| You're going to make it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| I would like just to make the motion that we delete that language that I just read in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| Section 8 so that it applies whether the residential area is adjacent, next door to it, or across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| the street from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| That would solve that technical problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3596)|

| 0:59:59| We have a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Just by interest, I mean, we have these motions right here, and I would like to just incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| whatever we're going to incorporate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| Maybe all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| All of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| That's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| We've got the setback in the yellow piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| It's not in the packet, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| No, but it's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Before we vote, though, shall we hear the people that have signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3623)|

| 1:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Speaking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Well, actually, if you've got a motion on the table, you need your debate to be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| to that particular motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| You now have a motion on the table to amend it as Mr. Della Volpe said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| He can either withdraw that motion and allow the debate and then make the motion, or you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| have to limit your debate to what his motion is, which is to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| I'll withdraw it for now so that we can continue the debate and the listening of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| But I wanted to call that to the attention of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Mr. Wallace, will you withdraw your second as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Speaking for, we have Jennifer Roche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3665)|
| 1:01:14| Jennifer, if you will come forward, state your name and address, and you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Jennifer Roche, 609 Wise Garber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I'm here representing the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors and many of our collaborators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| the Knoxville Chamber, CCIM members, architects, Building Owners and Managers Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| First of all, I want to thank Gerald Green, the MPC, for incredible detailed, thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| work on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| I think it's very well crafted and will serve Knoxville well into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| It's forward-looking but also protects small businesses and redevelopment, and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| urge you to pass it as is, especially in regards to many of the requirements in Section J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| I think that, as it's written, it will fit in well with all of the other development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| requirements, as we have now, and will hopefully fit in well with the recode when that's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| I think you've received some examples from Tim Hill on some of the lots, as described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| the 20,000 square feet and the 10,000 square feet size lots that are exempted in Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| J currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I would just like to reiterate that those are many of the size lots that we have along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| our corridors that are really primed for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| So, thank you for your time and urge you to pass it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3753)|
| 1:02:42| Amy Nolan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| I'm going to pass the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| You're going to pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Carleen Malone, if you will state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| You'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| And I should have put my name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| I circulated the language on the yellow sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| This should be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| I'm here on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| We are not asking for changes in the amount of or the nature of the landscaping materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| the size of the bushes, number of trees, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| We are not asking to change the size or location of the interior islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| And we are not asking for the enlargement of any setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| And furthermore, we believe that the changes we are requesting can be approved tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| on first reading without sending the entire document back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| What we are asking for is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| In Section J landscaping, there is a 10-foot perimeter screening area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3829)|
| 1:03:57| between a parking lot and any public right-of-way, any street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| For months, for a year, we reviewed this and assumed that was a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| It's not a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| It is a screening area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| You received answers to questions from Mr. Ahrens, who is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| As a screening area, the size of that screening area, the width, length, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3858)|
| 1:04:26| can be varied by the Administrative Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| which is not a public hearing, does not have public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| There is an appeal to BZA, but if you don't know a meeting took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| and a decision was made, I don't think the public is going to be making very many appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| And once a building permit is issued, the game is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| We all know that, just from the standpoint of the finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| So what we are asking for is that that same 10-foot perimeter screening area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| also, without mentioning the plant materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| be put in the section that's oddly labeled location and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| If it's put in there as a 10-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| a reduction in that setback between the parking lot and a public street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| a reduction would have to go to BZA, which is indeed a public hearing with public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| And under BZA regulations, rules, standards for granting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| This is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| If you want the public involved, this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| We ask that that be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| Now, I have to say, I spoke about this at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| and I spoke only about, in J, there's little lowercase c, 1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| I spoke only about 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Well, 1 and 3 also need to be handled the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| And again, that's not adding new setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| It's the same perimeter screening that's already in there, in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| Also, though, move it to the section under setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| So again, a reduction in those setbacks would also go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| When it comes to adjusting the plant material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| let it go before the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| We think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| But when it comes to reducing a setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| that ought to go before BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| It ought to be part of a public process with public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| That's the way the ordinance functions at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| At present, there is a 10-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| It is a setback, and it's appealable to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| The other thing we're asking for is what Councilman Della Vopi had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| And in communicating back and forth with Executive Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| and on the yellow sheet, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| under 3, or parking lots with common frontage in the same block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| with residentially zoned property and located on roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| with less than four existing travel lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| shall be set back 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| We would ask that that version of R3 be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4045)|
| 1:07:33| We think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| After the or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| Yes, after the or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| And we also ask that two very narrow sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| lowercase J, lowercase, well, capital J,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| lowercase c, 1, and 3, as a very narrow review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| the same thing as the setback I spoke to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| be sent back to MPC on a very narrow review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| of simply those two setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| Council, in order to follow the Robert's Rules of Order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| in order for me to have any discussion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| I'm going to have to step aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| And if it's agreeable with Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Mayor Brown has agreed that he'll preside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| for the rest of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Can we not suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| I mean, you voted, I mean, I was surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| I'm allowed to vote, but I can't deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| If you're following Robert's Rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| if the presiding officer is a member of the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| and he wants to engage in the debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| he needs to step down from presiding over the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| so that he can engage in debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| If you would like to suspend Robert's Rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| for that purpose, yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| How would it be different if Mayor Brown steps in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| Mayor Brown would have to agree not to engage in the debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| but just simply preside over the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| He could still vote, but he would not engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| in the vocal debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Why don't we just suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| I'll suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| I move that we suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Okay, there's been a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| that we suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| So, Mr. Dellivopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| Yeah, I wanted a clarification from either Rob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| or from Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| On the suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Yeah, I wanted to understand the distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| between the change to the one provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| which talks about two different sides of the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| which seems to be both mentioned at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| and a minor change at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| and the idea of picking up whatever was in J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| that talked about screening and making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| that those same physical distances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| were in the setback section 7C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Is that enough to have to send it back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| if that's part of the current law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| and we're just sort of putting it back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| I would have to defer to Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| with regard to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| because I don't know whether that's a subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| that was discussed by the professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| and by the planning commission and came in this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| It would be okay, and you could go ahead and amend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| if you wanted to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| if that's the will of the council to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| But if it hasn't been reviewed or discussed by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| then it would have to be sent back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| If it has been, if it's been a part of the process already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| then you could amend it within those parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| Gerald Green, director of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| That setback was discussed at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| when we talked about the landscaping requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| of the distance from the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| or the edge of the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| to the edge of the parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| was identified and discussed numerous times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| as we discussed the overall landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| And it was always...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| I'm trying to recall, this has gone on for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| but I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| My recollection is I described it as a setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| even in that the parking lot would be setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| and a perimeter screening area would be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| within that setback, that 10-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| I do want to clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| if the council decides to accept this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| and make that change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| that the word in Section C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| that the setback shall be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| is required for the perimeter screening area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| because for lots less than 20,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| that setback is only 6 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| But in essence, you didn't intend to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| the route of review and appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| by putting it under screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| You were just addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| how much distance you needed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| So it would be in the same intent that MPC had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| which was it's part of the setback process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| And if I could say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| and I think it's reflected in the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| of the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| we spoke specifically about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| the setback from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| Just the lowercase c2, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| The setback from the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| which I believe is 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| Thank God there's a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| That's for a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| We could look at what Mr. Green said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Isn't the setback 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| regardless of the size of the parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| If it's less than 20,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| it's 6 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| It could be reduced to 6 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| Okay, it could be reduced to 6 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| We need to get the language right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| Clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| What wasn't discussed at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| was lowercase c1 and c2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| Those might have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| for narrow review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| but those are also very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Those are, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| and it doesn't affect commercial or office at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| This has to do with a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| for something like a school or a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| up against residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| That's a 15-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| Again, it doesn't have anything to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| with commercial or office up against residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| It would be almost residential against residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| but a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| C3, I think, has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| a 5-foot setback between parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| or between parking lots and mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| parking lots and other non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| These are minimal things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| but they're very, very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| and they should go before BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| if they're going to be varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| The way to do that is to put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| in the section that says setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Speaking to Mr. Green and speaking to Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| I think we're all under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| that these were setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| until it began looking a little bit odd to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| We started asking questions in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| and then they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| Council, I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| and this pertains to J1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| Mr. Green, if you would kind of explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| a little bit about the history of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| This has to do with the size of parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| and the amount of landscaping that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| I know that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| 10,000 to 20,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| I know that this council in the last eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| has worked real hard to see to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| that our city is green and that we have trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| and greenways and this sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| and landscaping within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| I'm concerned about the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| that I know that we had talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| in terms of what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| So if you would kind of give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| a little bit of the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| of what has happened in J1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Well, let me start where we are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| and I want to state that the greatest change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| is that in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| we are requiring landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| for parking lots that exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| 10,000 square feet in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| Currently, only a handful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| or very few zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| commercial zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| require any landscaping in a parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| We're making a great step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| by requiring landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| with those starting at parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| with 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| At one point, there was a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| We started this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| by stating that the threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| would be 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| with requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| landscaping between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| the street and the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| landscaping around the perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| with a provision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| parking lots between 20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| and 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| could eliminate the perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| landscaping between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| commercial parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| so that the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| abutted in commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| they would not have to have perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| landscaping. There would still be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| requirement for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| landscaped area along the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| which could be reduced to 6 feet in width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| from the 10 feet for those parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| between 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| and 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| If they abutted residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| they would have to have the perimeter screening area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| There was a provision at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| to reduce that upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| looking at the examples of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| small parking lots and the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| that would be incurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| in providing landscaping in those small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| parking lots. The city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| staff and NPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| worked on drafting the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| went back to the original provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| the NPC, the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| commission recommended approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| of that revision knowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| again we're taking a great step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| forward with this ordinance by requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| consistent uniform landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| for all parking areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| regardless of the zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| something that we don't have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| So we do have requirements then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| for 10,000 and above?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| Correct. Is what you're looking at right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Currently we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| And then another question I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| is section D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| number 2. It says in calculating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| parking requirements for restaurants the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| of decks, patios and other outdoor areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| used for seating shall be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| included in a gross floor area used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| as the basis for calculating parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| requirements and you recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| deleting that? Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| And why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| I mean those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| seats count don't they? I mean people get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| by car or somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| They're seasonal seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| to be quite honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| the person who suffers if they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| provide parking for those seasonal seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| are the operations and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| that when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| go to any place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| eat or drink if it's good weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| I notice everyone's sitting outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| the inside is empty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| if it's bad weather it's the opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| very few places that have all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| seats occupied at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| and so we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| acknowledge the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| lack of full capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| in those places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| of businesses that have both indoor and outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| seating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| why require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| permanent parking for a space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| that's used on a temporary basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| Understand, just wanted clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| let me go back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| 10,000 square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| or the landscaping requirements for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| you still have the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| for the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| and for the side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| For 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| 20,000 square feet of vehicular use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| area I think it's important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| distinguish between just parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| and vehicular use area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| this addresses vehicular use area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| that could include drive aisles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| drive through aisles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| the 10,000 square feet is included in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| and if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| vehicular use area is between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| 10,000 square feet and 20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| square feet that would be a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| for a landscape screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| strip between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| the street and the parking or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| vehicular use area and if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| vehicular use area abuts a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| residentially zoned property that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| a requirement for a landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| area there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| And islands also? Islands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| that would be interior islands, terminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| islands and if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| run is more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| 15 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| there would have to be an interior island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| within that run of parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Aren't we going to keep it at 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| In this draft it's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| to keep it at 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| We had talked about 10 though right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| We had talked about 10 and upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| reflection and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| with the city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| and the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| it was determined to leave that at 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| My notes say based upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| comments received on April 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| staff is willing to discuss this proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| revision in an effort to reach a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| reasonable standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| And so you're now coming saying it's 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| That's what the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| has recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| There's one item of confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| I thought in those smaller parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| you had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| exterior screening or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| buffering landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| but you didn't have to have the interior island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| stuff because they're so small that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| take up the usable space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| I'm looking at what I see as J1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| maybe I'm reading that wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| but it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| less than 20,000 vehicular use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| are exempt from interior landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| But you do have to have the screening from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| out at the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| Thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| I guess I have to make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| I'm going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| that we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| I guess it's three changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| and luckily they're encompassed on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| yellow sheet of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Article 1 we're going to use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Article 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Section 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| the first item on the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| we're going to take that as it's written there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Number 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| we're going to ask that setback language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| be moved forward from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| landscaping J section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| 7C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| so that it's clear we're talking about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| setback and we're just going to mirror image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| putting it forward into Section 7C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| On the third item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| we're going to pick the second choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| when we change Article VC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| to the one that reads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| parking lots with common frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| in the same block with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| residentially zoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| and located on roads with less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| than four existing travel lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| shall be setback 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| feet from the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| line provided however that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| setback shall not apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| to multi-dwelling structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| or developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| I understood from the presentation at the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| that the second alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| in Article 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| C2 was preferable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| so we're picking that one in my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| so we have three changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| to the motion as noted on the yellow page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| If I could just clarify one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| what Mr. Green said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| about the six feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| for parking lots less than 20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| is absolutely correct and if you would add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| that to my language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| the yellow sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Is that on item 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| That would be item 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Shall be 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Except where it's less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| 10,000 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| it would be 6 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=4996)|
| 1:23:24| Except where the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| is less than 20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| the setback would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| reduced to 6 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| reduced to 6 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5014)|
| 1:23:42| I'd say that's part of your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| That's part of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Councilman Del Valle, can I add a friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| amendment to your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| I'm way over my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Go ahead, jump in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I'd like to, under section J3B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| where they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| recommended 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| spaces in the rows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| I'd like to amend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| to 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| That's not friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| That's not friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| That's unfriendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| It's not in the same vein of what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Let's move on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| If you want to add other things, let's move on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Why don't we let him tell me if it's friendly or unfriendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| I feel the sense of the body is that it's unfriendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| but we can take it as a second motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| after we act on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| We have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| All those in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| The ayes have it, any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| The ayes have it and so ordered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| Now we've got J2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| Now we're dealing with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| motion as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Motion as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| He wanted to make a separate motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| to amend section J3.B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| in parking rows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| runs of more than 10 parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| shall be broken by an interior island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| My motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| You're changing 15 to 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Is that what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| We have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| I'm going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| Gerald Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| You obviously wrestled with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| this 10 and 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| Why is 15 better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| Or is 10 better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| 15 is realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| what boils down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| 15 would not pose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| undue burden on the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| of commercial spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| that would provide for breaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| in those runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| of parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| When you have a long run you need the break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| in the interior island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| And this would be at every 15 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| That's consistent with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| that were researched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| And that is the recommendation of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| When you say the width of a space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| is that 8 feet, 12 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| 9 to 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| So 150 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| 150 feet versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| 100 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| So we'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| 100 feet in an island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| as opposed to what's in there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| 150 feet in an island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| than 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Mr. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| While my remarks are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| be about this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| it in fact applies to the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| MPC and the staff have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| very hard on this. They have coordinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| with neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| with businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| and developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| And they've come up with what I think is a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| And I am certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| in support of their efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| If we look at what the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| itself did, they voted unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| for this and I would like to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| You're opposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| I agree. My words exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| MPC vetted this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| There's been a lot of public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| You've got the support of realtors, developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| which are very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| When you're talking 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Let's put it in perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| 10,000 square feet is a quarter acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| These are very small lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| on your commercial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| You're not talking about a Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| You're talking about a very small lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| that you're already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| giving some leeway to the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| to minimize and maximize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| parking, but it's a greater restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| to add in additional island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| every 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| But MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| voted it unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| and I recommend we approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| except for we made the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| that Carlene and Gerald agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| and I think that's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| This is a huge step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Everybody's in agreement with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| I just don't think we ought to tinker with it at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| Mr. Stare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| I certainly appreciate the other comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| made and I think I see where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| this is going, but just to be clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| this doesn't apply to lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| this provision we're amending now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| No, that's what he's asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| He's asking for it to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| He's asking for it to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| He's just amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| 3B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| the number 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| and 3B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| and if you look at Section 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| lots less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| 20,000 square feet are exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| from the interior land requirements in Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5333)|

| 1:28:57| So this is only applying to lots greater than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| And I'll have an amendment after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| but I think it's one everybody should be able to agree upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| We've seen that though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| not to be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| parts approximately 50 cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| So that's what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| So what we're saying is instead of going 150 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| and having a break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| we're going 100 feet and having a break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| is what I'm asking for in this particular one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| There has been a motion made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5373)|

| 1:30:03| Mr. Steyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| On page 419| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| under Section 2C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| On that third paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| J2C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| Should there be a 3 there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| in that third paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| Oh like perimeter screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| Does that need to be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| or is that just a hyphen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Repeat that Marshall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Well I think it's relevant because in Section 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| it refers to subsection J2C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| and then when you go to look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| I'm sure as we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| did to look for Section J2C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| it doesn't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| so I think it's important that it's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| If you didn't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| we would probably call it a Scrivener's Error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| and fix it anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| but now that you know about it in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| you might as well go ahead and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| I'll make that motion to add a 3 there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| Add the number 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| in front of the third paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| in Section J2C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| Send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| The motion's been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| and seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| so any further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| All those in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| Now do we move on the whole thing as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| Now we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| Question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| Call the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Do I hear a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Alright we're going to move on the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| All those in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5498)|

| 1:31:42| The ayes have it and so ordered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| 12D is an ordinance to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5508)|

| 1:32:06| We might have speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| Ms. Malone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| and Mr. Sandler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5530)|

| 1:32:14| Still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5534)|

| 1:32:24| Give him the cup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| Sorry we were continuing our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5550)|

| 1:32:38| Knoxville Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| If we want to preserve the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| of zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| so that you can tell one zone from another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| the C1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| needs to have different standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| and operate and look different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| from C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| or C4 or C2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| One important way of doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| and I think this was demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| by Mr. Sandler out east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| is to make sure you have a limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| on the size of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5584)|

| 1:33:10| people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| from two counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| to the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| Local service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| There are very few C1's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| left in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| They are in the middle of places like Sequoia Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| They are on corners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| outside of Dare Gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| They are a few sprinkled around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| They were not meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| to serve more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| Many of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| you don't want to draw the kind of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| that you would get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| for a C3 or C4 much bigger operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| I think this is about preserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| the character of this zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| and respecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| the setting in which they presently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| I think this is an excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| ordinance that ought to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5644)|

| 1:34:22| 37902| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| I'm speaking against this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| for several reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| One,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| this is sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| picking apart one little zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| You've got a general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| revision to your zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| coming up sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| probably early next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| Two, it is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| I may be wrong on my suspicion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| to go after one particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| niche of the retail market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| That is the dollar stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| neighborhood stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5696)|

| 1:35:00| business from two counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5700)|

| 1:35:04| has 26 stores in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| County alone and would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| increase it beyond that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Two, certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| if the ordinance was enacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| there ought to be a procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| for a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| to increase the size of the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| under certain circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| Each of these dollar stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| and there are five or six of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Family Dollar, Dollar General, Dollar Tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| They all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| footprints, most of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| are over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| 5,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| So there should be a use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| review procedure to evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| those if they go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| the 5,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| because the building they're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| can be much larger than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| 5,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| and certainly it ought to exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| any permit applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| that are presently in process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| and I'm aware of two of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| Boyd's Bridge Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| and the other one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| I just want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| the permit has not been finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| The plans have been submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| I think there have been comments that have come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| to the architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| and that process takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| weeks and maybe a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| It was submitted under the then existing code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| so that's what applies to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| And the other one is too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| The other one is too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| It's submitted under the existing code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| haven't some of these stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| haven't they gone to smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Each one has a different footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Dollar, General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Their smallest footprint is 7,500 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| They do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| in high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| pedestrian traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| areas, prototypes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| that may be a little smaller than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| but typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| unless they are a larger market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| they run from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| 7,500 square feet to 9,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| I'd like to just clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| when we reviewed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| and worked on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| we were not looking at any particular store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| There was no particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| business or operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| In fact, the name that came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| most often was Walmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| because currently with the C1 Zoning District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| a Walmart of 100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| square feet could locate within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| a C1 Zoning District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| And that's what, if anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| we did not want that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| We looked at the purpose of the C1 Zoning District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| which as Ms. Malone said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| it is to serve a small neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| They're located in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| where traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| outside traffic is not desired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| Dollar, General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| Their smallest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| footprint is 3,700| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| square feet. They call it their urban model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| They put it in cities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| standards for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| businesses within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| certain districts. We have lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| opportunities within the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| for any size business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| to locate. The concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| that larger businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| and the traffic they generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| and the population they serve are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| appropriate for small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| neighborhood serving zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Mr. Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| Actually, Mr. Wallace had his later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| on long before me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| He always looks left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| Mr. Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| This appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| I respect what Gerald is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| that this doesn't apply to anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| but it never became an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| until eight weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| when we had this zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| on Boyds Bridge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| It appears very reactionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| and it appears to me to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| really retaliatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| that we're coming after one specific use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| I think that we're in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| We're deeply in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| We have public meetings next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| and on through this fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| to recode Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| This is what our recode is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| The agenda item that follows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| this item has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| in C3 and C6 issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| We've been talking about for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Mr. Green's efforts to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| something that will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| and trying to get mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| in some of our corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| We've been talking about it for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| This one, we voted on it eight weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| and to expedite it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| that way without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| to me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| what's the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| When you've got recode, you're sitting on top of recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| It's all about Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| That's what we're here to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| I find that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| I view them as about five stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| It's the retail model today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| The retail model is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| We're going to let recode address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| I think the appropriate thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| is to deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| and then see how it shakes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| in recode and then address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| as we go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| I plan to oppose it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Mr. Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| Thank you Mr. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| I'm conflicted and confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| on this one. In fact, it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| reduce the size of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| to 5,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| The building could be 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| but the space for any one tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| has to be 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| I guess that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| confounds me because I don't know why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| an owner couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| rent 7,500 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| It confuses me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| I'm not comfortable with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| in its current form so I would rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| wait on the recoding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| Ms. Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you. I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Councilman Wallace and Councilman Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| I think this needs to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| when we have the recoding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| within the next couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| But I think for us to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| consideration right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| is not a wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| move on the part of this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| I just really believe that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| need to be prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| in making changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| and then the big recoding occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| and there are changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| in that recoding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| and this could be part of the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| Mr. Stare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| I certainly appreciate the comments of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| but I think it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| good ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| for a couple of reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| One is just the C1 zone itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| I mean this is the zone we're trying to mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| into neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| I felt like my whole time on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| we're always battling commercial and neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| This is the zone where we're trying to mix that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| and to do that we're going to have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| neighborhoods to trust us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| and you can't just throw any old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| retail establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| or we're just going to continue this fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| between the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| We've got to find some common ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| The C1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| there's so few examples of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| to me they're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| precious opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| to create something really special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| sort of like the Sono Taco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| I don't know if that's C1 or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| there's some in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| there's some on Lion's View| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| sort of right next to Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| something really unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| that adds value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| because I think there is demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| that people want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| and shops and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| that have a unique nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| close to their store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| so I think this by limiting the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| really gets at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| so I think it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| and I'm going to support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Council Palmer had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| good thoughts on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| I think the most prudent thing to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| to wait and see how it plays out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| but I just want to give an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| exactly where I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| because we don't all live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| with due respect in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| to where you can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| three to four minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| to practically any type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| retail establishment that you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| so I'm going to take you to my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| out on Topside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| nine miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| one way to get to Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| that's up at Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| or I've got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| option of going to Northshore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| Topside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| or I've got the option of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| all the way up Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| through our beautiful traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| issues there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| to Publix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| or I've got the option which I wouldn't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| is to go to Maryville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| to shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| so just keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| retail establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| certainly serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| more than just the real urban core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| so we have these pockets out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| and everybody needs to be aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| of these pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| to where there's a Dollar General store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| two miles, maybe a mile and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| from my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| it serves, I can't do my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| everyday, every week shopping there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| but it certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| and I hate to even throw that name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| out there, but it serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| it fills a gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| instead of having to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| that's a long ways, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| 30-45 minutes to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| those trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| so I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| this council to be aware that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| there's pockets in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| that welcome it as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| We've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6318)|

| 1:46:20| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| I would like to just say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| we asked for this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| or I had asked for this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| on February 3rd of 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| As you pointed out, this has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| going on for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| We do have individuals who are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| in that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| in the Bearden Village area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| to have housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| This was one of the reasons we did this back in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| It's been a long journey, right Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| It started before I got here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| But it's going to be finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| while you're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Anyway, as you can imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| I'm in full support of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| Mr. Steyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Thank you, I am too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| I think in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6420)|

| 1:53:07| That's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Okay for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| forum we have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| individuals that would like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| Wilkerson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| Are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| The next person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| is Barbara| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| I can't pronounce that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Barbara Cook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| You will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| come forward, state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| You'll have five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| My name is Barbara Cook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| 4221 Chinquapin Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| Good evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| I'm here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| to ask the questions you didn't bother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| neither at the last meeting on the 29th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| of August nor at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| of June 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| or obviously at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| during the process of allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| Helen Ross McNabb to set up a jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| diversion center in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| residential neighborhood and granting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| them funds to operate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| We citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| depend on you to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| yourselves on the issues that come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| We citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| hope you do more than just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| listen to one side of the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| before reaching a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| We citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| hope you would at least question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| why there is such opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| that we would take the time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| organize and appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| at countless meetings to protest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| Perhaps you think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| nothing better to do with our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| Not only did you come off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| as a group that marches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| lockstep with the political in-crowd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| but you didn't even try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| disguise it by paying some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| deference to the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| No engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| No discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| Not one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| Only one acknowledgement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| that the subject being brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| forward was worthwhile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| I personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| commend Councilman Della Volpe for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| trying, but obviously this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| couldn't care less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| Facts and logic mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| nothing to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| But I digress. I promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| you questions. Let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| start with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| To Peter Ahrens, the building official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| whose definition of what constitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| a hospital is folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| staying overnight and being treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| It doesn't matter why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| were admitted, what they're treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| for, or even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| whether the condition they suffer from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| is medically related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| The jail treats prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| and they stay overnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| Does that make the jail a hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Officials are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| saying that the opioid abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| crisis is filling the jails so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| full that they need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| inpatient rehab centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| Will these facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| be considered hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| and thus allowed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| O1 zones right on top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| I submit that with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| type of loosey-goosey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| interpretation and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| all the grant money floating around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| to the first taker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| it won't be long where there won't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| anyone in jail. They'll all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| be taking respite in rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| facilities scattered throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| And while I'm on the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| of grant money, maybe it's time we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| pulled the cloak of secrecy off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| changing hands relating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| to folks with mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| or substance abuse issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| It has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| become big business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| and with all the hand-wringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| going on over the opioid abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| crisis, it promises to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| become an even bigger business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| As a society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| we seem to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| that throwing money at a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| solves the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| It seldom does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| Just ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| the district attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| how difficult it has become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| to use the $165,000 grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| for Vivitrol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| that was supposed to be given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| on an outpatient basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| The criminals don't want to leave the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| They're afraid of relapsing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| While officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| say they need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| inpatient rehab centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| Constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| citing the numbers of prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| in the jail who are drug abusers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| and or have mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| becomes an easy way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| divert the attention away from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| real issues surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| local jail overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| Namely, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| judicial system that is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| ineffective and inefficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| that prisoners wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| forever for trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| Add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| the willingness to accept state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| prisoners in order to obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| that much needed reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| and that's how jails get overcrowded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| Never mind their physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| or mental condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| There must have been a crime committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| to get them there in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| So why can't the justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| get its act together and process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| those folks out of the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| rather than taking taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| to set up separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| more costly facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| especially in residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| I have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| other questions I want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| but I'll defer them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| Before I run out of time here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| I have just one suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| for you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| If you can't take the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| to look at the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| that come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| or if you're not willing to take the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| or if you're just not smart enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| what questions to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| then hire someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| to do it for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| because you're not doing a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| to anyone by just taking up space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170912?start=7141)|
