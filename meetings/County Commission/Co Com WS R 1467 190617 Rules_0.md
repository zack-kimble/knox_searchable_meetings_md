| 0:00:31| I call to order this meeting of the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| Madam Clerk, would you please take roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=35)|
| 0:00:39| Commissioner Smith? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=39)|
| 0:00:41| Commissioner Anders? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=41)|
| 0:00:43| Commissioner Boesler? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| Commissioner Daley? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=44)|
| 0:00:46| Commissioner Jay? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=46)|
| 0:00:54| All right. The first item on our agenda is to approve the previous minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| I believe we have two packets of minutes to approve, the one from the last meeting that Chairman Daley chaired and the reorganization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=58)|
| 0:01:10| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Okay. We have a proper motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| So there's a quorum because there's five. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| Three of five, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| The first item of discussion is discussion of previous rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=87)|
| 0:01:31| We haven't met in about a year because under Chairman Daley there was quite a few rule changes made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=91)|
| 0:01:38| and I wanted to make sure how all those flowed and were working properly before we looked to make any other adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=98)|
| 0:01:45| And I want to commend Chairman Daley on those rule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| Things seem to be working really well, and they were really point-on changes that needed to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| Does anybody else have any thoughts about how the rules have worked over the last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=115)|
| 0:02:04| Well, what's the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| I mean, I've been here ten months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| They seem to work pretty well, although there's several we don't really enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| but I think I have a couple ideas on the next agenda item, but, I mean, they seem to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| We'll move right to item number four, discussion of possible action and any rules to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| We have with us also present is Chairman Nystrom, and he wanted to throw something out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| So, Chairman Nystrom, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=150)|
| 0:02:40| Thank you, Commissioner Smith and members of the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| One small suggestion for you all to consider, and it's come up, I noticed, not frequently, but in about two commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=163)|
| 0:02:52| and it's usually been when we have had a resolution to recognize someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| primarily resolutions of that nature that have been added usually after the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| It's happened two or three times since I've been commission chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| and what I've found is that we find ourselves needing to do the actual recognition before we've set the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| which, you know, frankly, they're getting their recognition no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| but it struck me that it made a little more sense to move the parts of our meetings where we set our agenda towards the very front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=200)|
| 0:03:29| and not after when we've had opportunities to recognize members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| So that's my, you know, however many months I've been chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| that was just one suggestion that I wanted to make for you all to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| is basically move the part where we set the agenda up a little bit forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| I'd also want to commend the committee because things have been moving very smoothly after all those rules have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| and as chair I've worked very hard to try and follow the set agenda that came out of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| However, we all know occasionally we have lengthy discussions, and there are times, as you all have seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| where I do skipple around a little bit on the agenda just for the sake of either getting the school folks out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| or just for the sake of efficiency, so when I've done those, and it's really been in more recent meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| it's never been an intent to not follow the rules that this committee has set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| It's just been, as chair, just to try and get our meetings out a little bit quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| But otherwise, everything has been great, and just wanted to give you all that one suggestion to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Looking at our work session agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=274)|
| 0:04:43| the amendments to the agenda follows the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| I think it would be appropriate if we had our regular meeting also follow that pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| If you look at our work session agenda, do you have one for today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| The only time that this might, just because it's been so recent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| that could be advantageous to setting the agenda before that might be if we notice that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| just to be frank, here's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| When we were debating the subject around the indigent care program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| we had a lot of folks speak at public forum for a long time before we got to setting our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| and then doing the actual recognition of some of the teams that we had here that particular night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| just because public forum came first, and then when we had the resolutions for recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| So, that was just one thing that I thought to myself, you know, we may want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| and I guess the chair can have the discretion to do that, but I know I was trying to follow the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| and that's just one aspect of that that we should and could consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| Otherwise, we just, if the rules committee say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| chair has the discretion to move things around a little bit in case we know we're going to have a fairly lengthy public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| and we may want to, if we've got a baseball team or some kids here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| I don't want to wait for an hour or 30 minutes if we think we've got a long public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| So, just another thing to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| That's exactly what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| So, where is it that you're wanting to place the amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| Personally, I'd love to have it right out of the gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| We open the meeting, we have a prayer and pledge, set the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| and then at that time that gives us a chance if we think we need to move something forward or behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| and then go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| That would be my preference, but I'm certainly, we'll follow whatever recommendation this committee makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| The only thing that I worry about whenever we set the agenda after, before public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| is somebody may come up in public forum and have an item that they wish not to be on consent that they want to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| If we've already set the agenda, we'd have to go back and vote on that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| I think it would be best to have the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| On our work session, I think it's pretty much right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| The pledge to the flag, public forum, amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| On our regular meetings, we have devotional, pledge, public forum, honorary resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| approval of the previous minutes, then amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| This looks perfect the way it's going to flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| I think if we left it after public forum, that way we have a chance to get input from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| but also give the chairman discretion to have some of these presentations done before public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| Mr. Law Director, is that something we can provide, is discretion for the chairman to move things for time's sake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| He's going to say whatever he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| Whatever commission desires, we can do and make sure it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| I'm perfectly fine with that, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| I think that would be fine, as long as this chair and future chairs have a little bit of discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| based on length of public forum or some of those other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| Discussion items can be heard before the agenda is set, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| Whenever you want to hear them, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| You can do that before you set the agenda, if that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| Commissioner Daly, Vice Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| I mean, that public forum is kind of a moving thing because some people call in ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| and then Drew will have people just wander up and say they want to be on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| and she's got to get that up to the chairman, and that's a moving thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| Generally, all the chairmen, including Chairman Nystrom, have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| look, if you want to speak on a particular item, if you want to hold off, that takes care of some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| But then some people just want to come and say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| But however a commission wants to do it, there's no prohibition or requirement that you do it before or after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| As I said, the specific thing that it came up on is really specifically to resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| where we're recognizing someone, where we have occasionally done the recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| before we actually passed the item just because it was added the item to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| So that might be something that we could just move those around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| and then otherwise have chairman's discretion moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| I think I now understand and misunderstood what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| How can you pass a resolution on an honorarium if it's not on the agenda and approved for the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=577)|
| 0:09:48| I misunderstood what you were saying, but, yeah, I see what you're saying now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| and I haven't thought about that, because you can't pass something that's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| And it happens rarely, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Mr. Chairman, I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Most of the time the honorary resolutions are on the consent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| Yes, on the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| And we honor them at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| But if they're on the consent, I mean, the stuff I agree with Chairman Nystrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| that having people sit through what could be a fairly long, lengthy process to then be recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| it seems a little bit out of order, and it gets awkward, and they all kind of want to do their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| So that part is very ceremonial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Is there any reason we couldn't put honorary resolutions just right up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| knowing it's on the consent calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| I mean, it's a ceremonial presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| We know it's going to pass because it's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| Well, they're typically not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| They're normally passed with no recommendation so that they move to the regular meeting to still be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| If they were passed on consent, they wouldn't be voted on at the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| So I guess the question would be, why don't we put those on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| Is there a reason they need to be voted on at the commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Typically that's just part of the ceremony is to read the resolution, vote on it, make the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| I'm asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| Vice Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| I understand what Larson is saying, that even if it was on the consent calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| we vote on the consent calendar, and it's in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| Why can't we just go ahead and have it voted in and then read the resolution at the time on the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| We don't vote on the consent agenda until farther down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| My concern is that all these people like ‑‑ I think this is what you all were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| that we have the baseball team or a big group of people that are sitting here for an hour, hour and 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| We need to find out somehow to get these honorary and these commission resolutions up front quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| Does that mean that ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| We could just swap and move honorary resolutions to right after we do the agenda, set the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| do the honorary resolutions, then go to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| That's what ‑‑ that was going to be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| Can I make a motion to the committee to do what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Yes, and also leave the discretion for the chairman to pull forward discussion and presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| So to repeat that, that would be to be moving honorary resolutions right after the agenda being set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=751)|
| 0:12:39| and before public forum with always the discretion of the chair to rearrange as he or she may see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=759)|
| 0:12:48| Is that a good enough motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| I think we understand what we're trying to do here is on commission meetings, not on the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| We're moving item F, amendments to the agenda, up to under C, after public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=780)|
| 0:13:12| in case there's anybody that has something that they wish to bring off consent or want to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| and then we move honorary resolutions right under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| And then public forum would be right after that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| No, that doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| No, you'd still have public forum first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| Uh‑huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| But don't ‑‑ wouldn't the chairman have discretion to go ahead and do the honorary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| or the resolutions before public forum if we needed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Or do we need to put it in order that that's how it's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| We have it in that order, and then it's up to the chairman's discretion to do honorary resolutions before public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| or to bring any presentation or discussion items forward in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| I'm happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| I mean, if we have a big crowd again, you know, the chairman said we're going to move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Okay, so law department following us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Yeah, I have to repeat all of that to make sure I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Can I just ask a quick, just sort of parliamentary question before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| So the goal on this rules committee today is to maybe decide to pass things out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| or make recommendations that would then go to the committee for final approval as one big slate of adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Individually, the items go to commission to be voted on individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| But the goal is to vote on things today that would come out of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| All right, we don't have a second yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| What was the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Yeah, we need to motion one more time and then I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Would you like to repeat the motion for me, Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Shorten it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Because you have it written down in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| I don't have it written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| You have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| What did you have written down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| I just have the chairman's discussion for presentations and discussions, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Are you switching the order to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Yes, it's the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| So it's going to go propositional pledge to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| I think it was pledge and then devotional, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Don't we do pledge first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| No, devotional, then pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Devotional pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Honoraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Before you would discuss doing honoraries and then public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Yeah, but we have to get the agenda in before the honoraries and I still, and if you all don't agree with this, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=936)|
| 0:15:46| I still think that it's best that we don't set an agenda until we've heard from the public in case there is something they wish to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| I don't want us to put things on consent that somebody's here that wants to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Our fields should be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Yeah, I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| I just wanted to kind of bring to our attention occasionally it really just seems to happen more around recognition-related resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| And as long as we've kind of got, you know, as chair and for all our future chairs, I know they all want to try hard to follow the rules as they come out of this committee because it has made us more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=971)|
| 0:16:21| But maybe if the rules do indicate that there is some discretion for the chair to move things around for the sake of efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| And on everything or just those two things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Really, that could be just those two, although there have been times where, you know, many of our commissioners, you know, say, hey, we've got A, B, or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=992)|
| 0:16:41| Not everybody, but there's not a meeting that passes that someone doesn't mention to the chair, somebody's here to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| Can we move this up in order to get something, to get our meeting done a little bit quicker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| And while each individual commissioner may only do that once every three months, collectively there's always at least one or two every single meeting that says, hey, can we move this to the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1013)|
| 0:17:03| Can we move this to try and get that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| And, you know, especially recently we've tried to do that for the sake of efficiency and also since the mayor has got most of his direct reports that are now staying through our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| So I guess that's just something that I want to acknowledge and just find a way where within the rules, you know, because once again as chair I did my best the first part of my term just to follow the rules as they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1033)|
| 0:17:27| But then in more recent meetings I've been skipping around a little bit just to kind of keep our – try to get our meetings run a little bit more quicker or to get people out if we know that they're here for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1047)|
| 0:17:37| Mr. Law Director, that discretion I believe is already in the power of the chair, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| Generally, yes, and that's also under Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| There's a lot of discretion within the agenda to make sure everything gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| And as you know, when you move to bring something up, you bring it in front of full commission and they always agree with you or see the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1072)|
| 0:18:01| So you've got a good commission because they want to adapt to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| And the alternate I think is if someone does object it just goes to a vote to be moved, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| So do you – I guess we'll add language in here that the chair has discretion to move within the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| I think it's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Well, I mean, unless you want to attach it to this motion, which is fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| But maybe we could restate the motion as the law director, law department might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1104)|
| 0:18:32| Jill, what do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| I have it's the chairman's discretion for items within the agenda to be moved forward because you don't want to just limit it to presentations and discussions for efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1115)|
| 0:18:46| And then your order of business is devotional, pledge, public forum, amendments to agenda, and then honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| So that would be my motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| And I guess this motion needs to include to be passed on to full commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Is there any other rules that anybody wishes to talk about change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| Commissioner Gill is with us, and I believe she has something she wants to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| Yes, I'll start with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| We need to look at authority of commissions, section C, page 10, of adding a procedure to that section there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1172)|
| 0:19:47| Can you just repeat the number, section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Is that page 10 of the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Authority of committees, section C, page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| Is that the charter or the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| The rules are derived from section 2.02 of the charter, subsection I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| I've got copies here of the charter for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| That's subsection I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| It's on the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| I just ask is the rules number, the page number is on the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| It's page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| The rules don't match the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Oh, well, mine must be old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Is this a different page number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| It's on the second page of subsection I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1243)|
| 0:20:58| And the question that was brought to the law department was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1258)|
| 0:21:08| Before you start, sir, would this pertain to everybody, no matter what committee we appoint them to, whether they are a commissioner or a private citizen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1268)|
| 0:21:18| I would think so, because you have the authority under I to appoint and remove for good cause shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| And that's the key wording in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| And so the question was, how do you show good cause shown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| And the suggestion has been made that that same issue has come up with the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| and more particularly in the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| One, two, three, four people running for office that had allegations made against them that were purely political,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1308)|
| 0:22:02| Lee Trammell, Brad Anders, Bussler, and Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1322)|
| 0:22:11| There was no substance to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| The Bob Thomas and Bussler ones were brought by somebody who was running against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| I think you're leaning into your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| Oh, that's why it didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| And the ethics committee properly found and had some problems with that, using that device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| And the ethics committee has a way to assure the constitutional rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| because the Supreme Court has said everybody's got a right under the Constitution of the United States to their good name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1361)|
| 0:22:50| And based on that, they came up with the Knox County Ethics Committee Rules of Procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| and I've made copies of those, and it has been suggested that the good cause shown requirement in 202I should be accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1376)|
| 0:23:13| by similar proceedings as the ethics committee has to protect the rights of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| Because what happens is, and this was very apparent, and it was very bothersome to the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| somebody files an ethics complaint, and that hits the headlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| It's out there in the New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| It's out there in whatever blogs there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| And that's all there is, and there's no follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| So in the middle of a campaign, and I don't know whether it had an effect on any of those people in their election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1419)|
| 0:23:48| one certainly has to wonder in the mayoral election, when there was a 14-vote gap, if that had anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1428)|
| 0:23:57| They were unfounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| They were not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| And the ethics committee came up with and this county commission passed these new rules of procedure for proceeding on ethics committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1439)|
| 0:24:12| Unfortunately, anybody could file an ethics committee complaint or anybody else in the commission on anything at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1452)|
| 0:24:21| It could be during an election or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| But at any rate, we were asked to look at, and the only thing we could come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| the commission has already looked at, to come up with a due process fairness type of proceeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1468)|
| 0:24:37| to show for good cause shown on removing a committee member would be a starting point, the ethics committee rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1477)|
| 0:24:47| So that's what I've been presented here, presenting to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Obviously, there's a lot in the ethics thing that wouldn't apply in such a thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| but it's the overall, as set out in the preamble, to protect the name of an individual, give them a due process, a fair hearing on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1496)|
| 0:25:09| and there comes one of them that got attacked, Charlie Busler, during an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1509)|
| 0:25:21| And so that's what I'm just showing you and have been asked to give this committee that kind of overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1521)|
| 0:25:31| for this committee to do with as it sees fit or ask questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1531)|
| 0:25:40| So what you're saying, I guess, Mr. Law Director, is we need to set up a procedure and a process for which to process any type of desire to remove somebody from a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1540)|
| 0:25:54| I'm saying – no, I'm not suggesting you do anything in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| I'm just saying that the charter provides for the phrase can be removed for good cause shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| So how do you show good cause and does a person against whom a removal has been rendered have any ability to respond in a due process fairness type of hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1565)|
| 0:26:21| It doesn't define what's good cause shown, and I've not attempted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| This is simply a possibility that was raised about a procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| so I'm just informing this board what the procedure is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| a procedure that the commission has already approved with the ethics committee to assure a fairness and open hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1596)|
| 0:26:46| That's all I'm – I don't advocate one form or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| I'm just giving you the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| So would this – so is this a charter revision then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| I mean, the charter – or is the rule subset underneath the charter, so you're talking about creating a new rule that says here's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1618)|
| 0:27:09| Since good cause shown is not defined in the charter, it's one of those things that need to be decided by commission in the event that subsection I is rendered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1629)|
| 0:27:21| and it's just saying that the person to whom is being removed, whether it's a committee member or a commission member or a civilian, should have a right to due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1641)|
| 0:27:33| So you're saying set up a – the suggestion is to set up a process in the commission rules that deals with that particular – I mean, helps define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1653)|
| 0:27:44| And I think we would have to find a way to shape that, whether it be the motion comes to the floor in the form of a normal meeting resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| then after that we have some kind of special called meeting just to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| You could do that, yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| I also think that – I think Commissioner Daley, you had a comment, this was several months back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| of perhaps part of the process is it has to come out of committee first as a recommendation before it goes through the process of the whole commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| So if a committee decides to – that they want to remove somebody, the committee would have to vote on it first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1693)|
| 0:28:21| and if it didn't make it out of that, then it doesn't – we don't spend the time on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| and then it would come to the commission if it did for a second – sort of a second tier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| Is that – wasn't that your comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| I think it would be a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| I think that's a good process, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| I'm sorry, the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Do you think that is a good process to come out of the committee, then go to the full commission and –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| Which committee are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Any committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| But just say, like, the Rules Committee, I committed a felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| So the Rules Committee should meet and say, hey, Carson committed a felony, he should be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| The Rules Committee votes me out, then it goes to commission to be – because the Rules Committee –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| Well, I think as a felon you wouldn't be on the Rules Committee anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| but let's say you never showed up for a meeting and we said, look, he doesn't come to the meetings, he's not engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| we don't think Carson, you know, should be on this because he's not participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| So we vote on it and say, yes, we recommend to the commission that he be removed from the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| if he hasn't done so voluntarily, and then it would go up to the commission to make that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| but, again, you're talking about creating a new set of process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| I'm just bringing to you a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| The problem is, and here again one of the people I mentioned was Charles Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| when his political opposition filed an ethics complaint against him in the heat of a political campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| And he did have a right, he did come in, and he had to hire an attorney and defend his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| and the Ethics Committee found there was nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| The key is that he did have a chance under the rules to come in there and cross-examine, put on witnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1795)|
| 0:30:04| cross-examine the accuser, and have his day in court as it was, as part of a due process, fairness type of hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1804)|
| 0:30:13| How do you do it? I can draft something if this committee wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| I'm not making a recommendation one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| I'm just bringing to you subsection I and the one that the commission has already approved that is a due process, fairness type of hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1820)|
| 0:30:30| Go ahead, Commissioner Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| I think you need procedural safeguards in place, because there are people who will use the process without due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1835)|
| 0:30:44| to make whatever political statement they want to make, and it needs to have something in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| What would be the vast difference between a commission meeting going through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| than having a special call meeting for the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| Doesn't everyone have ample time to prepare a defense at that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| Let me respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I did not. So there was no due process for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Well, your case was kind of special because you couldn't really talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| When we came to full commission, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| So there was no due process, and I'm here saying there needs to be a new procedural safeguard in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| because there was no due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| What would have went different between that meeting and a special call meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| I think what's in here is that at a special call meeting, there would be more formality with regard to somebody being able to call witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1897)|
| 0:31:51| For instance, if a committee said, well, we vote by a majority of a quorum that that person ought to be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| that person should have a right to call other members of the committee and say, well, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| I mean, cross-examination, that is one of the bases of constitutional due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| So to answer your question, it would be more of a formal thing at a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| where there would be the right for the accused to respond, face whoever was voting against them and ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1935)|
| 0:32:24| and then commission would make a response or a finding, just like the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| which votes on that they make a finding one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Okay. Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| I'll do this in the form of a motion if everybody agrees that we ask the Law Department to formalize a procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| It may not have to be as intense as the ethics rules of the procedure, but I agree we do need some type of procedure that we need to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1963)|
| 0:32:54| and I'll make that in the form of a motion that we ask the Law Department to write out a rules of procedure for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1974)|
| 0:33:03| Just as a clarification, that would come back to the Rules Committee for review and engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Okay. Mr. Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you. I think one of the points that you have in here is it says for good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| We don't have a definition for good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| So we can make a rule, and when it gets here, we do not have good cause for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| So we really need to define what good cause is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| We need to go down there and say this is good cause, this is good cause, this is good cause, and you've got to have some kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| but just say blanket good cause, you know, I might dislike her red dress, and I want that removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| I want it removed because she wears red dresses, you know, in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| For me, that would be good cause for me, but it wouldn't be good cause for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| Why, you get jealous because it doesn't match your red dress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| So if you don't go down the list of what a good cause is on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| and then once you do it, you're still going to have to bring it before the full commission, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| I'm just wondering if that's too broad for reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| Well, you could make a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| I mean, you could say good cause such as bullet point, bullet point, bullet point, bullet point, bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| It may not include all the bullet points that you would run up against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| but there's probably a small subset of ten that apply to most things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| I mean, it's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| You're never going to get it down to zero, but you may be able to say here are some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| But again, this would be for the law department to tick through and kind of come up with a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| Not for voting on today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| Commissioner, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Commissioner Jay is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| That phrase, and we run into it in law all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| and the judge sitting up there has to make a determination if there's nothing itemized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| So it's a good point well taken, but we can put in a recipe or a list of what is generally considered good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2104)|
| 0:35:14| So I understand what Commissioner Bussler says and what you say, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| So we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| With that bit of information, we move to any other rule changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| I have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Did I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2137)|
| 0:35:47| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| I have a few suggestions to review that I'm passing around today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| First one is Rule 1, Board of Commissioners, Section D speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| So I've put here how it's currently stated in our commission rules above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| and then I have essentially two proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| The reason I brought this is we don't enforce this rule at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| It says a member recognized by the chair should confine his or her remarks to the question under debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| which oftentimes we don't stick to the question under debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| But more importantly, the sponsor of a resolution may speak as often as the situation requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| And then this is the part we just don't enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| No other member shall speak longer than five minutes on the same subject in the first speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| and three minutes on any succeeding speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| We have never done that in the ten months I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| So I have two proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| One is to just strike that last line because, again, I think the chairman has discretion regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| Or the second one is to just say other members shall speak on the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| but may be limited in the number of times speaking by the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| So it's just essentially we don't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| So we shouldn't have it, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| We don't enforce it, but it needs to be there in case we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| because somebody could start filibustering and just talk forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| and keep us from voting on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Okay, but if we don't give somebody a time on the front end and they never adhere to a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| why do we have it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| Because you can say, rules say you can only talk five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| You've been talking ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I'm moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| The chairman could do that, correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| But couldn't the chairman do that without?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| I mean, couldn't the chair say, look, we're off the rails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| It's time to cut it off anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Yeah, he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Well, sometimes that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| But the five minutes is, he can call it at the end of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| It's discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| I mean, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| I just, if we don't use a rule and I just think it's cleaner to not have it, then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| I kind of like to leave it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| I think I would, too, and leave it up to the discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| You're going to find, as you sit on here, every chairman does things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| And they need to have the broad discretion to be able to run meetings the way they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| When you start taking away some of the tools that they can use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| I think you could wind up in a situation where the meetings get out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Before I was a commissioner, I've been in meetings with three different chairmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| you, Chairman Wright, and Chairman Nystrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| and not a single time have I ever said, okay, heard, we're going to limit our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| You get to talk once for five minutes and then one rebuttal for three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| It's just never been that formal, and I don't think it ever has gotten to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| Someday, maybe the next chairman will want to use that, and I want it to be there for them to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Look, this is just reading the rules and sort of coming up with some ideas and thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| And that's actually in Robert's rules, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| It's actually in Robert's rules, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| It's in Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| And here, again, I see what you're saying, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| Sometimes I think I'm sitting over there, I'm thinking, geez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| But you don't want to cut off debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| If the public doesn't like to see somebody cut off from whatever opinion they may be rendering...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| No, no, I don't want to cut off debate, but this says that you're supposed to only limit it to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| And there's times where we're not only not on the subject, but 15 minutes later, God knows where we are in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| And it's like, this is about efficiency and effectiveness of a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Well, I'll skip that one if I don't hear any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| These are, again, just ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| The next suggestion was rule one, Board of Commissioners agenda item devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| Again, the proposal here is keeping it as is, just limiting that to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| I think I've experienced in some past where it has turned into quite a long...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| Sermon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Sermon, not an opening of a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| And so the suggestion here is to propose a revision is just to add one line saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| devotionals, whether delivered by a commissioner and his or her designee, shall be limited to three minutes in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| Again, you can't really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| I mean, you could cut somebody off, but it's just sort of putting a guidepost in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| We won't get ourselves in any kind of freedom of religious lawsuit here, will we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| I mean, the actual...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| I pulled the actual R-12-7904, and it's very detailed about what we are and what we are not doing and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2424)|
| 0:40:33| So it's pretty detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| So I would make the motion to revise Rule 1, Section N, Number 8, to add the line, as written, devotionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| whether delivered by a commissioner or his or her designee, shall be limited to three minutes in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| Can I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| You're on this board, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| You are on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| There's only four of us here, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| I mean, four committees, members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair, for recognizing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| I just want to make a statement recognizing the fact that I don't want to prohibit any blessings God will give me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| but I think as I ask people to speak on my behalf, you can give the discretion to say limit your remarks to three to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2471)|
| 0:41:20| And that's typically what I acknowledge if people speak on behalf of whatever religious affiliation that they give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2480)|
| 0:41:31| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| We'll move this on to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| Next suggestion is Rule Number 1, Board of Commissioners, Section O, which is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| There's two revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| As you can see in the second paragraph, I believe it's supposed to be Pledge of Allegiance, not Pledge to the Flag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2514)|
| 0:42:03| but I wanted to just double check, is there an official term for our pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| I'd always seen it written as Pledge of Allegiance, not Pledge to the Flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| That's more of a clerical thing, so I'd love to get some guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| But the second part of it is the main part of the proposed revision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| which is employees of Knox County need to only give their first and last name, title, and department name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| The general public is asked to give their name and their home and business address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| but it seems kind of a little silly when we have department heads that come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| and they all give the same address, which is either 600 West Main Street or Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| It would just kind of clean it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| We know who they are, they're identifying themselves, and they're Knox County employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| so the public at large could certainly find out how to get a hold of them if there was some other bigger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| I agree. Sometimes we've had people actually, employees, give their personal address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| Yes, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Which I don't think is a wise thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| As far as the, is it supposed to be the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| The Pledge of Allegiance can be to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| I did do some Google searching, and it was written in four different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| so I didn't know if there was an official way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Perhaps we could move it on and double-check it between now and the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| if everybody's okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| But I would make a motion to revise Section O as written with some verification on Pledge to the Flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2607)|
| 0:43:36| versus Pledge of Allegiance before it goes to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Do you want to strike to the flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Well, I believe it's supposed to be written Pledge of Allegiance instead of Pledge to the Flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| I think it's supposed to be Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| That may be the case, too, so I want to get the proper wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| That's the way it's said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| Okay, then just go ahead and make that part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Okay, so motion to revise Section O to include the words of allegiance before of the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2645)|
| 0:44:17| and then adding the final line of employees of Knox County need to only give their first and last name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| title, and department name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| And perhaps Jill has a better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| To change this however it needs to be then, too, because that's a different other section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Give the other one another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Let's just do the flag first and employees second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| Just to keep it clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Well, it would be in the same revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| So motion to revise Section O, adding the words of allegiance before to the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| and then adding the line of employees of Knox County need to only give their first and last name, title, and department name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| Now you're saying you want the pledge of allegiance to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| You want that reversed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Well, of allegiance is not in there currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| See right above right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| This is how it's currently written and this is the proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| It just says pledge to the flag right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| It doesn't say what flag or any flag or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| I just wanted, I didn't know if it was an official term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| So that would be my motion to add this, change that, and add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| And the wording would be pledge of allegiance to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| We have a motion and a second before us to send this on to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| I don't think there was a second yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| Seconded by Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| I'm going to stop you right there before you go to your next one because Jill has pointed out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| We probably need to change the way this appears on our agenda as it says pledge to the flag on both the work session and the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| So I would make a motion that we change that to pledge of allegiance to the flag on both the work session and the regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2761)|
| 0:46:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| And the proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Next proposal is rule 7, rezoning and requests and appeals, section B, witness or citizens appearing before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2789)|
| 0:46:40| No witness shall be permitted to testify on the same matter more than once except by special permission given by vote of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| So, again, something we don't do, we don't ask the commission to vote whether somebody can have more than one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| So I would just propose changing that word commission to the chair because, again, I think the chair has the discretion, not the commission voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| We don't ask the commission to vote to give somebody a chance to come back up to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| So the revision is below just to changing the word from commission to chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| Well, it said commission chair, did it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| See above, it just ends with commission except by special permission given by vote of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| Now, if the law department tells me that is by proxy the chair, too, that's okay, but this may be just a word in cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| Here, again, I think the chair has the discretion to do it, and what usually happens on this for questions are asked on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2851)|
| 0:47:43| Gerald Green might be asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| The applicant would be asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Somebody out, one of your commissioners may, some idea hit them, and they want to ask the applicant something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| It's been pretty well, I guess, by implication, the chairman's allowed that to go on, but I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| This is saying by vote of the commission, so we would have to stop the meeting and vote every time we wanted to give somebody permission to talk more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2880)|
| 0:48:07| Would we not need to take the word vote off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| Yeah, I guess you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| By special permission given by the chair and taking the words vote of off as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2891)|
| 0:48:21| So I would make a motion to revise section B to have the second line in that paragraph say no witness shall be permitted to testify on the same matter more than once except by special permission given by the chair, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2901)|
| 0:48:36| If I might, I think the word allowed would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| Allowed by the chair rather than special permission given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| That indicates that the chairman's got to make a statement, but if he allows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| Allowed by the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| That's a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| I'm happy to revise that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| You know, again, I worry about taking away rules that are there that could be used by a chair if they chose and commissioned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| You could get into a situation where the chair just keeps recognizing people and the majority of the body of commission's ready to move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2942)|
| 0:49:10| and one of the commissioners could call before you let somebody else speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| We need to vote for them to have that right to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| Yeah, I guess I never thought about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Could you do that through a call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| That's the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| John, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I asked could we do that through a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| A call for a question is a vote to call to vote on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| It's not to stop any kind of, you know, a chairman does not have to recognize a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| That's up to their discretion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| They can just go I'm ignoring you and keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| But they can ignore if one of the commissioners says I want to vote on if anybody else can speak on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2990)|
| 0:49:59| Sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| I think he usually does that, doesn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Does anybody else have anything to say on it before he moves on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| This is not a huge one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| I mean, I just thought it was a word in cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| But if it opens up a ‑‑ if it takes away an opportunity to have everybody vote on allowing more people to speak or not, then I'm happy to move aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3012)|
| 0:50:21| Again, I'm just not for taking away some of the rules that sometimes are not fully used to their greatest potential because it's at the discretion of the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3021)|
| 0:50:33| There are going to be in the future other chairmen that will need these rules, situations that will call for these rules to be invoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3033)|
| 0:50:42| And I just think it's not a good idea to change too many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| I'll move on from that one unless anybody wants to push it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| That's it for revisions of our current Knox County rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| I have two new rule proposals to introduce to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| I think the first one, both of these have to do with committees themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| The first new rule proposal, I'll read it and then maybe summarize why I introduced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| All committees to the Knox County Commission shall meet at least one time per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| Committee chairs must submit at least one written report to the commission chair summarizing the work of the committee, minutes, agendas, proposals, and relevant information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| Annual committee report shall be turned in to the chair and the commission office no later than August 1st of each calendar year and made public in an appropriate archived form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3086)|
| 0:51:35| The reason I propose this is that in the past we've had some committees that have not met at all or very rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| And when I first came on commission, we had a meeting before our reorganization that was a sort of talk about the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3101)|
| 0:51:49| And it was not a voting or binding meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| It was more of an informal going through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| In that meeting, there were several committees that people scratched their head about why we even had the committee or when they had last met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3114)|
| 0:52:03| And there's not a lot of formality to committee meetings and actually having that information roll up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| In addition, I'm on a committee that has a lot of different information presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| The Joint Education Committee, we have proposals and information submitted by different various people of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| And so without some sort of way to roll that information up and leave it as an archive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| any new members of that committee are going to start back at zero again and that information is lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| So I think once a year before, and this really ties into the new rule proposal number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| is every year in August before we get into reorganization, we ought to, as a body, say what committees should we have, what committees shouldn't we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3157)|
| 0:52:45| what are effective, what are not effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| And let's say a committee doesn't meet for an entire year and there's no report given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| then that gives us an opportunity to say, well, why do we even have this or is it effective or should it be restructured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| Alternatively, if a report comes in that says we did all this other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| then perhaps we need to redefine a committee by saying, wait a second, you guys did these 40 things and it wasn't part of your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3182)|
| 0:53:09| So it gives us a chance once a year to kind of talk about what are the committees and what are the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| And you'll see in the, it just ties to number two, that basically in August we have an opportunity during commission and workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| to discuss what are the committees that we have instead of just sort of saying, well, that's the way it's always been and we'll kind of go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| When we get to actual reorganization time, there's no-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| That's a five-minute rule on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Okay. But let me say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| When we get to the point of doing a reorganization, there's no, we don't get the opportunity to debate whether we want a committee or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3217)|
| 0:53:45| want a committee or redefine it. We just get to who's going to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| Some of those are set by charter. Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Some are standing committees. They're always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| The education committee is not a standing committee. It's one that was appointed by the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| It's up to the chair to make it go on farther than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| So that committee you could talk about doing away with or not having it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| So, and the chair is previewed to say whether he wants that committee or not. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3250)|
| 0:54:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Yeah, that's a stand. That's not a standing committee. It's up to each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| The chair can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| The commission itself and the chair can decide if they want to continue that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| We're getting pushed up against the audit committee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| So what I would propose is that we're going to have to meet next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| because we have the item of the process for removal from a committee to vote on or decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3279)|
| 0:54:50| Now, if it's okay with you, Commissioner Jay, I would like to leave these two items until that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| and we can bring them back up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| And I would like to go ahead at this point and try to set our next meeting for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3299)|
| 0:55:07| I'm happy to move that to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| I just don't think we have time to vet them completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| I just want everybody to know I just think that it's a good practice as a governing body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| to once every year reexamine who we are, what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| and what that process is so that we are effective and efficient, not just because it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| So that's the purpose behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| What dates do we have for a possible meeting next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| We want to do it before the commission meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| In case any recommendations come out of that, it would go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| You have the 15th of July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| 15th is workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Finance committee next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Finance on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Wait just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| You have finance from Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| At 4 o'clock, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| No, we may go at 2.30 depending on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| We've been running into trouble with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| It's normally 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| Do we have to have the meeting in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Can it be in another room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| No, we can do it in another room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| But you need to make sure that the members of this committee are not tied up in meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| Well, everybody's on finance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| Everybody's on finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| We could do it earlier that day or first thing in the morning that day or noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| I'm fine with whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| But finally with what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| 15th at noon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| 15th at noon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190617Rules?start=3402)|
