| 0:00:00| May we have the grace and wisdom to act kindly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=0)|

| 0:00:04| and what is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=4)|
| 0:00:05| May we be hospitable to criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=5)|
| 0:00:07| May we never put ourselves at the center of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=7)|

| 0:00:17| the ways of our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=17)|

| 0:00:28| When someone fails or disappoints us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=28)|
| 0:00:30| may the graciousness that which we engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=30)|

| 0:00:37| through reading and creative thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=37)|
| 0:00:39| so that we can continue as a servant of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| Where the new will draw its enrichment from the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=45)|

| 0:00:55| of the appreciative gaze, the decorum of dignity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| the springtime edge of the bleak question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| May we have a mind that loves frontiers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| so that we can evoke the bright fields that lie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| beyond the view of the regular eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=66)|

| 0:02:44| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Mr. Mayor, I'd like to postpone items 12C and 12D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| for at least 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| OK, the motion is you probably, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| think you need to give us a specific date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Maybe, I think we need a specific date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| if you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| And if you need to postpone again, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| But if you want to postpone for 12 weeks, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| And if you want to add, or you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| it's obviously your call, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| we do need a specific date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Can I just postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Or you need a specific date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| I think it's postponing, it has to be a specific date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| It can be 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| It doesn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| April 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| OK, is that a Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| It's not a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| It has to be a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| If it just says 12 weeks, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Are you OK with saying 12 weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=206)|
| 0:03:26| OK, that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| The motion is to postpone, make sure I get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| 12C and D for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=217)|

| 0:04:04| To add by motion 11N and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| OK, all those in favor of adding 11N, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=250)|

| 0:04:15| OK, anything else dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| OK, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| I guess the mayor's report is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| Real quickly, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=264)|

| 0:04:45| and it's been a huge success the first two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| both in terms of numbers of participants and the fun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=287)|

| 0:06:52| department's five-year plan, which is our five-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=412)|

| 0:07:12| is a workshop on the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| I want to stress, this was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| talked about as a training for new council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| Because there is some opportunities now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| with the 10-year plan, there will be some new initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| talked about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| And I would urge everybody who can come to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| I want to apologize on the scheduling of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| It was thought of a little differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| so it's not scheduled perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| But there'll be some important stuff going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=457)|

| 0:07:54| telling me that they have reached their goal of raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| $35,000 for the school to buy active boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| And I know a lot of people around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| here have participated in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| I want to say thanks to all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| It makes a lot of difference in that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| to have that technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=486)|

| 0:08:12| Shelter is doing an event this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| I think it starts at 6 o'clock out on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| Everybody should have gotten an invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| If I had mine in front of me, I could read you the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| But it's out on Kingston Pike at a big tent near something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| Anyway, you should have that information at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=508)|

| 0:08:52| 30,000 tulip bulbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| And if everyone will be watching the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| or listening to the news, they have approximately another 30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=538)|

| 0:09:13| And I think they should be commended for doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=556)|

| 0:09:18| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=558)|

| 0:10:18| Mayor, I'd like to recognize Parks and Recreation Director Joe Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| He'd like to make some comments about this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=622)|

| 0:10:25| Go ahead, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Thank you, Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Real briefly, I just want to make aware of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| that this project is an important project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| It's been ongoing for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| We had some issues initially with TVA, but we resolved those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| But mostly, I wanted to recognize Johnson Architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| the firm that did the design for this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| They've done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| We've worked with the community and been able to make some really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| for a restroom, it's really going to be a really nice facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| a much needed facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| But normally, I don't recognize architectural firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| for the work they do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| But in this particular case, Johnson Architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| as we were having public meetings, they stepped forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| and offered their services pro bono for the design work on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| And they've done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| I've enjoyed working with Kristin Grove, who's been their primary contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| And I want to thank she and Daryl Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| who have graciously offered their services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| like I said, at no cost to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| which allowed us to really do even a greater enhancement to this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| that we're going to start construction on hopefully next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| assuming council approves this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| But I know Daryl Johnson and Kristin Grove are both in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| and I just wanted to recognize them briefly for their public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Mr. Walsh, could you ask them to stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| for those council members who might not know them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=707)|
| 0:11:47| We appreciate your service and your generosity in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| Thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Just a question for Joe Walsh before he leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Joe, it says it's to be complete by April 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| If you don't start at the beginning of March, are you going to get it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| If it doesn't rain for the next six days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Weather is always an issue, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=728)|
| 0:12:08| This time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Tell me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| But yeah, that would be our tentative date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| But we are always at the mercy of the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| We'd love to have it open for the springtime and the Dogwood Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| and all those festivities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Can't remember when it wasn't raining around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=746)|
| 0:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=748)|

| 0:13:08| I'll take it up and then put it back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Go ahead, Councilman DelVal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Yeah, if Mr. Anderson is here, would you just tell us what we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| accomplish for our $2,000,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Just give us a brief summary of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| I can tell you, but Cindy McGinnis is here, and she's the manager of Knox Air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| Transit, so if she could come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| I always think when we spend those kind of dollars, we should at least have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| information to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=811)|
| 0:13:31| Cindy, if you could start with name and title, and then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Cindy McGinnis, General Manager of CAT 1135 Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| This rehabilitation project will basically from the ground up get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| Magnolia Avenue facility up to speed, if you will, with energy improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| There'll be a new roof put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| There'll be a new heating and air conditioning system installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=833)|

| 0:14:05| Just basically everything that you can see and feel in the building will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| changed as a result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| The building's over 20 years old, and our utility costs are really quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| embarrassing at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| So we're looking forward to increased savings from this project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| Okay, so this is an update after 20 years of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=866)|

| 0:15:06| I wish Cindy had just stayed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=906)|

| 0:15:08| Go ahead, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Okay, she's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Just tell us briefly what this is so we know what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| There will be certain enhancements to the transit center project that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| funded through this pot of money, including geothermal improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| Somehow...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| I'm not a real technical person, and I wish somebody from the PBA was here, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| somehow you drill these holes into the ground, and your heating and air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| conditioning system takes advantage of the temperature of the ground in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| to cool or heat the building, so you're starting at 50 degrees instead of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| air temperature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=940)|
| 0:15:40| That's what the geothermal does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| It also provides for energy-efficient light fixtures, a green roof, high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| efficiency glazing on the windows, waterproofing systems, masonry, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| artwork, some landscaping, and some metal wall panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| I don't know who this question would be for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Maybe it's for you, Cindy, but we had heard in the prior meeting that some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| these funds that come from the federal government have a time limit on it of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Your building contract goes beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Is any of this affected by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Well, the timeline with the Federal Transit Administration was to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| get the project advanced, and this project is considered in an advanced state, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| are fine with the timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| So you don't have to worry about passing into the next fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=990)|
| 0:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=990)|

| 0:16:32| Provided that you approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| There's always a precondition, isn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=996)|

| 0:18:12| deadline you spoke to us about last council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| It is fine because we will have incurred an expense and given these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1095)|

| 0:20:05| manage the funds so that their financing works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| Is that what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1212)|

| 0:20:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Councilor Dolfi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Yeah, I don't know if Sam would answer this or Cindy again, but is there a goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| to move more in this direction of the liquid propane or is this sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| continuation of a test program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Where are we with that fuel as a source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| We currently have 24 vehicles that use propane and at one point in time, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| seemed like it was going to be an advantageous program, but as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| vehicles are aging, we are finding some severe operating challenges with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| particularly in the cold weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| And some of the manufacturers that we had that supplied some equipment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| helped the particular failure no longer provide the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| So propane is probably a fuel that we will be phasing out as these vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| are replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| And so will diesel be your primary fuel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| For these type vehicles, we are finding that the transit industry is having more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| success with unleaded right now, which is kind of surprising, but the diesel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| engines are going through quite a bit of change with the 2010 regs and unleaded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| for the short term seems to be the preferred direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| Now, that could change in two or three years, but right now, if we place these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| vehicles tomorrow, it would probably be with unleaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| So right now, you are just keeping the vehicles you have fueled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1335)|

| 0:22:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| It's a similar type of question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Again, if someone could describe this system and the experience of the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| that's going to be doing it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| As I understand reading the materials, we are going to have a much better handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| on where our buses are and how they will work in the schedule and that consumers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| and users of the bus will have information as well that will enable them to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| their bus trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Tell us a little bit about this Digital Recorders outfit and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| qualifications to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Digital Recorders has been serving the bus industry for over 20 years with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| various types of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| They've migrated into the AVL sales field some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| They have successfully completed AVL projects in Athens, Georgia, Jacksonville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| Florida, Raleigh, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| They're sort of like the Windows version of AVL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| They're probably the least expensive and maybe the less customizable, but it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| pretty bulletproof product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| And they have it successfully installed in systems throughout the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| and similar size of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Sometimes an advantage not being on the cutting edge, you know how it performs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| And for a system this size, I think that's a comfort level that we should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| attaining here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| If you could answer one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| I couldn't tell from this whether the one year of service we're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| under the warranty clause is covered by our performance bond or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| I wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| It looked like it was listed as to just the phased project items and not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| warranty service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| I don't know how significant that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| The first year the warranty is included in the performance bond would not come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| into play for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| And then the subsequent years, I do believe there was a charge for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| But the actual warranty service is not covered by the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| That's just the implementation of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| That's included in their base price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| In the base price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Councilman Newell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Hey, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Could you explain to council, because I think it's a pretty cool idea, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| Google Transit that we passed earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Google Transit is not to be confused with AVL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Google Transit is a trip planning program, and it's very similar to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| you see when you get directions on the Google web page between two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| And what happens with Google Transit is every bus stop and CATS system has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| unique location associated with it in a geocoded form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| And this Google Transit software can take your starting location address and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| your destination location address and then chart which buses you should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Meaning I can get it all on my phone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Or I will be able to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| On Google Transit, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Let me add one more thing about this AVL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| This feels like ancient history now, but it wasn't that long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| We had to, because there's federal money involved, we had to prove that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| we, Bill and I went through a lot of time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| We had to prove that we weren't, it sounds crazy with a public transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| system, we weren't adding to the pollution in the area by having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| concentration of buses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| I know it's sort of a contradiction of thought, but with EPA we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| prove that we weren't doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| One of the conditions of getting certified at this site was to have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| AVL to show that there wasn't a concentration of any kind of pollutant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| So the management of the buses showed that we weren't concentrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| pollutants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| To show that there was, yeah, good rotation, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Mayor, I had a good conversation with Ms. McGinnis this afternoon about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| the recurring costs or ongoing costs that we will incur as a result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| adding this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| And that's something that we've talked about in our budget retreat, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| as this transit center comes online, we're going to have some new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Do you want to address those items, Ms. McGinnis, and the possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| sources of funding for those ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| There will be reoccurring expenses involved with the AVL system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Primarily, the bus talks to the satellite, and the way it talks to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| satellite is over a data connection similar to your cell phone connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| and there will be a cost from the cellular provider for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| However, that is considered an eligible maintenance, capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| maintenance item under our federal funding agency, and they do provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| us with, right now it's about $5.5 million a year of formula funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| to help us offset some of these capital maintenance items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| And so the AVL system recurring expenses will be an eligible item for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| that funding, and that's funded at 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| So the city responsibility then towards the recurring maintenance for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| these systems will be 20% of the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Now, the software maintenance that's mentioned in our package is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| eligible for that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| That's all us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| I think it's our intention to use the funding for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Of course, that funding gets finite after a while, and you start giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| up other projects for your recurring maintenance, but it is our intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| to use the capital maintenance funding for the software licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1671)|

| 0:29:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| I have a question for Ms. Rojara about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| I know we designated a half a million dollars at one point to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| development, and I'm not sure where we are on the spending of that and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| there are any other funds that are obligated to support this plan at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Well, we actually have a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| A million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Oh, even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| We have a million dollars for Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| About half of that has been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| The other half, give or take some dollars, is targeted towards we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| purchasing land for a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| In order for the site to be developed at the corner that we have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| purchased and demolished the structures that were there, in order for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| to be developed, parking needs to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| So we're acquiring a lot a couple doors down for parking, and so this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| in fact, the bids are, I think, going out tomorrow, the bid announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| And so we'll build a parking lot, and there's some public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| We've worked with engineering on this and with Beth East and Elizabeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| Easton, who is the architect on the design of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| So sidewalks, public improvements in the parking lot, and also a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| loan to one of the businesses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| So in terms of how these objectives are prioritized in the plan, it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| like we have funding through the level one priorities for certain, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| with the streetscape improvements, maybe a little bit moving into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| It's already obligated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| We don't have enough money to do the whole plan, but we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| what we can with the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| And then we'll be seeking other, looking for other sources of funding to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| complete the plan as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| And how long do you anticipate the rollout of this plan being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Is it probably a 10-year vision for Vestal, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| To tell you the truth, we haven't gotten that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| We're trying to get through the empowerment zone first, and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| be able to reassess where we are and try and map out the next steps on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1875)|

| 0:31:18| Mr. O'Hara, can you tell us if the book that we have, the Vestal book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| that we have, the Vestal site improvement plan, is available on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| MPC website or on the city website so that people who are interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| maybe getting involved in that project can get the same detail that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| been furnishing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| I'm going to refer to Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| The plan is on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| I believe the original one may be on ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| I'd have to check, but I think it probably is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Elizabeth Easton Architects Design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Right, but the January 2010 one is the one on the MPC site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Right, and that's on the MPC website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| I guess two things, and I don't know if it's for Mr. Donaldson or Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| O'Hara, but I couldn't find my old plan, but my sense of one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| changes in the new plan is that the implementation section is a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| detailed, and I just wanted to say I think that's really valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| I think it's good to say here's how we're getting it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| I love, as Ms. Roddy pointed out, this was here's phase one, here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| That felt good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| I had a question on what's in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| It's called section five, form-based code guidelines, which is are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| moving forward with form-based codes, and if we are, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| Donaldson, is this a small project, a medium size, or a big project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| We are planning to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| It would be in line after Cumberland, North Central, and Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| Compared to those projects, it's relatively small because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| geography is small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| By then, we should have it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=1984)|

| 0:33:48| The current sector plan and one-year plan are not in conformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| The current sector plan is showing this area for light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| The one-year plan is showing it for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| This, by creating a mixed use, recognizes both of those uses, plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| the current zoning, plus some of the current land uses in there as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| eligible land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| So it does bring them into conformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| I guess this goes to the next item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| If this is passed, how does that impact existing zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| For example, there's a piece of property that's zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| The low density and medium density residential are two of the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| designations that we've included in the mixed use title for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| So we have respected the existing zoning while acknowledging the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| plan designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| I would move to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| We do have two folks sign up to speak to this item, and I will call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| If there's anybody here to speak in favor, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| I have two folks sign up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| First would be Ellen Adcock, and then second would be Polly Doka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Ellen, could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Can I point to Parliamentary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| This is the sector plan, not the – okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Mayor, Ellen Adcock at 3111 Ramona Avenue in the Westview Group, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| Happy to be here, but I do think Councilwoman Palmer just clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| some things for us with the answer from Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| So I'll yield this time and move down to the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| To 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Just being sure I was signed up if I needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Polly, same with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Then I have no one to send to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Ms. Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Anybody else to comment on 12E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| 12F is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northeast side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Middlebrook Pike, east side of Keith Avenue from R2 General Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| District to C6 General Commercial Park District if it's in that applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Ms. Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| We do have some people here who wish to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| And you'd like to hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Now, Ms. Adcock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Again, Ellen Adcock, ADCOCK, 3111 Ramona Avenue, Westview Area, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| First of all, I want to thank you for taking this opportunity to allow me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| speak to this and also to congratulate the new council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| I've had the opportunity to meet and work with many of you over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| And I know this is going to bring a lot of enthusiasm and energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| And I look forward to the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| But I also don't want to leave out the old council people either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| And instead of old, I'm going to put experience because Councilwoman Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| reminded me that that sounded a bit better than old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| But I know that you're seasoned and you know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| And we need you here to work with the new council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| So it's a great combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| So, again, glad to have everyone serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| And I appreciate all the time and effort you put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| First of all, I want to come and talk to you today about an address at 3605| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2225)|
| 0:37:13| Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| This is the property that we have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| It is now known as this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| And I am sure that the person who has applied for this rezoning is doing all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| she can to comply with the zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| And sometimes they're confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| And that's why we have some experts here to help us through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| I understand that she has an interest in running an antique business and used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| furniture business out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| And I certainly love all of those things myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| But when you look at the location, I'd like to point out a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I know many of you have taken the opportunity to drive by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| First of all, the location is not in the right area to even ensure her success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| If you look at it, it's tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| And as I go on through, I think you'll understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| So I have some concerns about whether she would even be successful in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| The second thing is, is it this move, this change in zoning does not sustain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| the quality of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| In fact, it would hurt it a great deal, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| This is an attempt, I think, to put a good face on a poor excuse for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| And again, I just think we're trying to put a Band-Aid on something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| never needed to exist to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| This building at one time was likely built as a small residence or actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| small garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| In fact, I have some historians here from Westview, and they tell me at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| time, years ago, this was just built as a small garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| It was never intended for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| In fact, it's totally out of the character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| And as you drive by there, you see it's squeezed in into what is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| particularly a commercial-looking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| And I wonder why we're trying to make this fit at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Actually, the TV repair shop that was there previously, we begrudgingly put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| with that activity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| And it was never something that fit in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| And a repair shop is much different than a retail experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| As you know, a repair shop, you're driving there to leave off what you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| repaired, you're coming back to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Retail, I myself would likely stop three and four times a week just to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| So what we're going to have is a great deal of traffic in a very tight, tight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| You have seen also how small the parking area is, and I know there's been some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| question about whether there can be display of furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| And I think when you get out there and look at that, you know these things will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| never come together and have enough space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Another point I'd like to make clear, again, Keith Avenue was placed as a dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| end by the state for a specific reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| And it was to limit traffic going in and out of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| This was the entire, this was why we were so excited when Middlebrook Pike was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| actually widened, is that this would make this green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| If you will notice also that there are many landscape barriers down through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| there and also green median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Keith Avenue and that area now has become a very peaceful setting, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| actually more residential than it is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| And you will note that there is even a peaceful cemetery that sits there beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| I just think that C3 and C6 are making a historically bad problem much worse, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| I would urge you actually to leave R2 zoning in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| And many of us in Westview are very concerned about where this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| take us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| And I'll be glad to answer questions, and thank you for letting me run on, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| this is something that we are very concerned about and appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Thanks, Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Westview is a member of the Council of Involved Neighborhoods, and they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| been for a long period of time, I think some time before I got here even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| And Westview has some issues that they are, they're trying to reorganize their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| neighborhood and turn it around and make it a stronger neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| And I think it's important for us to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| They're trying to reorganize their neighborhood and turn it around and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| it a stronger neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| And doing something that would undermine the direction that they're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| go, I don't think is something that council wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| I mean, we all want to take fragile neighborhoods and make them better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| instead of allowing them to totally, to decrease in the property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| And this, what happened there, the TV shop was never a nice place to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2509)|
| 0:41:57| They always had the old televisions out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| They even had the televisions out front after the shop closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| And then when they disappeared, I was really happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| But when I'm going back down the road and I see these huge tarps with whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| collected up under them, and they're as big as a piano or an automobile in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| some cases, I thought, well, maybe the television repair shop was not so bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| after all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| And these things were, I think a lot of you visited the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| So you can imagine, I mean, now it's cleaned up, it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| But if you can just visualize that same area with the five or six or seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| big blue tarps covering up antiques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| I also question why anyone would leave antiques on the side of the road with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| the blue tarp on them all week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| But this kind of reminds me of exactly what happened at Granger and Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| where they at least had a garden center for 20 years before it became a flea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| And this just went right to flea market mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| And I do think that we need to take in consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| Ellen said we need to leave the zoning the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Originally, we were debating whether C3 might be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| But we've had issues in our neighborhood with some C3 property that has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| monitored, the property that the business has not operated like they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| It's taken up to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| You know, you can only do that so many times until everybody's worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| So I really think that leaving the zoning the way it is is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Thanks, Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Mr. Donaldson, it looked like the MPC was struggling with whether or not this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| could become C3 as opposed to C6, which had the outdoor display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| Can you enlighten us a little bit about that process and the staff's view of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| At the original public hearing before the Planning Commission, which was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| December, the applicant had requested C6 because it was the one zone district in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| common with the two plan designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| C6 was allowed in both the commercial designation and the light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| The C6 fit the current plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| At the public hearing, the Planning Commission asked the staff to initiate a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| plan amendment to commercial so that C3 could be considered because C3 has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| prohibition on any outdoor display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| The C6 allows some outdoor display of incidental merchandise except in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2688)|
| 0:44:55| front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| There is a slight difference in terms of the outdoor display between C6 and C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Let me ask you, if it stayed this residential designation, what happens to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| the use of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Does that limit its use for any commercial use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| Very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| They've lost their legal nonconforming status as a commercial use in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| district because it remained vacant for a period greater than six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| Now, virtually its only use would be as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| It hasn't been residential for a long, long, long time, if ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| In your opinion, as a planner, is C3 a reasonable use of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| It would provide a use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| It's probably a better use than a residence at this particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| adjacent to Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| C3 is in play just down Middlebrook to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| It's across from Light Industrial and down from Light Industrial uses to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| east as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| So a commercial or office use seems to be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| And would office use be permitted under C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Is there someone here that's the landowner or someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Is anyone representing the property owner or the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| There's no one signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Councilman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| I have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| And I heard Ms. Adcock from the Westview neighborhood request that it was their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| preference or her personal opinion preference that this property remain R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| Under the sector plan and one-year plan amendments that we just passed previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| to this, is R2 still allowable under those mixed uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| It calls that medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| And I don't know if R2 qualifies as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Its current zoning is R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| So they would not have to change the zoning in order to convert the structure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| So if the zoning is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| The plan comes into play only if there's a request to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| So if for some reason the outcome tonight is that this property stayed R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| is that not a problem under the sector plan and the one-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| In reference to Mr. Della Volpe's question, was office ever considered a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| designation for this property, considering that it has a cemetery on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| and a church on the other side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| And might that be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| I'm also sensitive to the fact that when I drove by this property, it backs up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| to other residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| And sometimes we use office as a transitional kind of use when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| residences there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Was office ever considered for this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| It was not considered by the planning commission as far as zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| We included it in the mix of uses in the land use designations in the plan so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| that a future zoning request could consider office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| But these people were operating a business and trying to continue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| And my last question is for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| This evening, the only two options available, well, I guess the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| options available to us on this piece of property would be to pass nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| and then it stays R2, or to pass it as recommended by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| officials or board, which was C6, or C3, which was also discussed at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| But office, for example, could not be passed because it was not discussed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| the prior body, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| You could amend it to office, but if you amend it to office, you'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| send it back to MPC for their review to consider office and make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| I have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| And I apologize I didn't get to catch you today to ask you this before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| But a lot of times there is a vision for where we're going when we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| And I don't get any sense of vision along Middlebrook of what we want or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| Sometimes mixed use is a nice way to say we want some funkiness, we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| things different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Here it almost seems like we don't know what we want and we'll just sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| say as long as it's sort of anything, we're okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| And I'm wondering if I'm missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Is there a vision for what Middlebrook here should look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| The sector plan painted a vision for the continuation of light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| uses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| The one-year plan continued the existing zoning of C3 that is out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| This particular area has been zoned R2 for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| And there are no R2 type uses in the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| So there's never been an effort to rezone, to do a general rezoning in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=2993)|
| 0:50:01| area to implement either the one-year plan or the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3001)|
| 0:50:08| And with the road the way it is, I mean this is a median, this is I guess I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| would assume a major arterial or an arterial at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| Is there some level in which we want commercial on this road as a policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| On roads like this, I mean I think Ms. Adcock raised a really good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| about we closed Keith to cut down on a curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| And now we're going to put a business there that's going to have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Should we be looking at uses that would limit, that should look at this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| as a transportation corridor as opposed to a business corridor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| Certainly the plans reflect a corridor with commercial and industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| along it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| That brings into play access management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| This particular parcel is less than 7,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| So intensity of traffic is not going to be a significant issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| And when I drove by it, I felt more comfortable approaching it on Keith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| than trying to use the parking lot on the front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| I suspect that many of their future customers would do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Mr. Donaldson, when I went by this property, I was unable to ascertain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| use of the properties behind this piece of property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| And those are the ones that look like residences that are facing on Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| And Keith kind of dead ends behind this property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| It looks like from our maps they are zoned office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| Or are they still zoned R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| And do you know what their current active use is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Those parcels are zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| When I was at the property, I got the impression that they were housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| single families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| And they appeared to be set up as houses rather than apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| I guess I have a real concern with as small as this parcel is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| given any kind of commercial zoning, given the lack of direction that we seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| to have for this corridor, and the fact that there is a cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| which is open space to the west, a church almost adjacent to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| and R2 residences behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| I'd be much more comfortable with something like office that gave us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| a better sense of transition and protection for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| I know there's C3 further to the west, but without the property owner here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| I'm just not comfortable with any of the commercial designations I've heard yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| I haven't heard enough justification for that, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| I'm concerned that, as Councilman Becker and Councilman Roddy pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| that there isn't a real clear direction for this whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| And we seem to have little hot pockets of development that have been commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| or light industrial, but we do have a peaceful residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| with the three houses behind the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| and a house that's adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| And then we have the cemetery, we have some more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| and then we get into warehouses or office-type property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| So I'm very concerned that we don't really know what we're going to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| We do know that the Westview homeowners do not want the property changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| And I'm just very concerned that we change the zoning from the R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| to any kind of commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| Mr. Donaldson, just to clarify, the applicant, this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| is not the owner of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| It's the Taylor's, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| And was there ever any reference made to who owns the adjacent buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| Is it the Taylor's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| I saw that in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| I'm just scrambling around trying to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| Yeah, Christine Taylor is listed as the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| I am not sure if they're the operators of this and that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| There was a reference to a Lieutenant Brummett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| and that's probably who runs the this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| Councilman Bailey, the lease or this and that does not own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| The property belongs to Christine Taylor, and she inherited it from her grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| It was a small farm at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| So she owns the this and that piece as well as the adjacent house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| And I'm not sure, but I think she owns the three houses behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| So she has indicated in the package that it's okay with her for this to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| I've never talked with her, so I don't know other than what's in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| But I do know the owner is Christine Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| And I guess Arthur Seymour represented the applicant at the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| At the second meeting, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| And no one's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| A question for Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| No, there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Mr. Swanson, if no motion comes to the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| and there is no action taken on this item, then the zoning remains R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| There is no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| It fails for lack of a motion, and the zoning would remain what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| because you have to have action of city council to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Despite whatever might have happened previously at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| Councilman Delgado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| I think my question was just answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Let me just be sure with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| They would still be free to go back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| and discuss office or any other use of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| as the owner and the neighborhood could sort of work out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| Arguably, for a year, they couldn't go back and answer exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| But frankly, if they just go back and ask for something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| then MPC can do whatever they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| and it would come back in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Do we have the power to refer it back or simply to pass on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| You could send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| If you send it back to MPC, generally, they prefer to have some recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| from you as to why you're sending it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| rather than just because you don't want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Right now, there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Would anybody like to make one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Hearing none, we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| 12G is an ordinance approving the request of Huber Properties, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| for a one-year plan amendment from low-density residential to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| for property located on the southeast side of Lonas Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| northeast side of Red Cell Road, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3437)|
| 0:57:26| Is there anyone here to discuss this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| I have no one signed up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| I move we accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| There's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Yeah, I have some concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| And again, I didn't get a chance, Mr. Donaldson, to talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| and how it impacts the neighborhood there off Lonas Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| And my concern is right now the next couple items we've got up in Inskip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| are a neighborhood that I represent that we built an interstate through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| and an interstate through here and a railroad track through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| and a commercial corridor here and created a really small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| And over the years, it's gone downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| There's a small section that's still a thriving neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| but it gets very challenging when you're cut off like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| And I see something real similar here where we've got interstates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| and major commercial corridors and a neighborhood in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| And I'm worried because one of the things I know that as you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| the one way to avoid commercial creep is to get properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| that are turning office or commercial to face the main street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| which would be Lonas in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| And that doesn't happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| But unfortunately, this is a building that faces Red Sail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| So it gets really challenging to think once this one turns office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| how does the next one and the next one and the next one not turn office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| or multifamily residential or rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| And we don't have something going downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| I'm not opposed to passing this since this is just first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| but I'd sort of like to get some discussion with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| And it's not my district, but to get somebody out from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| to talking with folks about how we preserve this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| because it is currently a thriving neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3543)|
| 0:59:10| Mr. Becker, would you like to recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| Yes, whoever this person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I'd love to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| John Huber, 213 Fox Road, Huber Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| I'm the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| Actually, we have Polly Dolka from the Lonas Drive community here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| But I did have a meeting with the Homeowners Association out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| I spoke with Mr. Grieve about it, with Lisa Whitfield as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| And the main thing that they asked me to do when I approached them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| and requested that I wanted to convert this home into a professional office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| their main thing was can we just try to keep it in a residential look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| with reference to how the house is facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| We actually have two entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| One is directly off of Lonas Drive where most of the parking would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| But, yeah, we've gone through totally exterior-wise, cleaned up the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| You had to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| It looks great now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| I believe Ms. Dolka, if you wanted to make a comment, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| but just wanted to address those couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| How is this different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Yeah, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| We have not from Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| One of the things that currently is sitting in our law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| is a zoning change to create a new zone called R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| which is something I've been very excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| and concerned at how long it's taken to get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| And what it is is it feels ideal for what you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| because it allows office use but requires it to look like a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| which is sort of exactly what you'd want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| And the secret, one of the things that's wonderful about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| is that it is not an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| Mark, help me in with my term here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| It's not a, what's the office medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| what are those called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| Not the zones, the next level up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| It's a residential land use designation that allows office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| which I think, I know Ms. Doca was, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| one of the neighbors working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| It sounds like that would be a great thing for you to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| where you could get what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| you'd have to keep it looking like an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| and we wouldn't have a land use designation change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| that would allow the next person to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| well, office is next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| You'd still, in some level, be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| That would be sort of be perfect here, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Yeah, I mean, it would still fall into, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| I'm partly, I'm expressing my frustration at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| administration moving on something by asking you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| So, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| Point noted, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Okay, we do have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Okay, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| I'd like to hear from Ms. Doca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Mr. Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| I'd like to hear from Ms. Doca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| Ms. Doca?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Holly Doca, 4804 Tomachi Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| Mr. Huber did come to the Neighborhood Association first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| which we appreciated that because a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| we're the last to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| And we did talk about this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| and we are concerned that, like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| the interstate came through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| And, of course, I know Bob goes to church there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| so he's probably pretty familiar with that area also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| But, you know, that is on the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| even though it faces Red Cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| It's also got the entrance from Lonas Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| But our Neighborhood Association did talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| And, of course, those are concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| But we appreciate what he's done to improve the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| I have one question to Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| How many persons would be working out of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| that you're going to convert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| How many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| It's got three rooms in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| You know, so you probably think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| four at the most at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| But, yeah, on the Lonas Drive side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| there's a lot of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| It's probably, you know, I'd say a 25-foot wide access in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| And then there's actually auxiliary parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| that you can pull off and park right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| But I would say probably, you know, four-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| We're anticipating, you know, an accountant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| or some sort of professional office to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3803)|

| 1:05:20| to develop this residentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| and most of the residents in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3921)|

| 1:05:23| if it continues to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100209?start=3923)|
