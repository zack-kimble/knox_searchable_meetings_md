| 0:07:35| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Okay, and now, board members, just a reminder that you received an email yesterday explaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| several updated items on our agenda, so to go through those quickly, the updates were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| on items 10A, 11A, 12A, and 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| Item 10A is a grant contract for the TDOE EPIC grant and the amount listed on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| three of that contract is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| As soon as an updated contract is received from the state, the attachment will be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| On 11A, the term of the contract on page one was corrected to December 1, 2019, corrected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| from December 1, 2019, to November 30, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=501)|
| 0:08:29| I'm sorry, that's the, I believe that that is the window, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| So the correct window for the contract is December 1, 2019, to November 30, 2022, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| the law department made slight revisions to the lease agreement for item 12A to reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| Knox County is the owner of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| And then on, finally on item 12C, page three of the annual authorizer report was difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| to read, so it has been updated for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| Also on item 12C, several individuals are here from Emerald Academy this evening, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| out of respect for their time, I would like to propose that we move this item to the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| of our discussion, if that is, unless anyone has an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| Okay, so we will go ahead and begin with the very last item, which is 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=558)|
| 0:09:28| So we'll begin with our report from Emerald Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=568)|
| 0:09:41| John, would you like to take it away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Sure, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Shannon Jackson is out of town, and she's usually the one who does that, so I can kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| of give a brief overview of the two things you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| So the two parts, one is the five-year midterm report, it's a 10-year contract with the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=595)|
| 0:10:04| school, and we're required to have the midterm where they're at the end of the five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| and so that's the one report you see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| Narrative there as well from the charter school, they have things that they're continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| to work on, things that they have done well, that are listed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And then the other one you have is the annual review that we're required to do and turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| in by December the 1st, and that framework was one that this board has voted on to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| for the monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| It's in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Clint Sattler is here from REA if there are questions about specific to how we come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| those measures or how we calculate those measures, and again, I think the Emerald team is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| as well if there are questions specific to the charter or to their performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Do we have board members with questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| No questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| Now, Mr. Diggs, would you like to speak while you're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=663)|
| 0:11:16| Give us, just give us a brief update of kind of a summary of the year, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=676)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| We appreciate this opportunity, and we appreciate continued work with Nassau County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| Dr. Reiswick mentioned Shannon Jackson, their liaison, and she's been a big and significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| help to us in trying to make the school a better place for the scholars attending from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| Emerald Academy, and tonight obviously is a check-in at the halfway point of our contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| and we're very proud of the fact and excited to report that we're doing, we're exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| where we thought we would be at this time when we submitted application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| Are we pleased and feel like we've accomplished everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Absolutely not, but we are encouraged about the fact as a new start-up, we see it almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| a new business start-up, and five years into it, we're really encouraged about a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| of our academic gains and achievement at this time, but obviously you're a real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| We all are concerned and understand the importance of third grade reading, how critical it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| and very encouraged about the fact that this year, that our third graders, or this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| past year, our third graders outperformed the Nassau County average and the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| state average in their achievement, and we look forward to more accomplishments going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| forward, but we do appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Thank you, Mr. Diggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| All right, then we'll go back to the beginning of our agenda and review contracts one and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| two, three and four, five and six, seven and eight, nine and ten, 11 and 12, 12 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=771)|
| 0:13:19| 12, 13, 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| Yes, could we stop on 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| I don't know whether the board, I know the board has discussed naming before past boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=813)|
| 0:13:44| and so I just wanted to try to check the temperature, I guess, of the other board members on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=824)|
| 0:13:53| There's something about naming, and I'm sure, I don't know Mr. Henson, I'm sure he's an awesome guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| He's done all this stuff for Carnes, but there's just, I'm just hesitant to name things for people that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=840)|
| 0:14:09| you know, certainly when they're still in employ of the county, and I would even hesitate to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=849)|
| 0:14:19| even if he wasn't and was retired over a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| There's just something about that that's troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| It's like the Paterno fiasco at Penn State and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| Just wanted to see how we felt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| I believe the policy used to say, I don't believe it does now, but it used to say that an employee had to be out of Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=881)|
| 0:14:51| for at least five years before a facility could be named for that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| So I'm not sure exactly when or why that changed, but I believe that's the way it used to be worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| That is, in fact, not a part of the policy now, and I don't have a background on why it was or wasn't changed either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=906)|
| 0:15:16| I appreciate this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| I have to tell you I hate it because we were trying very hard to make this a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=918)|
| 0:15:27| But I do know this person and do know that he and his family have committed above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=927)|
| 0:15:35| and beyond what might be expected for this type of honor with our kids and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Ms. Tatterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| I'm just curious, Tony, I guess I'm just curious on what is the hangup with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| because that's one of my personal big goals is to become real rich and donate to a building to get it named after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| So I'm just really curious on what could be like, what is the other side of it, because that's my side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| The hesitancy that I have is just that we could, there could be something that could happen that we would go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=968)|
| 0:16:19| well, we named this after somebody who ends up being somewhat disreputable or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=979)|
| 0:16:29| And then what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| And that becomes an embarrassment for the school and for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| And I just would, I just think we ought to be more careful about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| and especially I think something like the thing Ms. Owens just mentioned would be something that would be a lot more careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| I guess, about making a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Thank you for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| I think that, oh, sorry, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| Well, thank you, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Either way, I'm not speaking for or against, but I do know that we, Mr. McMillan and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| just attended one that we had done at Clark Gibbs Elementary for a very, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1025)|
| 0:17:13| long-time member of the community who is no longer living, but still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| So I think we've kind of set that precedent, so I don't know how we deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| But anyway, I just wanted to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| So as of a month ago, we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Mr. McMillan, did you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| I can't tell you the exact year, but we did a similar thing for the former basketball coach at Gibbs, and he was retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1054)|
| 0:17:53| He's still retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| He's still living today, but I can't remember how long, whether he had been retired, you know, three years, five years, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1075)|
| 0:18:05| But he was not employed by Nosh County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| And it was relatively simple back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| This probably was probably, oh, gosh, 2007 or 8, maybe 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1095)|
| 0:18:26| I don't remember, but they were honoring a particular team at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| and then they did this as kind of the climax to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| But it's a little bit different, you know, than what you're talking about, where the person is still employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1119)|
| 0:18:47| I don't know this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| I know of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| I've never heard anything but complimentary things about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| But I do see your concern, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| And it seems, thank you, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| it seems like we should have some kind of guidelines or some kind of policy that would help us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| And I know there's a lot of, there's buildings that have been named after people that we have employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| or have just been recently employed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| And so it's been a practice of naming facilities or whatever, workout rooms, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| And I just think we need some guidance on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| So I'd like to refer it to, like, a policy meeting or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| That's what I was going to suggest, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| The policy currently does not have any stipulations or guidelines around who is named,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| who a building or section of a building is named for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| So I think that would be appropriate for a policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| because if we're going to expect not to get additional requests, we need to have that in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1189)|
| 0:19:57| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Number 14 or 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| 16 or 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| We'll move to board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| Policy A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| B is policy C230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| And just so the public knows, we have discussed these in policy reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| so there's been discussion on these policies already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| C is I370.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Do we have discussion on D, policy I441?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| E, policy I450?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| F, policy J580?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| And moving to grants, a question on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| E or F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| On D, yes, on D, I guess a question about the length of the grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1281)|
| 0:21:32| That's at least the note I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1294)|
| 0:21:44| Okay, so it's just one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| It's a one-year grant that comes from the state, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Is that correct, Dr. Reisach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| And I cruised through the grant, but I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| Could somebody kind of summarize what's in this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Dr. Reisach, would you like to speak to that or Mr. Oaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| It actually may be a joint effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| So this is an annual grant that we receive, and it is kind of split between the two departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| So Janice Cook and her team from school culture have some pieces of that that they use for, in this grant in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1343)|
| 0:22:32| two behavioral liaisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| There's a .5 psychologist, some social workers, trauma-informed specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| and then there's dollars for, like Project EU supplies for schools for some of the anti-bullying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| and things that the clubs do there with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Also, the Helen Ross McNabb Behavioral Therapist, or that contract that we discussed a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| is included in that for the secondary therapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| And that's mainly the portion that's kind of used on the school culture side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| And then there's also some security for our security for Gus and Russ's team, too, that they can speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| So on the school culture side, some of the grant is being used for salary positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Some for behavioral liaisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| I think I'm going to get this right because there was a modification to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| What I have listed here are two behavioral liaisons, a .5 psychologist, a .5 trauma-informed specialist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| and then two social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| So, you know, the typical question is, what if that grant doesn't come back next, the following year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| What will happen to those salaried employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| It's been an annual grant that we've received, and so what we have to do is submit every year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| And then, like this year, this is actually the second submission of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| So some of those, there have been some slight tweaks to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| Sometimes the state comes back in this year, and Mr. Oakes can speak to that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| They wanted some different security things in it, so we kind of vary that back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| Typically, there's other places we would probably, to be honest with you, make cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| maybe back on some materials and supplies in order to keep the social workers or things in the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| But it has been pretty standard, been an annual grant that we've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| But, I mean, there is always that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| If the grant goes away, you could lose the positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| All right, do we have questions on E, F, or G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| Okay, and we have one contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Any questions on that contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| Okay, and then regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Question on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| On the Lonsdale building, the new building, and I guess this is for Doug Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1497)|
| 0:25:06| Is Doug still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Mr. Dillingham, he's coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Sorry to roust you up, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| You know exactly what I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| I'm going to ask about the program standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| the revisions of program standards that Knox County Engineering sent over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| and just wondering about those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| if some of those would be in consideration of the new facility at Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| They will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| As you and I discussed previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| I had sent your suggestions or engineering suggestions to Brad Salisbury at S&ME,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| and I heard back from him just a couple of days ago that he didn't have any concerns with anything that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| So our plan is to implement those and insert those in our projects going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| That's just awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you, Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Any other questions on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| And so now we'll move to the item that was added, a discussion on team and Tiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| I didn't mean to dominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| I was going to say, you've asked lots of questions and added an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Let the record show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| I'll try to keep quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Everybody take note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| Go ahead, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| And this is for John Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| John, on the evaluation stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| I guess, first of all, how's it going with the Tiger, the schools using Tiger compared to team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1604)|
| 0:26:52| Are we having people wanting to get back into team, et cetera, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| Are we switching over from team to Tiger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| I'll give you some of an update from that, and if Dr. Russell has anything to add to it, I'll let him do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| So we still have the same eight schools on Tiger for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| The state was kind of in a fluctuation of people in different positions this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| so they kind of told us last year, if you may recall, that we could no longer have the two dual systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| We had to choose one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| We had Renee Diamond was in with the State Department that came to meet with us and kind of walk us through different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| They were looking at some different parts of team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| All we really wanted to do was the flexibility in the process and allow principals to choose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| So they had kind of had some thoughts with us of some things they wanted us to pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| so we took that to mean we could continue to pilot, and we did for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| They had some turnover in the department that came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| and so Dr. Russell and I probably two or three months ago had a phone conversation with the new folks at the State Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| and they just wanted us to walk through why we were running two different systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| And, you know, basically what we told them was we liked the flexibility of Tigran and schools where that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| It's the same rubric held to the same kind of instructional standards, and it just worked better for different principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| They told us they understood that, but they still want us to move to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| so they kind of put us on notice that this year would be our last year to be able to run both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| And so they also were open to the idea that we could have flexibility within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| I would say our biggest thing that we're hearing from principals and from teachers is that the rubric itself is not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| People have pretty much accepted and have learned a lot of the pieces to the rubric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| Again, it's on the process, and TIGR does allow a little more flexibility, a little more than the team process does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1722)|
| 0:28:51| So what we've kind of seen from a committee that we've pulled together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| that some of the people who are a diehard team are a very diehard team, and they love that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| and the folks who are TIGR, they really enjoy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| They like what that's allowed them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| So again, with Dr. Russell's help, our idea is to get with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| They said they'd be open for that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| I think what we'd like to do is potentially keep the rubric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| and then allow some of the flexibilities for it to be a school-by-school decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| and get the state to approve that as kind of our one model moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| So those schools that wanted to kind of continue what they're doing, they could continue to do that in both cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| So again, what we've heard from the folks on those committees is that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| the schools who really like TIGR really enjoy that, and the ones who like team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| some of them have expressed we're not interested in changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| But the state, again, has told us that this pilot can't continue moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| And I understand how some schools that are set up for a team, and they're used to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| they've run through it several times, and probably the teachers also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| their way of preparing for that is probably easier just to keep doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| So I totally get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| But I hope that we can continue to hang on to the TIGR system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| however you can manipulate that with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| It would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Mr. Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Madam Chair, yes, members of the board, John, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Just to add one note to what John said, too, but what we would like to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| we want the best of both since there is some comfort level with one or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| but there are some good features in team and there are good features in TIGR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| And Dr. Russell comes on board, what, three weeks or so, I think, full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| So what we want to do, what I like about the TIGR model, it's not a score until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| It appeals to me from the standpoint that it's a growth model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| and it's not a one-time, one-shot score for the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| It's something that builds over the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| and I know it creates a little bit more work for administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| but the administrators that are doing it really like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| So I think if we can, and the state's receptive to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| we can put a model together that does have the best of both and then proceed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| And I think that from a TIGR standpoint, it's, and again, Dr. Russell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| if you want to add anything to it, that I think teachers look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| principals look at it as a year-long process rather than a one-shot score from a standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| You know, maybe the teacher doesn't have the best day that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| or maybe the students don't have their best day that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| And so it does provide some leeway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| So that's what our goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| And when I came on board in this position several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| that was one of the goals we had was to have a model that was less intimidating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| and also would allow teachers to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| So that's still the priority for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Did I hear you say that this is the last year we can do both models?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Correct, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| The state always asks for districts to pick a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| And we have been given the leeway to be able to have a pilot in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| And so, again, the folks who were there had kind of told us the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| But when we met with them, were willing to give us another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| And then the changeover, they kind of told us, you know, we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| and we're glad you all are piloting those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| and learning, to Mr. Thomas' point, some things that may inform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| And they expressed at that point that they'd be willing to have conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| about the flexibility in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| because that's really what we're talking about, as Mr. Thomas alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| So we do know at the end of this year the dual system of Tiger Team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| we won't be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| So it may end up being that we're a team district with flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| with some Tiger process or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| That's kind of what we'll, when Dr. Russell comes on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| we'll continue to finish those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| So I heard you say that they said this is the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| and then I heard you say they're going to give us a year of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| So are we actually looking at roughly a year and a half then before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| No, sorry, this is our year of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| This is it, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| We kind of had, they were kind of silent while they had some changes in the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| so we hadn't really hear anything for kind of over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| And so we moved forward with assuming we could continue to pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| And so early, I guess maybe August, sometime around there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| we had the conversation and they kind of told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| put us on notice for this year being the last time we could have dual systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| but they'd be open for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| So are we looking at something that's going to create a retraining, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| of principals and evaluators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I mean, again, the big lift on the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| when the initial change to team happened was really around the rubric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| understanding, you know, kind of what expectations were around different indicators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| and kind of what they mean and what the look-fors in the classroom were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| So that was really the heavy lifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| The process is something I think Dr. Russell can do in a couple afternoon kind of sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| with the staff to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| It's really more about, you know, when, to Mr. Thomas's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| how they document things, when the scoring happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| like those kinds of flexibilities that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| So it's not a very heavy lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| And I would, and I know that you all will do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| encourage you to complete that as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| just so that everyone that isn't affected by the process has plenty of heads up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2074)|
| 0:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| And actually, I definitely thank you for advocating with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| that we could continue that pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| And I've heard nothing but positive things about TIGER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| So I would join in to say that I would like to see a shift to that evaluation in the future also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| And it's nice to hear that it won't be a huge transition if that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| We will move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| There is no one on public forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Do we have anything else on the team, TIGER?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2129)|

| 0:35:32| And no one on public forum, so we'll move to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Ms. Sutterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| I just want to say that I really enjoy the political that happened Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| And so I'm grateful for our community for creating something like that for us to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| And I'm grateful for Knox County Schools for allowing coding to be taught in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| And I look forward to continuing to support that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2156)|

| 0:35:58| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the staff and the players that Gibbs High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2165)|
| 0:36:18| School on their victory last Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| I've been around sports, Gibbs High sports, since 73, which is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2182)|
| 0:36:31| And we've won a lot of things out there through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| But in this particular case, it was, in my opinion, it has to be the largest or greatest victory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2196)|
| 0:36:51| of the football program because they defeated a team that won the state last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| I realize that it's a different team, but they're a lot of the same players and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| And the fact that they held what had been up to the last couple of weeks a pretty high scoring offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2223)|
| 0:37:12| they held them scoreless the second half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| So I just want to congratulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Well, they deserve recognition, Patty, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| You know, we seldom do stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| So they go to Upper East Tennessee this Friday night and wish them luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Well, Friday night was not as spectacular as I thought it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| On a completely different note, I do also appreciate the event Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| I was really impressed by the skills that the students had and the fact that they gave up their morning off to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| And also, and I know it's not a name on a building, but they did send me back with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| which is apparently artwork that Ms. Satterfield did with her middle school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| So maybe you could put this on the wall until you get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| You can put her name on it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you, Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| I was also able to attend the Politico event on Tuesday morning, and it really was a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| And we had lots of great kiddos there, and so it was just fun to see some of the things that they're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| So I was thankful to be able to attend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| And so I would just encourage everybody to see what's going on in your schools this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| because there's a lot of fall festivals going on and lots of ball games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| and lots of fun ways that we can support our schools and build communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| And I think there's nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178191127nov06?start=2333)|
