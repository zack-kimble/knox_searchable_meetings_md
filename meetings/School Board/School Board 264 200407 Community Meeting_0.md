| 0:00:31| Good afternoon, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| I'm Bob Thomas, superintendent of Knox County Schools, and I'd like to welcome you to our virtual community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| To my right this afternoon is Mr. Ron McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| Mr. McPherson is assistant superintendent and chief finance officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=41)|
| 0:00:45| And to my left, Dr. John Ryswick, assistant superintendent and chief academic officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| And also joining us this afternoon is Noah Kelly, our student board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| So good afternoon, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| In a moment, I'm going to turn things over to our moderator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| but first I'd like to thank all the students and families who participated in today's event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| This has been a challenging time for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| and I know that our families have many questions about how the extended closure will affect their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=67)|
| 0:01:13| Hopefully we'll answer many of those questions this afternoon, but before doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| I just want to thank all the district employees who have worked so hard to make our KCS at Home initiative a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=77)|
| 0:01:25| Our teachers, principals, and central office staff have done a great job of crafting this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| and I'm confident it will help our students maintain the academic gains they've already made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| and be prepared when classes start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| With that, I'd like to hand things over to Noah Kelly, who is our moderator this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| Noah is a senior at Carnes High School and is our student representative for the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| Noah, why don't you get us started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| I'd like to begin with a question which was sent in by Henley Hodge, a second grader at Fountain City Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| Henley would like to know how students will advance to the next grade after missing so many days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| and whether or not summer school will be a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| Thank you for your very insightful question, Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| I know a lot of people are wondering about summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| The first thing to point out is that the state legislature voted in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| to allow the Tennessee Commissioner of Education to waive the requirement for 180 days in a school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| So if we don't make it to 180, we don't have to make up those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| Our district is developing a plan to cover any learning gaps caused by this extended closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| Knox County Schools already offers some summer programming each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| It's mostly centered around literacy for the elementary grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| and academic support, remediation, and recovery credit for middle and high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| We will keep families informed if there will be any additional summer learning programs offered this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| Some families have also asked whether students will have to repeat the current year or current semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| I'll just say that whatever strategies we pursue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| all students who are on track to move on to the next grade will not be penalized by this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Our next two questions are related to high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| First, can you tell us how the closure will affect high school credits and GPAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| particularly for students who are applying to college?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Let me start by acknowledging that we understand this is not the senior year our 12th graders envision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| nor is it a year that any of us envision, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| We're so sorry these circumstances have interfered with this important milestone in your life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| but we appreciate the maturity our seniors have shown through this health crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| and are hopeful that they will soon get to experience some of the celebrations they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| On April 9, the Tennessee State Board of Education has called an emergency meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| to address many issues such as the effect the extended closure is having on this year's senior class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| Knox County has developed an internal plan in preparation for the decisions made on the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| and we're hopeful that we will be able to communicate that plan soon after the State Board meeting on the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| As a follow-up, can you tell us the status of graduation ceremonies in May and what will happen with proms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| To date, we have postponed all proms that would have occurred during the dates of the extended closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| We're continuing to discuss graduation with our venue and will make the best decision we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| given the concerns about public health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| As a district, we remain committed to exploring ways to restore some of these important experiences when this trial passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| We will communicate any decisions as quickly as they are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| My final question to you, Mr. Bob Thomas, is about the decision to limit KCS at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| to material that was already covered this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Several people have asked why the district decided not to provide any new instruction during the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Can you help parents understand why the district made that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| Yes, thank you, Noah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| We need to be clear, the best way to ensure safety in the current health crisis was for the district to close its schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| But during this closure, we are offering high-quality educational resources to families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| to reduce the learning loss for not being in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| Our teachers can also reach out to their students and provide supplementary materials for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| And we have some complimentary videos for grades K-8 that are available on our KCS YouTube channel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| and our KCS Comcast channel 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| Additionally, East Tennessee PBS is airing standards-aligned instruction lessons for grades K-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| Unlike some smaller and more resourceful districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| KCS does not have the ability to ensure every student has a laptop and Internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| Therefore, to ensure equity, we cannot go completely to an online distance learning format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| and require new learning at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| However, for high school students enrolled in credits or credentials for post-high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| such as dual enrollment, advanced placement, international baccalaureate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| industry certifications, and statewide dual credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| those courses will allow new learning to take place since the learning is offered by an outside entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Next, I'll turn to John Ryswick, the district's assistant superintendent and chief academic officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| Dr. Ryswick, I have a general question and a little bit more of a specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| Many families have asked what the district is doing to make sure that children don't fall behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| More specifically, some of those families have pointed out that in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| the material covered this year is necessary for next year's classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| For example, a student who's enrolled in French 1 will not be able to or be prepared for French 2 next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| How will the district ensure that students are prepared for the next school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| Thank you, Noah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| I just want to say, as the superintendent said, again, this is unusual time that we're facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| so a great question to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| Our hope right now is that we would return to school this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| I know that decision still hasn't been made, and we're monitoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| But if we were to be able to return to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| I think there's a plan that we could potentially use some of that time to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| We have, in the meantime, yesterday we launched KCS at Home, which is on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| If you're hearing this and you haven't been part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| it's also available at 28 of our sites that we use for food and also for paper packets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| for folks that don't have Internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| What that is is high-quality instructional material that's been put together by teams of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| and our subject supervisors here in Knox County Schools that cover material that's been previously recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| I think one of the concerns during this time is the learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| If we look at the last day we attended school that was prior to spring break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| until now we've missed approximately 25 days of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| So, of course, that retention of what we've learned already is something that's extremely important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| So we think that these packets and these high-quality instructional materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| coupled with what the superintendent mentioned about our partners PBS telecasting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| and also us being able to have those on our website, on our YouTube channel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| and also through our CTV, will give students a chance to be able to have exposure to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| If we were to come back, another decision that was made by the state was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| we would not do state end-of-the-course testing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| So if we are able to return to school, that testing period is usually in about mid-April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| And after that, there's usually the time it takes for that window, two to three weeks, we lose instructional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=514)|
| 0:08:42| So our thought would be with those tests not being there, if we come back to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| we could use that time instead of assessing to actually cover material that wasn't covered for this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| Even if that doesn't happen, and for some reason, because we know it's a possibility that we wouldn't return this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| And if that is a possibility, then our teaching and learning team and our subject area supervisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| are already working on plans on what that could look like to prioritize different standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| The ones that are most essential for students who move on to those, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| moving into French I, moving into French II, what's essential learning that hasn't been covered yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| So we could prioritize those in our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| As Mr. Thomas said, be that an extended time, be that the use of how we use the fall when we come back next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| But we know there's going to have to be some additional time spent on that by our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Another question that's been raised frequently is about students who got off to a slow start in the current semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| were working hard to raise their grade, but weren't able to bounce all the way back because of the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| How will the district determine what grades a student receives for the current semester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| Another great question, Noah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| I know a lot of folks have asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| So we're kind of in an interesting situation because, if you know, folks know this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| in Knoxville we faced some flood and some illness and even missed some days after we came back off winter break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| So even the third quarter, if you will, the year's divided up into three quarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| the second quarter ending right before winter break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| and then the other one typically ends right before spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| We had missed some days in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| So what we're looking at for that is how would we figure their grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| And there's a state board meeting that is Thursday, and we're hoping that they'll provide guidance on that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| We actually know that that's part of the decision making that they'll make at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| And what we expect out of that is that two groups will have decisions from two groups of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| One will be the seniors, as we talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| What we do for them in a graduation situation and as they close out their time with Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| but then also everyone else who's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| So there will be guidance from them coming at that point on what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| So we will communicate that out to our families as soon as we know that on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| And that meeting is from 3 to 5 on Thursday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| My next question for Dr. Reiswick is about KCS at home and its accessibility for parents who work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| What can a parent do if they are unable to pick up assignments at 10 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Lots of challenges when you try to figure out that schedule of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| With the community guidelines around limiting exposure and to be safer at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| the things that we're dealing with with our local health department and our governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| what they've put out for guidance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| One of our goals was how do we limit that exposure time to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| So we already had the food distribution that was happening between 10 and 12 on Mondays and Wednesdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| and some on Fridays, but we're moving to a Monday-Wednesday schedule for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| And so we decided we would just also have the paper packets available at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| so a family who needed that could stop by and not have to be exposed to more people than necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| So what we would say first of all, our option is the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| I think lots of folks have exposure to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| All of those things are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| All of those resources are available there for them to be pulled down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| That's probably the quickest and cleanest way to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| The other would be, as I just referenced, to go to one of our food and packet sites on Mondays and Wednesdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| between 10 and 12, and then there are some families that neither one of those are an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| and we want to make sure we're able to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| That's probably going to be on a more individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| And so what we would ask is that those families either call, I'll give the number now, 865-594-1800,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=742)|
| 0:12:31| or they could email the site or the address that we have set up specifically for questions for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| which is kcsat, so I'm going to say kcsat, so at home, H-O-M-E, at knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=757)|
| 0:12:47| We've gotten a number of questions about Kindergarten Roundup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| Can you tell us more about how families can enroll their students in kindergarten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| We're talking about most of these questions so far about families and students who are currently in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| but the rising kindergartners and pre-K students are ones who are yet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| So first let me define what Kindergarten Roundup is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Kindergarten Roundup is the time in the spring where rising kindergartners come to their school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| that they would be zoned to be kindergartners at, and they get to meet the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| they get kind of exposure to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| and also parents fill out paperwork that's important for them to enroll in kindergarten for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| So typically those meetings are set up in mid-April, and obviously due to the crisis, those have been canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| Our current plan right now is that we move that to May 12th in hopes that we'll be back in school to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| Some schools have chosen May 14th in combining their pre-K with their Kindergarten Roundup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| and so we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| If families want to go ahead who have a student who would be a rising kindergartner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| and want to access the paperwork that they need, you can go to our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| to our elementary school site, and that information is there for the enrollment packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| if they want to go ahead and pull that down and kind of get ahead of the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| That's available at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| At this time, I'd like to ask another topic that's come up pretty frequently involving student supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| Generally speaking, what is being done for special education students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| So the first thing that we want to be very clear about, and we've kind of talked about this in some of the other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| is that our stance and our response as a district to this health crisis has been to be closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| and the superintendent explained that well earlier about just our ability to be able to provide devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| and guarantee Internet access really limits us making mandatory assignments and that sort of thing possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| So that's why we are closed, and, again, from your previous question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| that's why it is review of material that's already been covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| And then on top of that, it's voluntary for students to be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| We've gotten an overwhelming response from yesterday through social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| and other places that parents and students are kind of happy to have the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| and to be able to work on the learning that they had already learned in the semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| and be exposed to some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| So then we talk about our students who may have IEPs or 504s, looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| So we understand that's a population that we have additional opportunities to provide some additional supports to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| So there is a student support packet that's on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| that just gives families who may have a student who needs some extra support some ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| or some ways that they may work on some modifications and things just generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| And, again, let me be clear, in no way do we think that replaces a student's IEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| or replaces what the teacher's there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| It really meant to be a resource for families to be able to use to support their student who may have those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| In addition to that, our student supports department has sent an additional communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| to families of students with 504s and IEPs offering some additional suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| And then our special education teachers, who all of our teachers are working to support students right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| they are reaching out individually to families to see how they can help with these voluntary packets and resources as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=966)|
| 0:16:13| That being said, will there be any assistance with IEP goals and therapy needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| Good question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| So I hate to sound like a broken record, but I'll have to repeat again that our strategy has been to be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| and provide educational resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| So under that, Knox County Schools is not required to follow all of the pieces of the IEP during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=989)|
| 0:16:38| It's been a real challenge for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| We're not taking that lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| We're still continuing to try to reach out and support families and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| As far as IEPs, I'll take that question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| So we do, the federal government has come in with some guidelines around how those can be done remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| So to the extent possible to renew things like IEPs and those kinds of plans as they come due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| we're reaching out through and try to schedule those remotely through different platforms to be able to schedule those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| We understand that not every family can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| And where that's possible, we're trying to work with those families, trying to update the IEPs that may need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| Case managers are reaching out to those families as well to work through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| And by and large, families have been able to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Again, we're not providing those services because we're closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| but we're still updating the documents that need to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| As far as therapy goes, a lot of that is organizations that we partner with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| And so case managers from those organizations are reaching out to students who have those therapies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| and seeing how they can provide, again, support for the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Because of the guidelines that are there from the governor and from other elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| it's not possible for face-to-face interaction to be happening right now just for the public health and safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| But they are still reaching out to try to provide supports for the families as best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| My final question for you, Dr. Wisewick, is along the same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| IEP meetings for this government did relax some of the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Typically, those meetings happen face-to-face, and obviously we can't do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| So there is the possibility of doing those remotely, and to the extent we can schedule those, we have been doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| It's very important for us that parents be involved in that because an IEP team really is a school team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| as well as the parents helping inform what's best for that child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| And so we're trying to do that everywhere we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| In the event that there's obstacles not to do that, when we return to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| we'll try our best to get those face-to-face meetings scheduled so that parents can have input in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Next, I'd like to bring in our other assistant superintendent, Ron McPherson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| who is also the chief financial officer for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| With all the public health measures like social distancing and stay-at-home orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| potentially slowing down the economy, what impact might this have on the school district's larger budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| Thanks, Noah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Yeah, that's a very important question because a significant portion of our school operations are, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| funded by sales tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| And it's quite likely that over the next several months, with the stay-at-home order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| and the people quarantining and so forth, a lot of events canceled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| it's quite likely that sales tax will experience a significant reduction due to reduced consumer spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1171)|
| 0:19:40| The question for us is, how much will it suffer and for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| We're in a unique situation right now as we're in the process of developing a budget proposal for the next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1186)|
| 0:19:55| But there's a lot of unknowns right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| So I think likely all school districts in the state, across the nation even, are experiencing this same dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1198)|
| 0:20:08| Can you say at this point whether there will be any budget reductions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Well, as you know, we've made a commitment to continue to pay our employees through the remainder of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| regardless of the duration of closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| However, because sales tax dollars likely will not be at normal levels over this time span,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| we are faced with continuing to meet obligations without sufficient revenue coming in to meet those obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| That's what we're expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| So there's going to be a gap in funding there and the only way to make up that gap for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| is to fund the difference through our rainy day account, our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| It's akin to a savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| Now again, the question for us is how long this situation will last and how quickly can the economy bounce back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1255)|
| 0:21:04| Obviously, our rainy day fund is not unlimited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| This is not a good option for meeting recurring obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| And so we can't continue to meet our obligations for the next school year with a limited amount of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1277)|
| 0:21:30| And so again, it's how do we determine or predict what will happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| It's very difficult at this point because economists even differ on this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| I think it's vital that the economy bounce back, as I've mentioned before, to at least somewhat normal levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1306)|
| 0:21:55| if it takes the hit that we're expecting over the next several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| So I think it's probably at this point a bit premature to even speculate on what, if any, budget reductions we will have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1319)|
| 0:22:08| I do think it's fair to say that at best we will be looking at what I would call a continuation budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| or it's a static level budget going into next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| I do want to emphasize that, again, it's likely that that is the best case scenario, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| And if so, that would mean no new initiatives for the upcoming budget year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| since the funding likely just won't be there to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| But we're continuing to try and gather as much information as we can to help us make informed decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| as we go through the budget development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| As we wrap up, I'd like to ask Superintendent Thomas two questions related to the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| First, what are the chances that the rest of the school year will be canceled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| And second, do you anticipate that the next school year will start early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| Unfortunately, Noah, we don't have any concrete answers on all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| Regarding the remainder of the school year, I'll simply say that we continue to monitor the public health emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| We'll continue to work closely with our Knox County Health Department and other officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| as we make a decision about the rest of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| I would also point out that Governor Lee previously asked that Tennessee school districts close through April 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| And we'll continue to monitor any guidance that's provided by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| As for next year, I would just reiterate the state legislature action allowing the Tennessee Commissioner of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| to waive the mandatory 180 days required for a school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| This removes the requirement for schools and school systems to make up the days needed to reach 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| As mentioned before, the district is developing a plan to help cover any learning gaps caused by the extended closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| This includes working with the State Department of Education to develop the best plan for covering any gaps in learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| for students due to the extended closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| And finally, I would point out that any changes to the school calendar would take action by the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| And we would communicate if the Board of Education makes any changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| we would communicate that to families as soon as that decision is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas. Is there anything else you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| Thank you, Noah. Once again, I'd just like to thank everyone who participated in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| We're trying very hard to be transparent and responsive as people have questions and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| And I'm grateful for all the students and families who have provided feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| I've worked for this district for more than 45 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| and this is one of the most stressful and difficult situations that I've ever been a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| As we read the headlines and watch the news, all of us are wrestling with anxiety about this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| We're trying to manage its impact on our daily lives and the activities that we enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| But I also want to say how inspiring it has been to watch the KCS family and our partners in the community pull together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1492)|
| 0:25:00| and care for our students during this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Our school nutrition workers have gone above and beyond to provide healthy meals for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| and so many of our teachers and administrators have volunteered to help distribute them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Our partnerships with CAC and other organizations have also been a tremendous help, and I am so grateful for their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| Since the closure on March 23rd, our school nutrition department workers have prepared 159,770 meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| for distribution by our volunteers and partners. This has been an incredible effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| And I want to thank all of our employees who have been involved in that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| And this week, I've been so proud of the teachers, principals, central office staff, and others who have implemented KCS at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1541)|
| 0:25:49| I know this is not a perfect solution. It's not intended to replace a teacher in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| And we all look forward to the day when school will be back in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| However, I believe this initiative is already making a difference for our students and our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| and I'm grateful for all the work that made it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| In closing, I just want to remind everyone that we will continue doing our best to support students as this health emergency unfolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| You will be seeing more messages from our office in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| and our social media channels will be providing updates as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| I'd like to ask everyone to stay safe, to embrace social distancing, and to pursue healthy practices, including regular handwashing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1581)|
| 0:26:30| If we all work together, we can help flatten the curve and stop the spread of this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| As our administrative team has worked through this crisis during the last three weeks, we have grown stronger as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| I am confident that our school system will emerge stronger than ever once this crisis is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| Our teachers and principals care for and love our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| and they will do whatever it takes to ensure that any gaps in learning content will be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| so that your child will be ready to advance and will receive the very best learning opportunities that we can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| I would encourage us all to continue to stay positive, to care for one another, and to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| Also, it's extremely important that we take care of our families' spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical needs as well as our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1631)|
| 0:27:19| Before we close, I want to thank the members of our Board of Education for their commitment and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| Our Board always puts students first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Please know, for me, it's an honor and a privilege to serve our students, our families, and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| Thank you for watching and for your continued support of Knox County Schools. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264200407communitymeeting?start=1656)|
