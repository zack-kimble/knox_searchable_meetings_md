| 0:06:35| having an opportunity to present tonight. I just wanted to give you the rundown of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| what we're going to be doing this evening. We're going to start with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Public Safety Director, Brent Seymour. He's going to do our quarterly Fire and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Technical Rescue report, followed by the Executive Director of Knox Emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| Communications District, Brad Anders. Brad is going to be giving us an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| on merging EMS dispatch services into Knox 911 services, and then finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| we're going to have Josh Spencer, the Regional Director of AMR, with our very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| first quarterly EMS update. So I will turn it over to Brent to get us started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair and Commission. Brent Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=433)|
| 0:07:22| 505 Summer Place, Knoxville 37902. To see the report, it looks just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| different this quarter than it did because it's actually a four-month report so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| could line up with AMR and our 911 partners as well. So about 7,800 runs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=454)|
| 0:07:42| which is pretty typical for that. We're just getting a little bit busier every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| time we report. About 62% of those are our medical runs in nature and the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| are fire and what we consider other hazmats, non-emergencies, things of that nature. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| halls and continues to be our busiest area of the county. Closely followed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| the dry gap bricky community out there. That area of the county is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| increasing. We're seeing that increase significantly in call volume as we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| forward with those. Our Karns partners put a new rescue truck in service at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| end of last month. It's a great piece of equipment to have out there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| complement their service provision already. Handles a variety of technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| and other specialty rescue type incidents. A beautiful truck. Tickled to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| death to have it out there in that community and we look forward to using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| that and having it available as we need it. Our Knox County Rescue Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| partners deployed to Sumner County to look for a child earlier in the quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| They spent a couple of days out there. You can see the data there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Over 500 acres in the woods there in Sumner County. I believe that child was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| eventually found but I think our partners had left already after they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| did the services that way they were asked to do. Real Metro, something we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| really tickled to have. Real Metro installed a baby box in their halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| firehouse. At the time that box was installed there were only four in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| state and two of those are located in Knox County. One at station 17 and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Knoxville Fire Department and obviously one in halls. I think since then Clinton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| Fire Department has added one as well. I believe I had heard so that would make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| total of five in the state. 142 of those boxes across the country in 11 states so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| we're pretty blessed to have that resource for our folks in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| I think to date through 2023, 42 infants have been surrendered through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| system in the 11 states where those boxes are located. Our Seymour Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=594)|

| 0:10:04| support of some a resolution that was developed here and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Commission that dealt with ISO and insurance ratings. And then our Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=608)|

| 0:10:23| Committee. John Linsenberger will be the vice chair and Director Anders will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| the finance subcommittee chair as well. And I'd be remorse without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| saying we're excited for the possibility of two additional seats on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| committee. An at-large commissioner and a representative from our EMS provider. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| think that will greatly expand the knowledge and and effectiveness of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| committee and we look forward to hopefully working with those two folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| Thank you. Any questions before we move forward? Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=653)|

| 0:11:06| Communications District for Knox 9-1-1, 605 Benard Avenue. Tonight we've come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| talk to you a little bit about the process that we're following to merge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| EMS dispatch services into our line of services that we have. It's a quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| cumbersome pattern to to follow. We have to train new employees that come either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=685)|
| 0:11:34| from AMR dispatch and communications into our system. We also got to train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| some of our call handling people to administer emergency medical dispatch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| protocols if necessary. We have to spend, or we are in the process of, we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| process of doing all this, but the steps that we have to take are we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| spend a little up close to a million dollars in equipment for radio and phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| apparatus for inside the call center. We got the old call center that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| currently working in, the main call center we're currently working in, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| new call center that we had had built for backup and tertiary purposes. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| had to modify that. So five new radios, three new phones, that runs almost a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| half a million dollars in that facility and it will have to do the same thing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| the other facility. And so we're looking at almost a million dollars in equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| that procurement has already been conducted. We're waiting on delivery of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| the last five pieces. And the most difficult thing to do will be to train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| our employees, their employees, and maintain the same level of service that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| the community expects. And so we're gonna have to potentially bring those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| folks in as part-time employees on their days off from EMS dispatch, train them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| pay them, and train them as our part-time employees, and then merge that system. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| to do this, this is a very, like I said, a very cumbersome process. We're adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| about 20 or 22 employees to our payroll. The county will increase their payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| to us over a three-year period. But this should take, you know, with good, great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| planning, it should take over 12, 16, to 18 months. We're gonna try to do that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| less than 12 months from the time the contract was signed. That's our goal, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| to have that done by the end of this calendar year, if not before. So, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| have any questions or comments, snide remarks? No? Sounds exciting. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| Thank you. Hello, please come forward and identify yourselves, and welcome to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=818)|
| 0:13:50| first report. Good evening. This has been about 112 days in the making, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| excited to be here. My name is Josh Spencer. I'm the regional director for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| 10,140 Gallows Point Drive, Knoxville. I want to quickly introduce some of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| colleagues here with me, as well. Here's going to drive my presentation today is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| our administration chief, Jeff Edwards. Bernie Hayes is our deputy chief of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| non-emergency division. April Kaywood, deputy chief of our 9-1-1 division. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| this is a battalion chief, Justin Blanton, who's actually on duty. So, if he gets a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| call, he'll step right up. And then, I think everyone here knows Jerry Harnish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| and Jerry is kind of wearing two hats right now for us, as the fire and EMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| chief over rural metro and AMR. And we'll talk a little bit about that structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| here in just a minute. So, but before I get, well, part of the first part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| presentation, we have about a two-minute video. We talk a lot about Knoxville 2.0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| and what does Knox 2.0 kind of look like. And so, we thought it might be best to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| kind of hear some of that in our own, in some of our team members' own words. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Jeff, if you want to play the video, then I'll come right back up after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Thank you, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=894)|
| 0:15:24| Population here in Knox County is growing by the day, and we are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=924)|
| 0:15:36| excited to be a part of that future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| We're implementing new tools. We have a new clinical-based contract, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| an opportunity to be one of the best EMS systems in the nation for one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| best counties in the nation. With the world and technology advancing, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| implemented a couple new technological programs. One is our nurse navigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| program. Redoing the way that we respond. We are redoing the way that the calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| get coded in. There's more options available to the community versus just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| an ambulance transport now. We have the option to come into their home, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| can speak with a doctor. You can speak with a nurse over a phone. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| going to save these people from having to go sit at a hospital in a waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| room or a hallway bed for an extended amount of time if they don't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| meet the criteria to go to a hospital and don't need to. And you can have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| doctor's appointment or emergency room visit in your living room. We also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| telehealth that we can use out on the road where we come into your home, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| maybe you don't need an emergency department. We can get you a specialty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| appointment lined up. We can do a whole number of things through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| telehealth system while saving you a trip to the emergency department. With the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| advancements in technology and everything that we can offer here at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| A.M.R. Knox County, our transport rates are decreasing because we're able to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| someone handle that patient care that's not an EMS provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1016)|
| 0:17:07| The RMY Ulearn program is fantastic because it allows individuals to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| here and get a sense of what exactly working in EMS is. We pay for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| schooling. We pay while they're in school. And when they graduate and pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| all the appropriate tests and everything, they have a full-time job on an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| They can build off that because of A.M.R.'s capabilities. They can progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| into advanced EMT school, paramedic school, critical care paramedic school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| And if one day they decide that they want to be a flight paramedic, they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| do that because we have those avenues available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| We do help out with education with the other agencies in the county. Throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| the year, we do training with Rural Metro Fire Department and Knoxville City Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Department. Well, it's extremely important because we feel like that partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| really provides the basis for us to be guarding to the community, certainly with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| the first response aspect and then the triage and transport aspect. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| just great to get to know those people because once you get to know those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| people, you all work really well together. The whole process here and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| point of the Knoxville 2.0 is the future is changing and we're changing with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| which is something that is going to be extraordinary once it's all put into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| There you go. All right, now the easy part. I can just push a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1104)|
| 0:18:38| button from now. So one of the challenges that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| it was no secret, is staffing and workforce. And I backed all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| up to October just to really show a good progression in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| although the new contract started in February. It was awarded in November, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| that really gave us the opportunity to really start ramping up staffing as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| quickly as possible. Now, our staffing, the process, once they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| into a new employee orientation program, it takes about two months to kind of get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| them through the entire process and all the onboarding and the training. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| have seen since October a 31% increase in our staff. So we went from 178 EMTs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| and paramedics up to nearly 240 through the end of April. We also did some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| operational structure changes in January early in the year to really kind of get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| us back kind of reorganized and restructured. One of those came with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| truly a reclassification of what we call our supervisors and lead staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| Historically, we've just called them supervisors or managers. Now, again, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| part of the collaboration with fire and law enforcement, now that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| classification that we have changed to deputy chief, battalion chief, lieutenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| to follow that same command structure, and we believe that'll help really draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| the pieces together a little bit closer in the form of collaboration. We did a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| pretty substantial wage increase in March of this year. We are a union shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| so I had to go through some of the process there, but as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| subsidy we spoke of often was to really get, you know, to bring our wages up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| so we can really recruit and entertain the best talent in the community. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| here's kind of a breakdown of our total unit hours and our total transports. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| you look at the blue and the gray line, you're seeing a really sharp increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| That's really because of the staffing, right? So the unit hour is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| ambulance on the road in the system equals one unit hour every 60 minutes. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| in the month of September, and again looking back a few months to kind of get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| the timeline and the trend, about 9,300 unit hours what we're deploying. At the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| end of April we deployed almost 12,000, so that's a pretty substantial increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| in unit hours. What that does is when the blue and the gray line get further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| apart, that gives our crews adequate rest, they have adequate downtime, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| we've staffed to a level where we feel like we need to be staffed to meet some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| meet the contractual requirements while giving our employees the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| downtime. The 911 call volume has increased dramatically. That's no secret,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| all right? Everyone knows that the population changes, the growth, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| seasonal things. There's always more and more calls are coming into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| but as well as I think one of the crew members mentioned in his report, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| transport rates are actually decreasing, and that's due to some of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| that we've made through the virtual care programs and nurse navigation and etc. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| while we're running more calls or more responses, we're actually not transporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| at the same ratio, right? So as those numbers continue to decline the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| way, that really presents a very healthy EMS system. The thing I am probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| most proud of that we accomplished in this contract is a subcontract on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| forensics transports. That was a very challenging part of our EMS system in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| the old agreement. We were able to work out a contract with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| transport company here that now takes care of all the forensics transports for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| I actually ran into Chris Thomas last week and kind of asked him how things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| were going, and I think his exact words to me were, you're almost getting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| too fast now. So definitely an improvement. And where we see the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| from that, those are ambulances that are now responding to other calls that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| more acutely urgent, as well as our law enforcement partners, and those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| not having to sit on the scene and wait on some of those ambulances that show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| for the forensics transport. So that's been a huge help to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1339)|

| 0:22:43| other things we've got in place now and are kind of robust, we see our hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1363)|

| 0:22:54| The fight isn't over by any means, but we are seeing progress. When you look at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| 60-minute average offload time down to 56, it doesn't seem like a whole lot, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| four minutes times 5,000 transports in a month is 20,000 minutes, right? That adds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| up quickly into the system. So we really hope that trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| continues. We're working hard to make sure we're doing that through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| collaboration with some of our partners in the health systems. So nurse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1396)|

| 0:24:10| our current satisfaction score so far this year is 4.8 out of 5. This is just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1450)|

| 0:24:23| running. This is based on clinical impression once the caregivers arrive on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| scene. If you kind of look to the top left there you see about 4% or 8%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1467)|

| 0:25:05| larger hospitals that does drive our data some with the hospital offload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| delays because you're seeing much more transports going to these so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| these other hospitals and some of those times aren't moving so much and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| some of the bigger facilities but some of the other facilities we are seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| some increase in our offload delays which is helping the trend to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| downward. And this is kind of where the rubber meets the road right we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| talking about performance here. So as you recall there were three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| there's three different zones in this new contract each of which have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| priority one two and three response requirement. I think the focus here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| when we started in February this had never been measured this way. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| county had never looked at the contract and the response times in three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| different zones and three different priorities. So we did we had a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| good finger on the pulse of what the data was going to look like but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| didn't really know because we'd never measured it quite this way. So what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| saw in February this is just the east zone and we'll go through all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| zones quickly. What we saw in February was we didn't nearly have our people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| deployed in the right spot. Now mind you we didn't have the the aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| uptick in our in our staffing started late February early March. But so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| took February and March to really kind of get the pieces of the puzzle in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| right spot so we could meet the response times or at least start a trend upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| And I think what you'll see here is in all three of the slides and all three of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| the zones of the next three slides you will see a marked trend upward. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| quite to 90% yet but it is definitely far better than it was. So progress is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| certainly happening here now. Same story in the west zone. We started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| around 68% or so which is not great. We certainly understand that but again we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| didn't really know what we didn't know. But now we're touching around 90% in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| April for the west zone. And one caveat too quickly just by based on the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| of the presentation for this month we haven't had our meeting yet with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1610)|

| 0:26:59| won't change much based on that number. So just the timing our meeting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| doesn't happen to be until tomorrow. So we'll short all those up but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| shouldn't fluctuate too much in April. And then the next one is an incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| Knoxville zone. So again low 60s up to mid 80s or sorry low 80s so a nice trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| upward. Again not where we want to be but I figure we keep making you know 10 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| 20 point improvements over over a month that's pretty pretty substantial move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| and we will get there. It's just taking a little bit of time. And overall if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| kind of pull all the numbers together and look at one big picture again the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| trend still goes upward to you know around 80 to 85 percent on average for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| overall performance. So I wanted to highlight some of the things that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1659)|

| 0:30:40| questions was asked what makes you think you can do it? And that's a tough one to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| answer right but the answer is I don't think anyone can do it. All of us can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| it not just anyone. And so we really we really focused very very hard and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| continue to focus very hard on collaboration and involvement because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| again this is a system-wide approach we all have to solve together. In that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| picture you see leaders from GMR, you see KFD, KPD, a couple of health systems, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| health department, everyone's at the table. And we sat in that room for seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| hours and understood your their challenges, you understand our challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| and how do we solve it. And we left there with some great takeaways we have we now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| have our next meeting coming up in July I believe. So we've formed subcommittees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| and this this group is really doing a great job of getting together to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| sure that we're we're all focused on the same mission and that is to provide the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| best care we can to the all community of Knox County. I think it's hard to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| where you're going if you don't know what your mission is and so we did come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| up with a mission statement that's on your screen there for AMR and this what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| is Knox 2.0 look like and it is to serve the Knox community by fostering a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| culture of reliability through patient care meaningful engagement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| innovative solutions. I think we're continuing to work hard on making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| we meet our mission. So what's next and this is the last slide I promise I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| tried to talk quickly. As Director Anders mentioned the 9-1-1 dispatch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| transition that is a work in progress. We will be continuing to focus on how we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| that with the least amount of impact to our employees, his employees, but most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| importantly those users of the 9-1-1 system. It is a it is a very strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| and tactical approach to make sure all those things come together at the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| timeline. We do have some new nurse navigation enhancements that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| deploying this month where our fire department personnel are actually will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| have access now to do what we call field referrals to nurse navigators. So if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| arrive on scene they can direct access to care to these patients now when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| they're at the presence of the patient not just through the phone. So opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| up another Avenue to get proper access to care for some that may not need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| to emergency department but still need the need the care. First pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| installation I think the county signed their part of the contract I think last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| month and first pass is the clinical base component of the contract which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| will measure our clinical performance. That's not I think that'll be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| probably in the next week or two. We've met with Dr. Dabbs our County Medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Director last week and we're getting the progress to get all the kind of buttons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| turned on so we all know what we're looking at but that should be turned on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| very soon. And then as part of the contract we were required to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| customer hotline and so that number I want to put on the screen and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| trying our best to get that broadly shared so everyone knows what it is but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| it's pretty easy to remember 855 AMR Knox and anyone who has questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| concerns comments compliments complaints we want them to kind of call that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| and we have 30 minutes for a supervisor to respond and get more information so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| we can begin the investigation. We have had a few unfortunately complaints but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| we've also had a few you know positive remarks too. So again I think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| theme is continued progress and we'll report here every three months on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| They might not be quite as long moving forward and I'll probably spare the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| three-minute videos but I did want to share the kind of where we are today and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| I'm happy to answer any questions anyone may have. Thank you, thank you Josh. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| think we've all been anxious to hear this first report and to to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| better how things are moving forward. So are there any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| Commissioner Jay. Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you for the presentation. Would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| would somebody send that to us as a commission? Yes sir, it'll be sent out this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| evening. Could you go back to the performance slide? Sure. I guess the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| regional. That one? There's three zones and then the overall. Yeah the three that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2068)|
| 0:34:39| one's any of these are fine. I just wanted to make sure I understood overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| performance. Explain that. So that is each category rolled up into like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| overall average of response time right? So for example in a priority three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| response you knew 45 to 43 to 78. So what and this is not how the how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| contract is even measures measured per zone the right side of the screen but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| just tried to put it all on one side to show kind of an easier. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| outlining how often you arrive on time per the contract per the zone. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| Per the call. Correct. Yep so if it's for example if you look at the gray column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| April on the far right. So 78% of the time we arrived to the priority three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| calls within the allotted time frame. Okay. Okay thank you very much and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2125)|
| 0:35:36| that's it that's my question. Thank you. Yes sir. Commissioner Frazier. Thank you Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| Chair and thank you for that report. Been really looking forward to it but a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| of that I'm I already knew because since we we voted I did what I said I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| was going to do and I have maintained constant and regular communication with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| AMR and sometimes weekly sometimes a couple of times a week visiting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| station. I have been to several of the emergency departments. I've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| ride-alongs, talked through different scenarios, helped problem-solve. You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| one thing that we talked about very early on was how to monitor the progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| and success and really talk about the reports that Commission would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| see and so now getting those daily daily reports they can look at what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| yesterday and make it better for tomorrow and the next day. They've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| on where to stage the buses given that information and they have welcomed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| You know I told them from the beginning that you know I was gonna be cautiously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| optimistic and very hopeful and I'm not one to just say hey you know I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| think you can cut it but I wanted to be a part of the solution and kind of walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| alongside them and I've really been trying to do that and I'm glad to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| here and say today that I see progress and we are moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| Yes have we had those calls where you know nurse navigation or telehealth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| there were some concerns. I've been able to reach out immediately and get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| response and they have reached out to the patients to the patient families and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| I just want to say I I see you I see the effort that you are making I see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| seriously you you took some of our no votes you know Josh and I have had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2259)|

| 0:37:50| then they're working so hard to correct that so we want you to be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2270)|
| 0:37:59| because when you're successful and that means that our constituents and and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2279)|

| 0:38:30| right direction. Two of the things that you and I discussed frequently Darren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| when you were here was about the forensics transfer I'm so glad to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| that that it's not only better for AMR it's better for Knox County it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| better for the families that are having this we're having to sit there for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| while and wait after somebody had passed so I'm really glad to see that the nurse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| navigation that was something that you and I talked about because we so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| use telehealth now that is so important so I'm really impressed with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| numbers I expect in three more months I'm gonna be impressed even more but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| appreciate you coming up here bringing your team I want to thank Mr. Anders for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| working with us too and 9-1-1 and we're all behind you I know it's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| tough go for a little while but I just appreciate you appreciate you taking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| time to come up here and share it with us. Thank you. Commissioner Durrett. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| you Madam Chair. Can we go back to the slide that shows the wait times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2374)|
| 0:39:43| You passed it. Go back to the other way. Or the free chart? That's okay. One more, one more. There it is. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2383)|
| 0:40:01| So I noticed in that we talked about the pie chart that a majority of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| transports are either to UT or a covenant facility. Do you see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| because it's a higher volume of transport to those particular locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| that contributing to the wait time being longer and it's I guess it's a two-part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| question with this seeing a downward trajectory in the wait time do you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2424)|

| 0:40:54| do see more staff in the hospitals than I think we've seen in the last several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=2454)|

| 1:05:29| our rules committee. So basically what I am saying is that we would eliminate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| work session and then move our zoning meeting from 7 p.m. on the 4th Monday to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| 5 p.m. on the 3rd Monday for several reasons. One to allow the public to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=3940)|

| 1:05:52| regular meeting if we do run long which here lately seems to be the norm and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| allows our county staff who don't need to be here necessarily for our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=3958)|

| 1:06:28| time when our meetings do go long. So what I'm proposing and the draft of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=3988)|

| 1:07:17| however seeing that we will potentially have we will definitely have five new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| members of Commission and potentially seven though I hope it's five. It might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| behoove us to begin this schedule earlier than September 1 to ensure there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| are no kinks and we have worked out everything once September 1 comes around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| and we do have our new commissioners on board. So I would move to amend that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4061)|
| 1:07:49| be right that September 1 be replaced with June 1 and I do see Director Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4069)|

| 1:08:08| 1 would be sufficient for our for the for zoning coming up. Yes, Amy Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4088)|
| 1:08:16| Knox-Knox County Planning. Yes, we have already advertised for any items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| are going forward what we would need to do is just to do an amendment to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4101)|

| 1:08:29| So it shouldn't be an issue. That would not be an issue. Would it be an issue if this was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| voted on until next Monday or would we need to go ahead and approve that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| evening? I don't think it would be no I think you could do either either or I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| think we could take care of it it wouldn't be an issue since we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| already advertised. Okay. And so I mean the aside from being cognizant of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| it also removes the redundancy that we do when we do when when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| our work session and our legislative agendas we read drives and roads twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4140)|

| 1:09:21| rather than two because we read them at work session and then at our legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| meeting for two months and so it's to it eliminates that redundancy it holds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4165)|

| 1:10:50| consent agenda that Commissioners would have the opportunity to pull from I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4250)|

| 1:11:02| voting meeting. I can speak to that so basically everything else would remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| the same. The preliminary agenda would come out that the Wednesday after agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=4266)|

| 1:46:12| because as the ordinance is currently constituted you could not have this rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| change consistent with the ordinance that was my question is so yes it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240513?start=6376)|
