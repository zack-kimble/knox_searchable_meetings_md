| 0:01:10| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| We have ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| And Commissioner Gill was at a funeral this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| She did advise me prior to the meeting that she will be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| but she will be late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| So you can update the record when she arrives as to the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| of her arrival for vote purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| I know we have quite a few guests here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| and we may even have some folks who may be watching the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Commission meeting for the first time from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| I want to kind of set everybody's expectation and also give you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| little bit of insight to how we run the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| The Knox County Board of Commissioners meets two times every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| Normally we meet on the third Monday as well as the fourth Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| of each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| The meeting last week was considered our work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| where we took our first approach through this agenda that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| working on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| We voted on some of the items then and sent them forward to approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| You'll also notice as we go through tonight's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| when we work our way through the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| at one point the county clerk is going to read a long list of items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| and we're going to vote on all of those at one time as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| both the schools and our general consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| Those are the items that are considered non-controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| things that we passed at last week's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| And rather than voting on each one of them individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| we lump all of them together into what's called a consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| and we'll vote on each one of them once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| You'll also see on the video board above me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| you can tune in if you go to the Knox County website on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| smartphone, you'll have a chance to see a copy of tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| Shortly after I conclude my announcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| we're going to move on to tonight's devotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| pledge allegiance to the flag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| and then I have a couple of folks who wish to speak at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| and we will then go on to some honorary recognitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| Is Kevin Murphy here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| I think I saw him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Mr. Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| I noticed you had signed up to speak at public forum as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| item number 37 in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| You know what I'm going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Is it acceptable to wait until we get to that agenda item for you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Now, moving on for tonight's devotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| Commissioner Larson Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| It is my pleasure to welcome a guest to our commission meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| and I would like to recognize Rabbi Aaron Box from Temple Beth-El,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| who will lead us in a devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| Beloved God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| tonight, like many nights, is a night to count our blessings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| Tonight, as every night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| we think of those in our community who work tirelessly to make our world a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| We thank them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| we are also mindful of those in our community who are still in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| recognizing we still have much to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| In a world in which there exists so much hatred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| so much pain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| we often forget to think about all of the greatness also present here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| our world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| In Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| we have a group of men and women who have one goal in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| the inclusion of all of the many facets of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| It is these positive relationships among our different groups that remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| us how, when we work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| we can achieve great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| One of the most energizing facets of our community is the many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| opportunities present for people to join together, to pray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| to learn together, and in so many other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| It is in those moments that the differences between our groups are blurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| Those moments of communal togetherness can help to bring clarity and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| comfort to even the most confused or hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| As we pray together this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| let us take some time to really listen to the sounds of those around us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| satisfying our own needs while fulfilling our obligations to God and to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| As we pray together this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| I ask God to continue to bless us with good health, friendship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| love, and blessings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| I end this evening with this prayer with a verse from Proverbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| Proverbs 21, 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| He that follows after righteousness and mercy finds life, righteousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| and honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| I'd like to recognize Commissioner Michelle Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| who will lead us in a recitation of our pledge allegiance to our nation's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Can someone stand and salute our flag, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=351)|

| 0:06:43| but it was, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| but it was Cub Scout Group 757 here in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| Did I see Cub Scout 757, Mr. J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| They were, but they had to go do homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| They had to go homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| I saw them making a brief appearance earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| I was going to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Now, we have two other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Yeah, I did recognize Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| We have a couple of folks here under public forum that we're going to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| First, Brian Hare from the mayor's office has an update on the hiring of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| public policy advocate in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| My name is Brian Hare, 400 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| Wanted to bring the commission up to date on our government relations contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| for 2019-2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| You will remember last year we used Ron Ramsey's firm out of northeast Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Nothing against that particular group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| However, we've decided after interviewing a few different firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| we have just went under contract with Stones River Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| Stones River Group is out of Nashville, Tennessee, very strong reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| The cost of that contract, it will actually go into place November 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| and run through October 31st of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| In this contract, though, we do have a 30-day out clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| If at any point we are unhappy with the services that we are receiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| we can notify them in writing and terminate the contract within 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| and we would only be billed what we were responsible for up until that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| I do want to share with you, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| the scope of work that Stones River will be providing, and this is from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| Stones River Group will work with Knox County's leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| to elevate its objectives with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| by providing strategic council, government relations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| and economic development consultation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| We will seek to advance Knox County's policy and budgetary objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| by serving as its boots-on-the-ground advocate in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| Specifically, SRG will provide the services outlined below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Advocate on behalf of Knox County with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=527)|

| 0:08:53| Tennessee General Assembly, and other key state agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Develop and execute strategies to achieve Knox County's goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| including the facilitation of meetings and cultivation of relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| with the right elected and appointed officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Provide ongoing counsel to the Knox County leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| collecting business and political information that could affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Knox County's current and prospective policy objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| Identify, track, lobby for or against legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| that may affect Knox County's objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| during legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| We will provide a weekly legislative wrap-up that includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| a summary of important policy and political developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| that have taken place over the course of said week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| and should the need arise, we will assist Knox County's communication team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| with localized public relations plans and related content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| along with media relations support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| The cost of this contract over the 12 months is $60,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| and they have built in an annual expense budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| That will be capped at $2,500, and that includes the registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| for the policy, lobbying fees, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| and any travel to and from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| They do not expect that to exceed $1,200 over the course of the next 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| but they put $2,500 in there just to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| A little background on this firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| This was actually founded by Mark Cate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| who is the former chief of staff to Governor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| so he's put together a really strong team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| and I do think that they will serve as a strong advocate for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Myself and Chris Caldwell will be their point people here in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| so if there's anything that commission wishes to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| in this current and upcoming legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| please get with Chris and I, and we'll get SRG on the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| and they will be coming in periodically to brief commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Also, on the months when they do not come in, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| they will be sending weekly updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| I will report those monthly to commission at the last meeting of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| No, I understand that's a pretty good deal you got for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| based on their scope of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Heck of a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Heck of a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=659)|

| 0:11:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| And then also, does not one of their members of SRG have some local connections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=669)|

| 0:11:20| No conflict, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| No conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=683)|

| 0:24:07| Did you forget that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| This is one of the fun ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| Actually, I'm going to come down and read this from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| And then we'll have everybody step up in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| So I guess this is something I can't tell you all how excited I am about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| I remember when I first got elected that I called Kim Bumpus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| And, by the way, let's use this as an opportunity to thank our friends at Visit Knoxville for bringing the classic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1470)|
| 0:24:41| It generated over 153 individual visits to different BASMAT, 53,000 clicks into different events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| one of the best-attended classics in the history of the classic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1488)|

| 0:25:33| Whereas Knoxville native, Ott Faux, won the 2019 Bassmaster Classic earlier this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| and whereas, you can help hold that here too, there we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| whereas the Bassmaster Classic, taking place this year on the Tennessee River in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| is the biggest competition in bass fishing and is often called the Super Bowl of Bass Fishing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| and whereas this year marked Ott Faux's eighth time competing at the Bassmaster Classic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| and his first time winning the three-day competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| and whereas the first day of the competition, Ott dominated with his five best fish weighing 20 pounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1564)|
| 0:26:13| including the biggest catch of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| and whereas after falling behind on the second day of competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| Ott persevered and had a strong finish on the final day of competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| catching 18 pounds, 14 ounces of bass, to crown him the winner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| and whereas Ott came into the 2019 Bassmaster Classic already an accomplished fisherman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| with 103 tournament appearances since 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| including two first-place finishes in Bassmaster Elite competitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| and three in Bassmaster Open events on Douglas Lake, historic Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| So, that's where my wife is from, that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| And whereas the Knox County Commission wishes to recognize Ott Faux| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| for winning the 2019 Bassmaster Classic and showing the skill and determination of a true champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1619)|

| 0:28:14| and the city was a good one, but the county definitely holds a special place in my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| But no, just as you said to start with, a huge thanks to Kim, Chad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| and the whole team with Visit Knoxville and the Sports Commission and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| to have this event here, their foresight and their determination to be able to pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| They set it all up for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1714)|

| 0:28:40| So, just very thankful for everything you all did to get that event here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| and to take that chance and very glad that the bass fishing community showed up like they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| I'll tell you what we could do is you all could put up the trophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| and I'd like to invite all my fellow commissioners and your family to join us for a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| Okay, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1736)|

| 0:30:26| The chair recognizes our sheriff, Tom Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I just wanted to say and also add my accolades to Ott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| Also, his parents were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| I know that they didn't recognize him, but, Bud, thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| The one thing I want to say about Ott is he's a class act, and he's a fine young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| and I know you all are proud of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| This is a fishing family of those that you all don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| but I had the opportunity to travel with Ott one year when I fished on a tour with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| As I said, there's not a better class act than Ott DeFoe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| and I want to say congratulations, hopefully, to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| I didn't mention it was just how much that I do have to thank my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| my wife in support of her putting up with me being gone so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| and her and the kids get to come a good bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| but having great parents like I do that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| is just something as crazy as being a professional bass fisherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So, no, I just really can't thank them enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1894)|

| 0:32:31| The clerk's office did send out, if you recall in your e-mail, two sets of minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| because it was the minutes for the meeting as well as the special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| So is there anything good with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=1962)|

| 0:42:55| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| Mr. Chairman, I'm on number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| Number 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Yeah, I abstained in the work session, and it's on the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| I didn't know that an abstention would put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| She read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| It's 13 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Well, what you can do if you want to be clear, we've got a quorum even if you don't vote on the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| agenda, so you can just not vote on this and you'll be good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Okay, the Chair will entertain a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| All right, we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Jay with a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2620)|

| 0:43:42| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| And may the record reflect that Commissioner Anders abstained from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2624)|
| 0:43:52| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| We are back on page 3, Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| It's appointing two individuals to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| Okay, I'm going to look to both Jill and the Law Director, just confirming that we do have two appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| because the Sheriff's Department has appointed one person as well to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| This is confirming that we are appointing two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| What I'd like to do, more so for some of the applicants for these roles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| have expressed an interest in maybe watching the proceedings on closed-circuit television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| I know all the Commissioners know how the vote procedure is going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| but I'm going to take just a couple of minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| and I know this is probably going to fall under the case of boring government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| but we do have specific rules and process for these types of committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| And I will read from the Knox County Commission Rulebook, page 5, section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| The procedure for appointing committee members, board members, the county internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| or other appointed officers shall be as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| Each member of the Commission shall have an opportunity by roll call to nominate a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| or persons to serve in each vacant position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| Nominations do not require a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| The application of a nominee for a vacant position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| shall represent the nominee's willingness to serve in the position if appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| The Commission Chair shall also allow registered voters of the county an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| to submit names to the Commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Names may be submitted in writing to the Chair prior to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| or may be submitted in person at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| In order for a name to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| a member of the Commission must subsequently nominate that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Nominators may speak about their nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Nominees may speak about themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| For the record, as you all know, we had a special session last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| where the nominees had a chance to speak about themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| After nominations are ended, nominations shall be closed by motion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| The Chair will then call for discussion by Commissioners regarding all the nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| After each Commissioner is afforded ample opportunity to express his or her views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| and responding views, the Chair will ask if all Commissioners are ready for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| If any Commissioner wants further discussion, further discussion will be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| When discussion is complete, voting will commence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| By roll call vote, each Commissioner may vote in favor of one nominee by name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| and the nominee with the least number of votes is disqualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| After each vote, the Chair will invite further discussion by Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| regarding the remaining nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| If there is a tie vote, the Chair will invite the nominators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| and remaining nominees to speak again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| and the Chair will invite further discussion by Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Voting will resume until a nominee receives a majority of the votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| of the membership of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| With that said, Madam Clerk, we'll need to proceed with a roll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| to accept nominees for the floor for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| You can start wherever we were based on our last roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| We'll start with Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2807)|

| 0:48:27| I think that completes the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Will you pass the nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| That is, all folks who have made the list, their names are now on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| Move to cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| All right, we have a motion to cease nominations from Commissioner Jay with a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| All in favor of ceasing nominations, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Okay, at this point, would any of the commissioners like to speak in favor of any of their nominees that they have put forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2929)|
| 0:49:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Madam Clerk, we can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| And I also want to say, you all heard me read through these detailed rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| Basically, what's going to happen is everyone who's nominated for these slots, we're going to have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| We're going to go around the board, and each commissioner is going to make a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| The nominee who has the least votes are going to fall off, and if one person has a majority, then they'll be selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| So you're probably going to see us go through several rounds of voting until we come together on what will be the first slot to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| We'll then do it again for the second slot, and then we'll make a motion to vote on a resolution that has those two names in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| So, Madam Clerk, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| A lot of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2982)|

| 0:49:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| Yes, all the nominees spoke to us last week, except for, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| was Michael Singetary, a no-show at the work session last week, at the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| Does anybody remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| So, Michael Singetary was not at the meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3018)|

| 1:00:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Does anyone want to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3624)|
| 1:00:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| We have one that is going to drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3636)|

| 1:00:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| The record, thank you, is McBee, 5, Adagnost, 3, and Beal, 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| If you remember when we were doing the asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| I asked about, you know, how they would litigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| or how they would respond to the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| There was only two people that answered like it should be answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| and I'm not going to tell you who because I kept the record there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| You all have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| The ethics committee is a quasi-judicial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| and they are supposed to listen to the evidence that's given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| and then make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Some of these people that we have left here said that they would investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| and that's not one of the things that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| which means that they haven't looked at the ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| and what they're supposed to be doing as being on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| So, again, that's why I was asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| So whoever you get there that said that they were going to investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| meant that they never looked at this to make sure of what they were getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| We are allowed to speak for a nominee, not against nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| I didn't mention a name, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| I just said that's what we ask the questions for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| and for some reason we didn't listen to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=3742)|

| 1:13:41| favor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| Madam clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4425)|
| 1:13:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| It's item number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Approving the conversion of the interest rate on the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| government public improvement bond series VI-K-1 from an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| index rate to a daily or weekly rate and approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| documents in connection therewith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4443)|
| 1:14:03| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| Schoonmaker and a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| If you're watching at home, we have two different issues of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| bonds that we're going to be doing this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| So hence the reason for two separate resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| But this is virtually identical to the first one that we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| Is there any discussion on the second resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Madam clerk, would you begin a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| Starting with Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4470)|
| 1:14:30| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4471)|
| 1:14:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Would you just inform the public why we're issuing these bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| I must have missed it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Well, what I'll do is I'll actually, this is sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| basically a refile like on your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| But Mr. Ayers, I'll tell you what, Mr. Caldwell, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| remember what the issuance was to pay for, Mr. Ayers, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| could, in layman's term, kind of talk about what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| What we're doing, you're correct, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| This is like a refinancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| So we're refinancing some existing bonds from one type of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| rate mode to another type of interest rate mode, to lower the cost of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| County to save interest dollars over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| What the projects were for, I have no idea because that was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| I'm like Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4516)|
| 1:15:16| I don't recall what they were for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| They were bonds from a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| So those projects have already been started and completed and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| just still making payments on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| So it's just a way for us to reduce the cost of interest by going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| through a different instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4537)|
| 1:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4538)|
| 1:15:38| Any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| And then this one's U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Madam clerk, would you please begin the roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4545)|

| 1:16:24| Madam clerk, if you don't mind, and my fellow commissioners as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| favor to a visitor I see tonight, I'd like us to go ahead and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| care of item number 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| This was the item that we had to pull off of the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| because as it relates to a TIF, we do need to have a roll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| vote on that one, although it went through last week seamlessly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| but I see a very interested party in our audience, so I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| make sure that we went, as he just walked in, went ahead and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4608)|

| 1:18:56| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4736)|
| 1:18:56| Is there anyone from the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| Sherry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4739)|
| 1:18:59| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4741)|
| 1:19:01| I saw Sherry Witt earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| But I'm not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| And this may be a Chris Caldwell question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| I'm not sure, but I'll, I'll ask of you and whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Lesseur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4756)|
| 1:19:16| I'm just kind of curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| Why, why are the, would the build-out costs come out of the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| when the clerk's office, I think it was reported last week, returns close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| to $2 million in excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| So it would seem that the court, the clerk's office would have more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| adequate funding within its own budget to do any kind of build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4781)|
| 1:19:41| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| The clerk turns over the excess fees, which come into our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| The only thing the clerk can spend fees for are salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4786)|
| 1:19:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4793)|
| 1:19:53| So that's part of the statute of how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4796)|
| 1:19:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4796)|
| 1:19:56| Just wanted to give you clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4799)|
| 1:19:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4804)|

| 1:20:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4811)|
| 1:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Madam clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Item number 37, resolution 906 is to amend and reinstate the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4813)|
| 1:20:20| Farragut, Knox County growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4824)|
| 1:20:24| Could I have a motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Before, I know there will be a discussion on this item and I believe Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Murphy, he's right over there, just out of my line of sight and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Murphy, if you'd like to go ahead and approach the podium for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| you've got five minutes to speak on this item and there may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| some other follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| Thank you very much, Chairman Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| I'm here representing the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| We've distributed some materials to all of you and we'd like you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| consider postponing this item tonight while you consider some alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| that might allow this to be better enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| So I think, I know every one of you has been involved in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| that the county has been going through for the last 10 months now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| to update the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| We've all said that, you know, our general goals are we want to get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| with and we want to update, modernize, and streamline our planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| and our plan framework and have a strategy and a vision that get us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| where we want to go to with getting some more local control to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| that doesn't have to be taken care of with Knoxville and Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| So that's all well and good, but we've all said, well, the tricky part is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| the dance of how this is enacted and then how that impacts the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| how that flows down, how they interact, and then how all those changes get made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4916)|
| 1:22:04| We've documented what we think are some potentially problematic results of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| adopting the growth plan amendment that's been proposed as is, without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| making any corresponding updates to the general plan, those result residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| density is kind of a little bit unclear in some of the areas, the zones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| are allowed are more unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| There's some, so there's some conflicts that happen between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| general and the sector plans as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| The, there's a little bit of unclarity around the slope percentages, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| then just understanding what stuff is advisory, like in the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| classification tables versus mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| So there's, there's a lot of stuff that will, by passing this right now will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| become murky and cause some really challenging issues for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| involved in planning, zoning, and implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| There's a couple of approaches that might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| We've, we've proposed an approach of tabling the, this growth plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| for several months, initiating a transition amendment, which the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| commission body has the ability to do, but a amendment to the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| that would incorporate some of the key provisions from the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| So that would at least, you know, stabilize and give us a certain planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| framework, and then once you do that, and we have a small transit, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| call it a transition amendment, to the general plan, then untable and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| pass the growth plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| We think that gives everybody a little bit more certainty and it allows the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| the update of the general plan, which I know we're talking about doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| over the next few years, to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| There's also a, an option that is out there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| We could actually, pass the growth plan amendment as is, but with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| language that like, said that you wanted to do that, but not enact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| provisions of it until the general plan update process is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| which is a longer process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Either of these, they're kind of two-step processes, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| our, our organization, KCPA, would be in favor of either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| What we're really, up here though is, we've, we've, we've done a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| of work to understand it, the long document, really detailed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| You know, I'd like to say we know what we're talking about and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| some uncertainty, that, that this, proposed plan amendment, generates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| So we'd really ask you to consider it carefully and see if there's a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| to, to enact this in a way that allows us to still have, you know, a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| bit more certainty going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5079)|
| 1:24:39| The chair, there may be some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| The chair recognizes Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5085)|
| 1:24:45| Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| Under the, resolution, the second page, where it says the, to read, to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5087)|
| 1:24:55| the plan as follows, there's the second section, which says addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| rezonings in the rural area, that they will be controlled by the applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| sector plan as adopted by the MPC in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| So, do you have a problem with that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| That?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| Yeah, the, the, the, the major challenge there is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| general plan and the sector plans, they have some of, some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| sector plans have something called the land use classification table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| which says if your sector plan designation is X, then these are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| zones that should be considered for underneath that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| But it doesn't say, but as we read through it, it's, it's not clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| if that's mandatory or if that's kind of advisory and that's guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| So it could be that your sector plan designation says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| this is for a rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| I believe that is a sector plan designation, but, and it suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| some underlying zonings that should happen, but it doesn't say that it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| We'd really propose that there's a, this land use classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| really should be made as an amendment to the general plan, and it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| have some language that says, this is what it, you know, if you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| it says must versus should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| So we think that that's a, that's a big, it's a big thing that should just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| be done to the general plan anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| So that table, that land use classification table, by the way, does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| not exist in all of the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| So some of them don't even have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| And then the next thing on the agenda is for appropriations to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| redo the county general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| So are you in favor of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Yes, our, our, our organization very much is in favor of beginning to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| on a log update of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| We think that's a, I mean, that's a 2033 general plan and it's 17 years old with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5208)|
| 1:26:55| that, yeah, we think that there's a lot of opportunity to streamline that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| make that a lot better framework for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5221)|
| 1:27:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5223)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Schoonmaker, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| Yeah, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5226)|
| 1:27:06| Murph, I appreciate you coming up and, and being a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| But the, the reality is that the city and the county and the town of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5229)|
| 1:27:16| Farragut, soil conservation, and a few other people that are already on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| committee, I mean, this has went through a rigorous process and, and this, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| some ways our growth plan is, is holding some of our land, our homeowners, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5246)|
| 1:27:34| keep stalling it, it's going to make it worse because you're going to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| density all over the place instead of clustering in some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| And so it's really holding a, you know, tabling this only holds us up from doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| what we think is the right thing to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| I mean, this, this passed unanimously coming out of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| And I think that it's worthy of noting that, that everybody at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| table agreed that it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| And so I, I think we should move forward with it and continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| working on the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| But if the general plan can fix what the growth plan, you all know as I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| that the growth plan wins out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| And so the delay only triggers more develop, sparse or larger development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| tracks instead of putting things in clusters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| So I think it defeats the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| I think the delay tactic is, is trying to be used because you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| And so I think that allowing the planning commission to move forward while everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| at the table already agrees is, is probably the best move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| So I think, I hope our commission does that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5318)|
| 1:28:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5318)|
| 1:28:38| Commissioner Anders, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5323)|
| 1:28:43| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| Murphy, did, did you participate in those committee, the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| coordinating committee sessions and air these same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| Yes, we, yeah, we provided probably over a hundred pages of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| documentation to the growth policy committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| And we did speak at both of the public forum meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| where we were permitted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| So following up on commissioner Anders, if, if all of these elements were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| presented to the gross policy committee, which can prize of Knox County, city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| Knoxville, town of Farragut, KUB, board of education, soil conservation district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| chamber of commerce and Hallsdale Powell utility district, why if they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| adopt any of them and there were that many people at the table, why, why bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| them up again when that walked out the door unanimously, is this sort of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5373)|
| 1:29:41| appeal at the last minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| I don't think this is an appeal at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| I, the committee members have a, they were trying, they're trying to set a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5385)|
| 1:29:54| direction of, they would like to free the county up from, they would like to free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5394)|
| 1:30:05| the county up from having to go to the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| when they want to make some changes like on what zones are allowed in, say, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| know, in, in the county areas based off of sector plan designation or what, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| zones are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| The growth plan has some very specific things associated with the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| That was their major concern, but there was no talk or discussion by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| committee members about how this would be enacted and how it would ripple down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| through the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| So that is, the discussion of what this actually, there was a policy discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| at a high level, but the discussion of how to enact it properly was not, not ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| We did raise that, but I never heard that in any of the brief discussion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| occurred at the, of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| And are the concerns that you've raised in your documentation, are those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| that would not be addressed through the normal planning process or, as, as, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5460)|
| 1:31:07| you say, get out of the thousand foot level and into the weeds, as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| properties come up or, or things come up before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| So I think the, the, the challenge that we have is the, the growth plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5474)|
| 1:31:22| intertwined into the general plan and the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| Changes at the top level of the growth plan, the general plan and the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| plans made assumptions that things were being stated up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| When those things are no longer stated, those items are no longer stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| The, the general plan and sector plan don't have corresponding policies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| are clear, that specify how, and, you know, the general plan basically expects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5502)|
| 1:31:50| that stuff to be in the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| So the enactment trick, I think, is that there's, there's some stuff that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| missing from our general plan today that needs to be in there for people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| understand, you know, what, what actually happens when you designate, when you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| a sector plan and you designate it with this sector, what types of zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| should be there underneath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| So the other, the other thing that I'm not clear on is the argument of cluster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| development has been used as the driver of the growth policy plan changes, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| nobody's really ever explained why they think the actions that are being removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| from the growth plan actually inhibit cluster development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| I've never heard an argument what the inhibition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| I sort of, again, things that should be done in that committee, I think not in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| well, I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5567)|
| 1:32:47| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5570)|
| 1:32:50| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| I mean, you've just hit upon the very points we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| The, the how, the implementation, the 20,000 view to the actual approval of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| Those details are, are, and have not been discussed and really don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| answers that we need as we move forward to implementation, especially centered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| around the cluster developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| They're just not very clear and I support the, the opportunity to further the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5593)|
| 1:33:20| discussion so that we can get some of those answered out and I, I want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| this observation because I know that Knox County is the first to vote on it, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| wanted to hear really what, if any issues the city and the town of Farragut had as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5608)|
| 1:33:35| we move to the how in the implementation of that is still really unclear as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5621)|
| 1:33:41| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| Was it Commissioner Smith first or me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| No, actually I think when I wrote it down, I actually wrote you down first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| So if you guys, we can go either way, but I said, actually, I got a question for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| for the law director, if you could just help me wrap my mind around this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| If, if we vote on this tonight on the growth policy, would it give us full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| autonomy to make corrections to the general plan before we enact this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| amendment with that, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| If you pass this tonight, the general plan, the sector plan becomes a subset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| The implementation of the bigger policy would happen at those levels and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| would be autonomous to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| Would it be autonomous to Farragut County to make corrections to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5675)|
| 1:34:35| It would be autonomous to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| Currently it is a bipartisan approval between the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| subject to the old growth policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| I think what the mayor is trying to achieve is to have the same authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| over the development and zoning of Knox County as that the other two partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| had when it was first implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| We had some caveats that remained with the city in terms of county zoning under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5700)|
| 1:35:07| the old growth policy until it expired in 2007, which basically by default,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| throws it to the county, but the mayor wants solid clarity in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| And then I thank this body and the planning commission, then we'll start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| working on the implementational phases and carrying some of the clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| That's my understanding, but this will allow Knox County to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| authority without the other two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5739)|
| 1:35:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5743)|
| 1:35:43| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| I could kind of tell you, Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| I said, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5749)|
| 1:35:49| Raul, director or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Green back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| This new section added where the sector plan as adopted by the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| Commission in Knox County, we will follow that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| That sector plan, if we vote, we vote tonight and I have something in my ninth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| district and it's out of the sector plan that we have currently, it's not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| happen until we update that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| It's not a black, white, yes or no on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| It depends on what the project is, whether you all amend the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| but vote of this body, whether there's any dynamics there that this body wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| to take, you have that ability to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| And that's part of what this plan change does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| It gives the County the ability to look at its own and direct its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| growth and direct its own zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Sector plans are renewed and they go through a regular schedule anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| And this just ties our growth policy of Knox County to our zoning and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| sectors and our plans and our rules without approval of any other jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5812)|
| 1:37:01| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5821)|
| 1:37:01| Green, I think I see you back there hiding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5821)|
| 1:37:11| While you're headed to see the mayor, I'm going to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| While you're headed this way, the process, if we pass tonight at County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| Commission, go to the city of Knoxville, Town of Farragut, what would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| timeframe to start looking at the growth plan, the general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| And I believe that Gerald Green, director of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| planning, your last question, I provided a commission chair, and I shared it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| with Mayor Jacobs, a potential schedule for updating the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| We'd work with the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| I'm going to have Drusilla email out this budget document that you just sent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| Engineering public works, because we do a land use plan and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| plan comprehensively and together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| So we'd work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| We'd have to do a scope of work, an RFQ, review the RFQ, select a consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| negotiate a contract, enter into a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| So it would be spring, late spring to early summer before the work actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| started, there's a number of steps to do prior to actually starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| the update of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Trying to answer your other questions, our law director Armstrong was correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| that it's not clear black and white in that this commission has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| ability to amend a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| In fact, there are two or three sector plan amendments on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| the agenda this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| So you have that control of what these amendments to the growth plan would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| Would it eliminate the density restrictions and some zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| restrictions on the rural area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| The impact on the rural area would be most significant in that the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| limitations and the limitations on the zones permitted in the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| area would no longer apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| We would have, KCP, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| Murphy would have a chance while we review these plans to try to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| these other items adopted or not adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5948)|
| 1:39:08| And not only during the amendment of those plans would they have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| opportunity to have input, but on sector plan amendments, when there is a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| for a sector plan amendment, the public has the opportunity to comment on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| prior to the recommendation or action by the planning commission and prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| any action by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5967)|
| 1:39:27| Yeah, I'd like to weigh in on this, but I usually as chair kind of like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| wait kind of towards the end on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| I guess I would urge us to be very cautious as we go into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| And I'm just going back to our original county planning retreat when we knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| that we wanted to be very intentional as we do things that relate to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| planning for both infrastructure, zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| It was a very big, big part of our commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| You know, where I am personally on this, I get the amendment and I'd be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| favor of the amendment, but I'm one of the folks who would kind of like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=5995)|

| 1:40:12| having the city and the Farragut way in, and then having an updated general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| You know, we'll get onto the discussion, but I'm fairly confident that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| appropriate the dollars and do a really good job on the updating the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| plan and use it as a, as a tight guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| I just, and I think this amendment would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| I just, I worry a little bit about from an updating plans point of view, that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| in between when it passes and, you know, when it gets implemented, you know, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| that's kind of, kind of where I'm coming from on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| So, yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6048)|
| 1:40:48| I just wanted to verify with Vice Mayor Pavlin, is it on your agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| for the August the 14th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| For the town of Farragut to vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| I'm sorry, November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Jeez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Yes, that is my understanding that we're supposed to be discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| at the November 14th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6070)|
| 1:41:10| And then I guess, you know, in my district, I don't have a lot of rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| area left, but Commissioner Beeler, you have a tremendous amount, and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| wondering if you would want to just weigh in and what your opinion is regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| this, since it would dramatically affect your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Well, I mean, either way, it's going to dramatically affect my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| I guess my question is going to be, what is the timeframe it would take to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| update the general plan if this is put on hold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| I mean, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| I mean, I want to see us do it in the right order, but I don't want us to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| stuck to the point that by tabling this, we don't do anything for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6108)|
| 1:41:56| indeterminate amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| That's my only concern is, I agree that protections have got to be in place, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| the general plan needs to be amended and updated accordingly, but something's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| got to be done first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| I mean, that's where I am, is I don't want this thing to sit and nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| happened for a year, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Director Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| This will only affect property that's in the rural growth area, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Largely, those standards would no longer apply in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| And that property is currently, I would say, 99% zoned agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| I say you're correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| And anything that happened to any zoning on agricultural would have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| before MPC and this body, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| And anything that zoning changed would still be governed by our current general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| plan, if it went out of the rural area into agricultural, it would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| governed by our general and sector plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| By the sector plans, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| Is it possible to come up with a general plan if you don't know what the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| plan is or the growth plan, the driver of what, or a driver in this area of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6196)|
| 1:43:25| agricultural, it's the main driver in agricultural, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| And could you plan properly, not knowing what parts will become available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6210)|
| 1:43:37| It would be like taking a road trip and not knowing where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| All right, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Just one quick final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| For 19 years, we've done nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| For 19 years, we've ignored this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| And I would agree with Commissioner Beeler in that we have an opportunity to at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| least push the ball a little bit and get things rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| We have lots of opportunity to change things along the way, lots of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| to amend things, this doesn't hamper us from changing any of their growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| But sitting around waiting for the next step, for the next RFE, for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| process, could be a year or years, and I think we've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| So let's let 19 years pass by and put more grass under our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| Let's get going a little bit and let's know that we have the benchmarks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| the opportunities to change as we go, but move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6273)|
| 1:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| Is there any other additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| You know, I'll say I'm very hesitant just as I was in the field when I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| take a month to make sure we didn't have any unintended consequences on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| But the motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| So the chair will seek a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6296)|

| 1:45:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6300)|

| 1:45:12| I can't, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| Who was a nay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6314)|
| 1:45:14| You and Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| And Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Let's just do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| And Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6325)|
| 1:45:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6325)|
| 1:45:25| To confirm the, the nays were Commissioner Gill, Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| Nystrom, and Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6331)|

| 1:47:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6450)|
| 1:47:30| Commissioner Nystrom votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| And Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6453)|
| 1:47:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6459)|
| 1:47:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| Madam clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| Item number 39, discussion item regarding appropriations for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| Knoxville, Knox County planning for the growth, I'm sorry, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| the county growth general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6472)|
| 1:47:52| This is a pretty good transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| We've got about 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| I also want to be clear, especially for those of you who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| may have joined us for the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| The zoning meeting will start at 10 minutes after seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| I want to give us a chance to talk about this for about 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| minutes and then we'll take a quick break and then come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| and start the zoning meeting at about 10 minutes after seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| if that's acceptable to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| Yeah, I brought, yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| I'm going to comment on this one in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6500)|
| 1:48:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6500)|
| 1:48:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6500)|
| 1:48:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| I wanted to bring this item to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Updating these plans is a very important piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| I know that we've got multiple years to probably get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| but I want to call on Commissioner Smith to go ahead and open the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| Well, first I'd like to just point out that until the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| amendment's in place, you really don't have a direction in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| to do your general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| But I wanted to ask Director Green about the cost of a general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| plan and what were those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| I think I've seen those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| It was somewhere around a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| That's for a general plan and the transportation plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| a comprehensive county transportation plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| Of that funding, the transportation plan would take at least 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| likely 70 percent of that cost with the remaining cost being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| for the general plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| We felt that it would be a better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| We always hear land use and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Anytime there's a land issue, transportation becomes interrelated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| or intertwined with land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| Also, by doing the two together, we would likely reduce the overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| cost as opposed to doing them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| How much did RECODE cost the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| The consultant's fee was approximately $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| Can we just hire them for $300,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| The general plan is a city-county combined plan, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| The current general plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| Would the new one not be also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| By separating the growth plan and the action being taken now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| for the further action, it would be a separate plan for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| outside of the city, although as a city resident, I'm also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| county resident and I pay county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| So, the two are intricately related and if county taxpayers are funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| we have to address a portion where a third of the county residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| live, that's the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| So, we will be looking at some aspects of the city, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| from a transportation standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| And the city is currently, are they still part of the 2033 plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| They are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Will they be updating their plan also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| That, I have not broached with the administration change at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| city that will happen next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| Would it be advisable with the new RECODE to change their plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| It should in some way affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| The zoning ordinance, luckily with the city being in the urban area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| there aren't the restrictions on zoning as there are in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| So, the zoning ordinance is not impacted as significantly by the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6666)|
| 1:51:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6673)|
| 1:51:13| And how long do you think it would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| 18 months or so to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| That's based on conversations for three consulting firms that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| have expertise in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| And would the sector plans be updated at the same time also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| The sector plans would then form the regular updates to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| They would mesh, we would have to work with them to mesh with the new general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| plan and then update the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6702)|
| 1:51:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6704)|
| 1:51:44| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6707)|
| 1:51:47| I've just got one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Is this the horse or is this the cart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| I'd say this would be the cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| Oh, do we have the horse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| Well, I think you could say passing the amendment that we just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| Previous, that would probably be a horse and this would be the cart behind the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| Thank you for the well said metaphor, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| So, and with the horse discussion, I guess you'd call this the main discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6739)|
| 1:52:19| Next, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6744)|
| 1:52:24| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| He answered the question regarding the sector plan updates and the costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| associated with the entire process and the transportation components as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| represent a district with lots of issues regarding transportation in that core city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| But I think we're out of order, especially with those sector plans that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| impact the decisions regarding this transportation plan that will then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| essentially drive the conversation for our growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| I just think what we've done was it's putting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| Well, from a little bit more grassroots, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| Green, if you could please approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Getting back down to kind of talking a little hard dollars, budget, that type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| of thing, just kind of talk a little bit about, I know that there's a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| of stakeholders in updating the general plan, you know, different sources of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| revenue, different budget cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| Could you kind of go over that just a little bit for the purpose of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| commission as well as the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| I'll have to refer to my notes, but of the total amount, $500,000 was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6802)|
| 1:53:30| last week through the TPO executive board approving the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6810)|
| 1:53:36| improvement program for the coming three fiscal years, $500,000 was allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| in that for the update of the county mobility or transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| With that comes $125,000 mandatory match from the county for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| transportation plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| So that sets aside $625,000 dedicated to the updated county transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6832)|
| 1:54:00| There's a projection of another $60,000 from TDOT to be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| the North Shore corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| So now you're looking at close to $700,000 for transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| And we have show a $300,000 allocation over two fiscal years from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6851)|
| 1:54:18| county for the general plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| The land use component of that, again, about $700,000 for the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| plan and about $300,000 for the general plan, and these are estimates at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| time until we actually contract with a firm or team of consultants to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6872)|
| 1:54:39| We don't know the actual cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| This is the ultimate that we, or the maximum that we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6880)|
| 1:54:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6887)|
| 1:54:47| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6888)|
| 1:54:48| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6889)|
| 1:54:49| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6890)|
| 1:54:50| Of the three consulting firms that you said you contacted, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| any of them close to East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| One team is actually consultants who work out of their homes via computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| The closest one is in South Carolina, or actually just moved to Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6907)|
| 1:55:15| There are none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| The engineering aspects of those are more local East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| The land use consultants are not in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6925)|
| 1:55:25| It just seems, or it appears in the past that when we've hired some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| these outside consulting firms, they don't really have a clue what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| on here and some of their advice, and it just, it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| That's why I was wondering if there's anybody that was in close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| proximity to East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| And we may find some as we go through the RFQ process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6950)|
| 1:55:50| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6950)|
| 1:55:50| Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6951)|
| 1:55:51| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6952)|
| 1:55:52| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| From what I gather from what you just said, it'll be a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| If we allocate money, you put out the RFQ and you all do the hiring, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| we have no say in who that contractor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| The contract would have to be approved by the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6968)|
| 1:56:08| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| I know this will be something that we'll probably be focusing on a lot for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| next few months or the next year, especially as we go into the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| cycle, but I guess part of the good news is some of that money is not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| directly appropriated from the County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| We've got multiple sources of funding to help pay for this and pay for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| over two different fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| Seeing that, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6992)|
| 1:56:32| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| Can I just make a quick announcement before we break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| Because this will be the end of our meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| This will be, Madam Clerk, we've gone through all the, everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| I think we're right at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7000)|

| 1:57:13| Before we close this meeting, are there any other announcements before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| we take a break and go to zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7035)|

| 2:00:52| North County sector plan designation of MBRO and that the office zoning would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| provide a transition between the existing commercial zoning along East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7258)|

| 2:01:32| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7292)|
| 2:01:32| Chair, I'd like to move for approval per staff recommendation for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7299)|
| 2:01:39| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Bussler and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| Can we make it just point of order when Commissioner Bussler, when you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| staff recommendation, that's not really it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| It's the commission, the MPC commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| So there's no confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| And I think later in a sentence, I thought he got to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| I heard you say it after you said that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| I was trying to get this piece of cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7322)|
| 2:02:02| I'm doing the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7323)|
| 2:02:03| The cake got to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7323)|
| 2:02:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| So we do have, I'll restate the motion to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| The motion on the floor is to approve this per MPC, per Knox County planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7328)|
| 2:02:15| recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7336)|
| 2:02:16| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Bussler did a person second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| Commissioner Biggs, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7342)|
| 2:02:22| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7342)|
| 2:02:22| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| Green, I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| I've had a couple of phone calls about this specific piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7345)|
| 2:02:31| Number one, the question was, is there going to be any additional lanes done on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| Emory Road because that's at a traffic light where Dry Gap Pike and Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| intersect, that's located by a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| It's a highly populated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| And just roadways, is there anything...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| With the rezoning, we don't get into the traffic impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| We anticipate that the existing street system could accommodate most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| traffic that would be generated during the development plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| If the development, proposed development, generates the traffic required, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7378)|
| 2:03:06| that's the threshold for requiring a traffic impact analysis, we would look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| more closely at the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| With a six-acre development, the likelihood that it would generate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| traffic needed to meet the threshold for a traffic impact study is unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| I think because there's multiple commercial things going on around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| You've got Mahalo Coffee coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| You've got, I believe, Steve Maddox building, a building right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| beside the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| You've got an expansion for Adrian Burnett going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| Just the community out there, reach out, and I just wanted to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| we fully understand everything that's going on in this specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7427)|
| 2:03:47| One of our challenges is that when you have an incremental development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| none of them generates traffic to meet the threshold for traffic analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| And that's the reason, as mentioned earlier, we're looking at updating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| the transportation plan for the county so we can identify those issues and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7440)|
| 2:04:06| put them on the traffic impact improvement or traffic improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| program for the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| I'd like to second Commissioner Bussler's motion, if he doesn't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7456)|

| 2:04:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7457)|
| 2:04:17| Oh, there was a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7459)|

| 2:04:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7460)|
| 2:04:20| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=7463)|

| 2:14:16| about the density from the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191028b?start=8056)|
