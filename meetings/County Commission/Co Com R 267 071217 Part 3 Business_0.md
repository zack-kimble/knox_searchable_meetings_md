| 0:00:20| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=20)|

| 0:00:24| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=24)|
| 0:00:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=29)|
| 0:00:30| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| I'm going to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=33)|
| 0:00:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=37)|
| 0:00:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| I guess, Paul, could you just explain to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| since we already approved to have subpoena power over the travel allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=53)|
| 0:01:05| how is this different and what are you asking for here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=65)|
| 0:01:10| Could you pull your microphone down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| I think we need to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| I'm going to ask John to tell us how to go about invoking these subpoena powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| and what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| Travel allowance audit is back, and I think it's time now that we discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| So you're just asking for a discussion on what we've already approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| and how we move forward with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| How to go about doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| So there's really no action to take tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| It's just a matter of discussing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Well, I think he's already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| Well, possible action to vote on whatever he tells us then, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| So I guess until we know what possible plan comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| we don't have anything to vote on yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Well, I believe in September we voted to talk about this when this travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| And we need these subpoena powers more than likely to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| I just, I mean, because we don't have anything in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| I don't think, that talks about what action we're going to move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| until we hear what the law director has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| I guess the law director wants to give a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| We've been working on the subpoena powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| Certainly the commission already has subpoena powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| It's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| It is, let me just read you one little quick portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=157)|
| 0:02:48| We've been working on the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| and we should have the process ready for you next month for the monthly meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| if you want to discuss it further at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| It is, as I stated before, we were looking at the U.S. Senate process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| a process that is tried and true that we could utilize here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| We certainly want to have not only the subpoena powers for them to be fleshed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| for them to be usable, for them to be sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| for them to be enforced if they need to be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| But we want to have a process in place for this body to utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| to make sure that everyone's due process rights are acknowledged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| that we have a fair process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| and that whenever we conduct a 2.02H investigation that, like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| this is something that we've never done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| But when we do, we want to make sure that the investigation is narrowly tailored to a certain subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=238)|
| 0:04:08| that the persons who are investigated know of the charges that basically are being lodged against them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=248)|
| 0:04:20| and that they have a full right to appear, to defend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| as well as if subpoena powers are necessary that those powers, when they are utilized, are enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=265)|
| 0:04:36| Under our charter provision, 2.02H, just quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=276)|
| 0:04:47| it provides that this body has the power to subpoena witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| and to administer oaths where necessary or desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| The question becomes, if you have the power to subpoena witnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| do you also have the power to subpoena documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| Do a subpoena doces tecum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Do you have those powers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Those are the things that we're looking at to better flesh out the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| that the citizens of this county have placed with the Knox County Commission for utilizing Section 2.02H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=319)|
| 0:05:28| We will certainly do our best to have that before you at the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| so that you can go about whichever process it is that you decide to go toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=333)|
| 0:05:44| Well, you know, John, you promised that to us several weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| You said you were tied up in this court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| Yeah, we had a little court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| We had a little court case that lasted about five weeks or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| You said give us, you know, after that, you said you wanted about three to four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| and we still don't have an answer from you yet on how to go about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| It's not only the subpoena powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| It's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| If you don't have a process that's in place that is going to be a fair process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| the Senate process provides that the chair of the committee would be the person who basically ran the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=376)|
| 0:06:30| You all need to vote on the process and, you know, which process it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| You may wish to make some changes to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| But we're going to get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| I thought that's what you were supposed to bring to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| I'm going to bring it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| A couple weeks ago you told us you said give me three or four weeks at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| Yeah, and that might have been overly optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| You know, that's the reason why you haven't come forward with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Well, that's fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| And like I say, that might have been overly optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| But when you're doing something for the first time, Section 2.H investigation, you know, to me it's not kids' play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=418)|
| 0:07:09| It's something that we should take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| And we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| And we're going to make sure whatever procedure it is that we bring this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| that we have a high likelihood that it will be defendable in a court of law because that's ultimately where it may end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=439)|
| 0:07:31| Whatever this body does may end up there very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| Would it be possible if you have us this information to the intergovernmental finance meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| I would certainly shoot for that because that's where we have our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| I will do my best to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| Let me just throw something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| I don't think I'd make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| I don't want to make a motion from the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| Going down this process, I don't know if we could get something done that we could all agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| But certainly over looking at the travel audit, it seems pretty clear to me that if someone got an auto allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=489)|
| 0:08:17| and a county-issued vehicle and gas and everything furnished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| that at least we ought to ask them to repay the money that they received while they had both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| You know, the law director could look at the paychecks and see who got what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| and for how long and issue them a bill to pay within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=512)|
| 0:08:42| So that might be, instead of going through all this process, this might be an easier process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| So, Commissioner, whoever, Hammond, Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Whatever process we have, the public needs to have confidence in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| And you mentioned the Senate hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| First of all, my question with regards to the process is you mentioned charges lodged against an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| Are these charges that we would vote on as a body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Would we have to come in and vote and say, all right, these are the charges that we feel need to be investigated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| You mentioned that it needed to be narrowly tailored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| I think you need to define what your investigation is going to be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| So you need to give, if your subject is Tyler Harbour, then Tyler Harbour needs to be aware of why he's being investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| Is it because, the discussion that I heard, is it because that he is alleged to have worked on campaigns on county time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=572)|
| 0:09:47| Is it because that he was involved in the obtaining of some private information that he should not be privileged to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=587)|
| 0:10:03| Those are the things, I believe, that need to be outlined so that if Tyler Harbour, basically the accused, is brought before this body, that he is able to defend himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=603)|
| 0:10:20| There will be lawyers involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| So as we get together, are we acting as a court of law, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| I mean, are we, will each person have an opportunity to ask questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| That's part of the process, and that is, the process that I bring to you certainly can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=631)|
| 0:10:39| But I want to bring you what I believe is an open and fair process, one that has order, one that certainly observes rules of privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=639)|
| 0:10:52| and one that can be defended as well as enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=652)|
| 0:11:00| It is, you know, it's not as simple as some commissioners or others make it sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=660)|
| 0:11:11| It needs to be, I think, detailed, and that's what we've been trying to do, is come up with a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=671)|
| 0:11:24| We're still tweaking the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Before I bring it to you, before I open it up to public scrutiny, it's going to be right as best we can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=687)|
| 0:11:37| It's going to be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| It's going to be, like I say, legally defendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| And we'll need to discuss it at a meeting, and this body will need to vote on it as to how you wish to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| There may be certain, I'm sure there will be certain provisions that you will want to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=710)|
| 0:11:59| This is not a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Far from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| This is a legislative body that has investigative powers, and you may investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| and as a result of that, you may make certain recommendations based upon that investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| And we would vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| So let's say we go through two or three days of hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| Then it would be up to us to vote to say, all right, we think there's something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| And would it be a majority vote, two-thirds vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Well, it's a two-thirds vote to establish, first of all, your 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| But after that, it's a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| So we would not have any powers to punish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| If you wish to make it a two-thirds vote, you could do that through your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| But what I envision is a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| That's another one of those things to address by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Those things have never been fleshed out because we've never needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| And this is why I like the fact that you're taking your time, because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| public has to have confidence in this if we move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| But if we do find or if the charges are there and someone says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| I make a motion that this charter violation occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| it would be up to us by simple majority to say, yes, we will move forward, or no, we won't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Or you could provide for in your process that it takes a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| You could provide that it takes a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| The process is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| The process will be yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| That's some of the questions that I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| The Attorney General was here a couple of weeks ago and said, guys, if you've got something, bring it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| So that's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I mean, I don't care to do that, but I don't see that as our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| But if it needs to be our job, I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| But if somebody's committed something wrong, let the Sheriff's Department investigate it or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| or this gentleman back here, or auditor or whatever, and take it to the Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| And if he needs to go with it, then they go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| Paula, it looks like we're sort of doing –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| I'm not interested in this Tyler Harberd deal much as I am on the travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| You want our auditor to investigate it, he has investigated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| But if –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| If you had a copy of this, just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Now, you want to know why all this is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| Are you here to read these things out that you found out that I have marked in the case, Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| I've got it, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Read your findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| This is the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Okay, read from the original, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| This is from the final report dated August 17th, which was released on September 10th, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=900)|
| 0:15:11| The first finding was salary improperly reported as travel slash miscellaneous reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=911)|
| 0:15:20| Number two, noncompliance with Knox County compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| Number three, improper W-2 reporting to the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| Number four, payroll procedures were not followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| And those were our findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| On the date we released the report, they're still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| Would you care to get into the thing where you said some of this may be disguised compensation and could possibly be fraud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=946)|
| 0:15:55| Okay, that goes back to number one, salary improperly reported as travel miscellaneous reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| Which is the first finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| They did not conform to the amounts approved in the budget, which violates Section 2553 of the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=966)|
| 0:16:17| Then the elected official cannot receive a vehicle and an allowance, which violates Section 2553 of the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=977)|
| 0:16:28| Then the elected official cannot receive a vehicle and an allowance, which violates Section 2-2 of the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=988)|
| 0:16:40| Number two, noncompliance with Knox County compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| The amount of salary is greater than approved by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| which violates Section 3.04 of Knox County Charter and Section 8-24-102 of Tennessee Code Annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1009)|
| 0:17:02| Would you care to read your recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Okay, recommendations for the first two is refer to the Knox County Law Director for an opinion on whether unlawful acts have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1025)|
| 0:17:17| and if restitution should be made to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| And also refer to the matter to the Knox County Ethics Committee to determine if misconduct and ethics violations have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1041)|
| 0:17:34| Those are your findings, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I'm going to make a motion then that we refer this to the Knox County Law Director for telling us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1058)|
| 0:17:49| Mr. Lord, have we ever summonsed anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| Have we ever subpoenaed anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| No, we've never used the subpoena powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| You're talking about two different things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| You're talking about referring this report to me and you're also talking about subpoena powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| Which is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| Well, we don't have anything on the subpoena powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| so I'd like to put a motion on this to refer this to the law director for guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| whether there's anything criminal, whether we should ask to be reimbursed for this money or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| As far as the subpoena powers go, we'll set that on for discussion next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| And I guess do we need a second to send that on to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| His request for guidance from the law director on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Is there any discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| And are you going to have that back, Mr. Law Director, by next month as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| I mean, I shouldn't take that long to figure out if you had both or you had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| And whenever we get you a law degree, we'll let you make that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| I'll tell you what I'll do then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| I'll make a substitute motion that we ask the law director if someone received a car allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| and a county vehicle because when we approved the budget, it was in there as an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| No matter what you call it afterwards, when I voted to approve the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| it was an auto allowance that we asked the law director to send them a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| They don't pay it within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Files it in Chantry Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Get it out of our hands and get it into the hands of a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| and he can decide if someone needs to pay it back or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Well, do you want to have guidance or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Mr. Law Director, I want to have guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| But, I mean, we've waited and waited and we've got formal audits coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| and we can't seem to get our hands around the first audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| And the first audit is pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Did people get a car allowance and a car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| And if they did, then they're in violation of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| So whatever the audit says, and we know that they did, some people did receive both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| So, I mean, what's so hard about coming up with a solution after six or seven months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| I mean, it's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Before I am able to come back to this body with a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| I have one more visit to make with the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| And then I'll be prepared to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| But until then, I think any motion to ask for court action is premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1245)|
| 0:20:58| I would hope that this body would hold off on any such request as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1258)|
| 0:21:09| until I have one more opportunity to talk with the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| Mr. Chairman, obviously the mayor is involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| I'd like to ask if he has anything he would like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| Perhaps not, but I do want to give you an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Mr. Chairman, I drew the short straw tonight to speak on this issue, and I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| We obviously would like clarification and guidance from the law director's office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| And certainly for those of us that are represented by counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| we have a number of questions including whether or not we will have the right to subpoena witnesses and documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| Certainly I know on my own behalf that would be something we would pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| We had hoped that we would not get to this point and that perhaps through a special called meeting of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| or something of that nature this might otherwise be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| But given that we are here tonight, I would call to your attention a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| I distributed earlier for you a copy of a memorandum from Debbie Young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| in our payroll department to Mr. Arms, Mayor Ragsdale, and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| that outlines certain information that was requested by the Knoxville New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| We have been aware for some time that there is a practice in the sheriff's office of paying Christmas bonuses through overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1344)|
| 0:22:34| I have documentation from payroll that dates the practice back to 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| Let me just interrupt right there, Mr. VanDeVate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| I know you've got that stuff, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| We've got time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| But for one time, can we get through what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| and you can talk about that at the end of the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Because it seems like every time that we come up with something and try to get through one item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| we have to either throw up somebody done something or somebody done something to try to cloudy the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| No, sir, I'm not trying to cloud the waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| In fact, I'm trying to clarify matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Let me be perfectly clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| From 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| employees of the Knox County Sheriff's Office have received Christmas bonuses in the form of overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| overtime that has been paid without documentation of hours worked, overtime that has been paid without work product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| overtime that has been paid without, no, sir, I have the floor, overtime that has been paid as a Christmas bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| I would stipulate to you, sir, that is, at the end of the day, the sheriff's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| He is the elected office holder for that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| This commission passes a budget, and at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| it is the prerogative of that office holder how that budget is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| We do not take issue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| At the same time, we make the point, and this has been our position and this will continue to be our position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| that this body approved a budget for the Knox County Mayor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| It is the mayor's prerogative to set salary for his employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| and at whatever level the mayor sees fit, and he has done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| That position will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| I would call to your attention then, if it is the position of some commissioners that it is the sheriff's prerogative to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1461)|
| 0:24:31| undocumented overtime in the form of Christmas bonuses to his employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| but it is not the mayor's prerogative to supplement the salary of his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| then I would call to your attention section 3.03 of the charter, which states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| see that all provisions of this charter, resolutions, ordinances, and emergency ordinances of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| and all applicable laws of the state of Tennessee subject to execution by Knox County are faithfully executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| If, in fact, your contention is that what the mayor has done by setting the salary for his employees is wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1500)|
| 0:25:09| then we will be calling upon this body for a 202 investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| as is the mayor's right, of the practice of paying overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| for Christmas bonuses to employees of the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| Gentlemen, you can't have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Okay, Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Now, can we get back to what we're here for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| What's your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Can we stick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| I mean, I want to be civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| I'm just trying to come up with a solution that everyone can live with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| and this commission can come to some kind of an agreement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Is there nothing personal against Mr. Vanderveet or no one else in the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| But at some point in time, just me speaking and no one else, if you talk about the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1551)|
| 0:25:59| Chief Spangler is here, I think, but in the line item, was it budgeted for overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| or was it budgeted for an auto lounge or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| Or how was it in the sheriff's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| I assume there was a global budget for salary and benefits and it's paid out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| And I don't take issue with it, commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| I think it's the sheriff's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Okay, so under what you believe, if we approve an auto lounge for the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| and you all have cars that we, you know, we may, when I voted for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| I thought it would be someone up there like a Cynthia Finch that didn't have a car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| that we were paying overtime, I mean, paying the car lounge to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| And we come to find out, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| we're paying it to the people who have a car or two or three people that have cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| Is it your belief, then, we should just not say nothing and you all just spend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| Is that your belief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| It is my belief that it is the prerogative of every office holder in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| And, commissioner, there are issues of this nature in the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| in the register of deeds office, in the sheriff's office, in the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| Every office holder in this building invokes his or her prerogative to set salaries for their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| Now, obviously, we can take issue with the execution of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| You take issue with the fact that the mayor reflected salary supplements for his employees under travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| Others might take issue with the payment of Christmas bonuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| under the auspices of overtime that clearly hasn't been worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| But at the end of the day, if that office holder does not exceed his or her budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| that is approved by this legislative body, it is their prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| So what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Why does finance have the line item transfers, transferring from one account to another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| If they live within their budget, why do we need to see line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| Let's just do away with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| As long as they stay within their budget, we shouldn't care how they spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| I am saying that the salary and benefits for employees of various county offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| are set at the discretion of those office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| At the end of the day, if those office holders do not expend more money than this body has budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| they've been selected by the people to run their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| Let them run their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Mr. VanDeVeet, you work for the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| I'm sure you got some of that overtime pay at one time or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| Oh, yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Was this reported on your income tax and you paid withholding on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| Yes, sir, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Why in the travel allowance was it not reported on everybody's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| I can only speak for myself on that one, Commissioner, but it was reported and I did pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Why was not these other people's paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| If it was a salary supplement and it was in your salary, why was withholding not held on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| Commissioner, I'd have to direct that to Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| I can only speak for myself on that issue, but mine was reported as income and taxes were paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Mr. Troyer, why was tax not paid on this if it was in their salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| W-2s and tax returns have been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| They've been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| When were they amended, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| They have been since Mr. Walsh has done his investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| So taxes have been reported on all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| The office has been going on, the travel allowance in the mayor's office has been going on since 19-I mean 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1757)|
| 0:29:28| Christmas bonus is under the form of overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| But there's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| It's been going on since at least 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| I don't know, but Mr. Vanderbate, that's still, you could say it was their salary because they didn't hold out taxes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| These travel allowances since 2003, there has been no withholding on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| Speaking for myself and I believe for Mr. Arms and Mr. Warner, I believe, who obviously is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| I received the salary supplement for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| I believe Mr. Arms received it for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| And I believe that Mr. Warner received it for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| Mr. Hooks has been established with the previous position, so his may have had a longer duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| At the end of the day, Commissioner, this body doesn't regulate taxation, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| That, with all due respect, I think that's a matter between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| I believe it's the way it's reported in payroll, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| I believe that's a matter between the employee and the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| You know, I find that very strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| Everybody I ever worked for me, I was required to withhold income tax on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| Was there any difference in county employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| And Mr. Warner got a travel allowance since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| I've got his records back to 05s, and I've called for everybody else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| And he started at $165.38 every pay period for a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1844)|
| 0:30:53| Now, I don't know who approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| And he may very well have, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| I don't have firsthand knowledge of Mr. Warner's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| I can only speak to mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| You know, that come out of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| And, John, if you're over payroll, I want to tell you this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| You need to watch it because everything I have gotten has had the people's social security number on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| So you really need to have that blacked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I mean, I'm just putting that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| But I have proof from finance or the payroll department that these things started back as far back as 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| Now, I haven't got back any further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Again, Commissioner, it's our position that it is the prerogative of the office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| If this body takes issue with this position and goes forward with the 202 hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| certainly we'll cooperate in every way that we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| We will, however, call for a 202 hearing of this particular practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| And we will also want and expect an investigation of how salaries are handled in the other fee offices as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| Mr. Troyer, who is responsible for withholding on a salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1918)|
| 0:32:11| Who is responsible for withholding the income tax for the federal government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| The county is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Then what you're saying is then that the county is responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| could be held liable for all this travel allowance that we've paid that there has been no withholding on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| There has been withholding on all of it, and it's all been reported to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| When?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| This year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| This year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| And you've checked all the way back to 2003, and it's been paid on that far back too, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| We went back to 2003, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Now, were there any penalties, charges on that or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| There have been no penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| There have been no penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Well, if it was legitimate to begin with, why wasn't the taxes held out on it, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1977)|
| 0:33:10| I think that we have better reporting now, and it's been reported correctly now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| In other words, you're saying people's salary was not reported correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| And I think it's been reported correctly now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Well, you're saying now, but it's after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| It was amended, and it was amended back to the times in question, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2006)|
| 0:33:35| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| A quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| This that you just passed out, I'm looking at one of these here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Try to help me understand this with what you come out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| I do not believe I know her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| I've got this bottom thing down here highlighted, 37 hours overtime showing $2,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2026)|
| 0:33:56| When they start raising it, you're saying that this $2,100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| that this lady never worked any overtime at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Or is this just pure bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Or is she going to come back and say, hey, I really worked 30 and seven hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| There are a couple of issues on the table, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| If you take the more complete record and you look back through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| you will see a mix of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| You will see rank and file employees, for instance, in the narcotics unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| who have probably worked extensive hours of overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| But then you will see exempt employees who are straight salary employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| who will always receive a fixed amount of overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| or a certain amount of overtime in the payroll immediately preceding the Christmas holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| This is an established pattern that goes back, as Commissioner Pinkston has alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| I received overtime one Christmas when I was at the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| So my response to that was thank you very much to the Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| These are salary people then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| That list you have are salaried people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| And the reason that list is composed as you see it is because that was in response to a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| for information from the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| We have more complete payroll records going back to 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| but the request you have there was responses to the new Sentinel's query to payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2109)|
| 0:35:20| Mr. Chairman, what is the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| I think I had a substitute motion on the floor to direct the law director to send them a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| if they had a car allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Did you receive a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| That's what I'm waiting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Did we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| Scott, can I ask for clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| You said something about sending a chance report too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| What I'm saying is, and I don't know who all had a county car and received a car allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| but if they certainly received both of them at the same time that we just get the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| with the finance people, see how many received it and what they received in their checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| and if they had a car during that time, then pay the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| We'll send them a bill that they pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| And if they didn't, I guess you'd need to file a suit and chance report or some court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| unless we decide we want to let them pay it back over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| or take a little bit out of a check each paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| You have a travel policy, I know, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| I do not have it committed to memory, but I have read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| But whereabouts, and I believe it specifies in the travel policy that you cannot eat in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2193)|
| 0:36:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| It might very well, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I'd have to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Well, now, we've amended the travel allowance part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| Are we amending all the meals that they've eaten here, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Does that go in as a salary too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Well, why, when our travel policy says that they can't eat in Knox County on the taxpayer, have they been eating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2230)|
| 0:37:22| It says they have to be out of town overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| We have a travel policy that tells how much you pay per diem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| We have how much you're allowed for meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| The first day you're not allowed as much and the last day you're not allowed as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| But we've had people that have been eating on Knox County taxpayer dollars here in strict violation of the travel policy for several years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2256)|
| 0:37:46| We're talking about a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| Why was that not reported as a salary supplement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| I think we're skipping ahead to the next audit, and we were on the travel audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| I think Mr. Walls is still working on that, and I think the appropriate time to discuss that is after this report is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| You're talking about the P cards, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| That's what he's still working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| I think that the best response is to wait until Mr. Walls issues his report, and I think we'll respond in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| Commissioner Pinkham, let's see if we can just keep our attention for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| This is on the travel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| I believe if you'll talk to Mr. Walls here that he'll tell you that the travel policy states that nobody can eat in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2305)|
| 0:38:33| Is that not correct, Mr. Walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| If they're not getting reimbursed for food if they eat in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| You're correct when the travel policy states that meals will only be reimbursed when you travel overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2321)|
| 0:38:51| I would ask if that would extend to the meals that this commission eats every month outside this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| because those are out of the jail budget and they are directly paid for with public money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| Gentlemen, I know we can sit here, we can point fingers all night long, and we usually do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| And we get nothing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Mr. Chairman, this has been a very long wait for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| I mean, I don't care if we ever look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| But I guarantee you that I think on this next budget that we do it very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| Budget clarity and proper accounting for all expenditures are, I think, universally agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| But I think at some point we have to stop waiting for a second and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Well, I'm not on the second anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| What motion is on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| I'll give him a second just to keep it alive because I want to ask a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| You've got to ask your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| I'd like to ask mine, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Actually, I haven't asked any, but you're welcome to, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| But the thing is, if we can just focus tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| and Mr. Vanderbate, if you've got a list of people who have done wrong, let's write them down and we'll get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| But tonight let's try to focus on this auto allowance because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| I think we need to clear this one audit up and move on one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| You very well may not have to pay nothing back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| The commission may say, Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| And if they do, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| But let's not throw any more things other than let's talk about the travel allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| that you all received while you had a county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Now, if we can do that, I would be very much appreciated to the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| and to the commission if we can all just keep to that one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| We'll do our level best, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Try to be civil if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Simply give us a single, clear, and concise set of rules consistently applied to all offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| We'll get to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| I've got it written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| We'll get to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| If he's done something wrong, we'll get to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| But right now, tonight, let's finish this auto allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| and let's see if we can get something resolved so we don't have to hear it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| If we could do that, it would be a Merry Christmas doll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| I would like to say one thing about eating back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| I haven't brought anybody in and let them eat the county food except me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| And I certainly haven't eaten $687 worth back here in four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Right now I'd like to wait for John's recommendation myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| but I'm going to ask a two-part question here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| and I think it goes before we second vote on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| And one of Dwight and one of John is that if you get a recommendation for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| to send him a bill before you talk to the comptroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| and then I guess my question out here would be, what are you going to do when you get the bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2504)|
| 0:41:51| I mean, we can vote all night or we can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| If you file a, I don't know, a chancery court, they get 30 days to reply, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| So you're talking 30, 60 more days on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| I'm just wondering, if you get instructions from us to send him a bill, what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| And then if you get it, you may not be prepared to answer that tonight, but what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| I think the first thing I'm going to do, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| is wait and see if you send one to all these folks too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| Before I finish with my work, I'm going to talk to the comptroller one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2541)|
| 0:42:29| And then I'll have an answer for you as far as my opinion of the travel audit that was performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| The travel audit that was performed was done by Mr. Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| certainly with the oversight of the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| There are some issues, I believe, that still need to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| and that's what I'm going to go about doing when I talk with the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| Well, I guess I'm ready to support Paul's first motion to send it over to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| but if you're not going to do anything and they're not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Sending it over to me certainly is the proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| Whether you send it to me or not, that's what I intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| If this body wishes to take some action tonight, I'm telling you that's what I intend to do, whether you take action or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2591)|
| 0:43:22| And you will have it to us for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| What I told you was, Commissioner, is that I would have you as quickly as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| and hopefully by the committee meetings is the process by which this committee can go about exercising its 202H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2611)|
| 0:43:40| including the subpoena powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| And I haven't given you a timeline for the travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2622)|
| 0:43:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Are you done, Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Commissioner Lambert and Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2638)|
| 0:44:06| First of all, I'm really confused by these numbers, just like R. Larry was on the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2646)|
| 0:44:16| I would think if this was a Christmas bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| Mr. Commissioner Lambert, let's wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| You can ask those questions in a little bit, but let's focus on what is at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Well, I'll ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| What is it if we just called the salary enhancement, if we just called them an auto allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2672)|
| 0:44:40| which is what I understand is that you just put that name on them so there would be a line for them within payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2680)|
| 0:44:49| If that was appropriate, why did you end the travel allowances when this became an issue instead of just going ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2689)|
| 0:44:58| and going with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Why did you change if this was appropriate and if there was nothing wrong with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| Commissioner's sentiment on the matter was pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| We did discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| And, again, as I outlined in a memo to this body, and I don't recall the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2714)|
| 0:45:22| the item was reflected for vegetary purposes in the Lawson system because there really was no other way to reflect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| Is it ideal execution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| That notwithstanding, it seemed like the appropriate choice at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Well, I mean, I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| It was controversial then and it's controversial now, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| It, quite frankly, isn't worth the headaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| I'm really struggling with this one because if I don't vote to ask you all to pay the money back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2747)|
| 0:45:56| you know, I'll be accused of not looking after the taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| But if I do vote to ask you all to pay the money back, I mean, I'm sure that your family has already spent the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| I'm sure that everyone who received these checks and thought that they were appropriate at the time, whether they were or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| I mean, if you're like your typical American family, you've spent the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| And so I have a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| I just don't know what to do on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| I want to look after the taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| But at the same time, I believe that when you receive these checks, whether they were appropriate or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2784)|
| 0:46:32| you thought they were appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| And I'm really torn on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| I don't see any easy decision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Let me go to Commissioner Luthold and then we'll come back to you, Commissioner Fink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Mr. Lambert, I do agree with a little bit of what you said there about, you know, an employee receiving compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| and their boss tells them, you know, here's your pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| And as far as you know, everything's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| And to ask them to pay that back, that's a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| So I agree with you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| It's a hard question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| I guess my, really what I turned my light on was to ask the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| let's say we go through a process of subpoenaing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| and we vote that a charter violation occurred or something down that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2854)|
| 0:47:46| What authority or power do we have as a commission to impose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2866)|
| 0:47:55| I mean, just because we slam our gavel down and say guilty, if that's what we end up doing, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2875)|
| 0:48:08| The powers of this body as a legislative body are that you can certainly direct your legal counsel to pursue certain matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2888)|
| 0:48:22| as a result of an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| You can certainly publicly censure your own members if you had a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| You can make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| But I think your true power as far as enforcement lies with my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2919)|
| 0:48:50| and ultimately directing my office to, if not investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2930)|
| 0:49:03| to complete the process of your investigation and pursue court action if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| There are a number of ways that you could certainly address any type of matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2951)|
| 0:49:20| When it comes to these audits, and we have four audits that are going to be following up the travel audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2960)|
| 0:49:31| they're each going to come with their own set of findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| These are findings that have been worked over, have been discussed extensively by both our audit team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2976)|
| 0:49:45| as well as the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| I have tremendous faith in the comptroller's office as well as Mr. Walls and his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| But when I follow up on that, first of all, I'm not an accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| So I still have some questions that remain as to that travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| And then I'll be making my opinion known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| I'll bring that to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| If this body has any other questions it wishes to ask, it can certainly conduct a 2.02H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| and try to get answers to those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| But ultimately, your authority lies within your direction of my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| or in basically disciplining your own members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3033)|
| 0:50:41| If you had a member that had issues with the county charter or our ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3041)|
| 0:50:56| So the best we would do is ask your office to proceed with whatever legal remedy we think is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3056)|
| 0:51:08| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| In a case like this, you know, it's been a couple of years on some of the issues that have been audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3070)|
| 0:51:22| It is my belief, certainly my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| We have been successful with this rationale before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| We believe that it's well-settled law that the time does not run against the king.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| The time does not run against the county as far as the statute of limitations for recouping monies that are due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3098)|
| 0:51:47| that are owing to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Nullum tempest accurt regi, I believe, is the Latin phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| Basically, the time does not run against us and we could pursue any action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| whether that action occurs in January or whether it occurs in May or June or whenever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| for any matter that's occurred certainly over the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| Well, let's say, for instance, let's say the money is due back, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| And we find that it was improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| They should pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| I guess you would send them a bill or some directive to pay X number of dollars back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3146)|
| 0:52:36| And I guess they have the option to pay it or contest it in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| It may be that the county would need to seek its due, if it were due, through a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3164)|
| 0:52:55| That implies to employees or ex-employees or whoever that owes the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3175)|
| 0:53:03| We have, over the past year, recouped monies that are due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3183)|
| 0:53:11| and owing the county in the thousands of dollars through my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| It's something that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| It's another aspect of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| I guess I've got one question, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| We've got all these audits coming out and we can't seem to get our hands on the first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| if we do anything or not, to try to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| And I think that's what people were expecting us to do in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Our citizens want us to either say that it was proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| and we need to close it and move on, or if we need restitution, we might need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| We've got to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| If your office, if you're, I don't want to say too busy is the word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| but do we need to hire maybe an attorney for us just on these audits to tell us what we should do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3236)|
| 0:54:05| And that way they could just concentrate their time on these audits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| and they could be here to advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| You didn't like my statement about that attorney comment, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| No, I do like it, but we've been here for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| And, I mean, if we need to get somebody to help us get through these other four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| I mean, I think we need to do it in a reasonable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| Oh, I do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| And that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| And hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| But the old commission we had on here, the ones that were appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| we had a meeting about the 202 and we said something like 30 days we would have another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| And now we've been two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Just real quick, there's a question I wanted to ask of Richard Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| Richard, we have other audits still pending, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| And when do you anticipate those to be finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3301)|
| 0:55:10| And when will we get those reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Any ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| The work on the PCARD and the hospitality account is mostly done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| and we're currently working with the state on the draft of the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| And once we finalize the draft, we'll bring it to the mayor's office for comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3325)|
| 0:55:34| and we normally give them two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| So hopefully in the month of January we would be able to give the draft to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| So hopefully within about a month on those two reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| And then at that point is when we would start the work on the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| We would probably start in early January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| You would start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| On the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| So you hadn't even started on the community grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| I know that your plate is full, but I didn't realize you hadn't even started on the one audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| We've done some preliminary planning but have not started the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| And how long do you think you would need as far as that audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| A month, two months, three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| Probably the work would take roughly a month and then probably possibly a month in the work on the report itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3386)|
| 0:56:34| So probably sometime in February, early March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| And maybe we don't need to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| But we need some direction from this commission to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| We don't need Mr. Walz and the state, paying the state to come in here and do these audits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| if we're just going to close the book and never look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| And we've got that warrant and we don't seem to be doing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| I mean, we don't need to be wasting more taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| And Mr. Walz's time, let's just, if we need to, let's just cut them off and say we don't need no more audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3428)|
| 0:57:17| I mean, but we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| I mean, I don't want to waste people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Mr. Vannovate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Just a couple points along those lines, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| I think if you'll check with Mr. Walz, he will say that on a number of the findings in the travel audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| we did note that management concurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| Also, Mr. Arms reminded me that we simply let the salary supplements run out with the end of the 07 fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3453)|
| 0:57:45| We're presently in the 08 fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| So we didn't actually terminate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| We simply didn't include them in the budget that we're presently operating under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| Commissioner Pinkston and then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Yeah, this is to answer Commissioner Lambert's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| Are you wanting to know why, if this was a travel allowance, why they put it over in the salary supplement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3482)|
| 0:58:10| Is that not your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Well, what I ask was, is that if this was appropriate, why did they stop doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| And apparently I believe their answer is, is because we expressed a dissatisfaction with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| So do I hear you right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| You're not saying that you did anything wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| You're just saying that to avoid the controversy you won't do it in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| That's eloquently said and completely accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Here is a statement from John Warner, who was a finance director at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3518)|
| 0:58:46| On May the 24th, during the budget hearings, John Warner testified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| the allowance is for unreimbursed travel expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| Example, cigars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| Now, so you can't say, here's the finance director says it was a travel allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| but yet we were furnishing him in a car and all the gas that he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| Now, Mr. Vanderbate, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I'm going to concur with you on you're not drawing that travel allowance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| But I believe, sir, that you all withdrew that on June the 14th of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3561)|
| 0:59:30| when the mayor agreed to take it from you, is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| I don't recall that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| All I can say with specificity is that it did run, for me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| through the last payroll of the 2007 fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| And that ended July the 1st, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| It would have ended June the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| June the 30th, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| But June the 14th is when it stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| That's when the mayor came down here and said that he was cutting it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| Paul, Mr. Pinkston, I believe that that was the day that we took up the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| And in order to pass the budget, I believe that was something that the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| or his staff came forward and said that that wasn't going to be part of the budget for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| That's how I recall it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| It was on the day of the budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| I think that was the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| But they were exposed June the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| The 14th, we had a budget hearing down here, and the mayor came down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| And I may have the list of things here that he told he was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| And then it was taken out of the budget when we voted in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Yeah, I could be wrong, but if my memory serves me right, I think it happened on the day that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| or right about the day that we approved the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| the mayor came down and said that as part of the budget he was proposing, it would not include those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3648)|
| 1:00:59| I believe on June the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| I've got his records on at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| And I don't remember if that was the day that we approved the budget or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| I don't know either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| But June the 14th, the mayor came down and told what he was doing on the P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| He told what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| That he was going to withdraw that travel allowance and these things taking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| You know, we get this tonight and evidently there's some more out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| And I have always said from day one is I want to be fair with everybody in all office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| And if there's other salary people getting this, you know, guys, I'm for let's see what we've got before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| And then let Mr. Owens, what he was saying, let a law director see what every office holder is doing and who's getting what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3701)|
| 1:01:49| That's a complete audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| We're just piecemealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Let's do everything, all Knox County, all the office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| John tells us what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| And then we'll see who gets a whipping and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Well, Mr. Smith, we have to take these offices one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| I mean, we can't take them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Hang on just a minute, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| And when we get finished with this one, we'll ask him to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| And if he feels like he wants to respond to this right here, he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| Mr. Chairman, we've got a gentleman standing behind Mr. Vanovick for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| I was wondering if maybe we could allow him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Do you have something to say, sir, on the audits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| I don't have anything to say on the audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| First of all, I hate to interrupt you, but if you'll give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| My name is Mike Simpson, and I live at 5547 Woodburn Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| I've been in the same house for 42 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| Before I reached the people over there, I was a professor at the University of Tennessee in political science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3770)|
| 1:02:59| And I don't think it's any wonder that we might be a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| We've been here for six hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| You've been here for longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| I've been here for six hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| And it's no wonder that public citizens have dwindled in size and number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3795)|
| 1:03:27| You've sort of wandered around until finally you've gotten to the question of what is going on in the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3807)|
| 1:03:36| Most of the time you seem to me to be sort of stumbling your way toward some kind of agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3816)|
| 1:03:48| But I've been waiting to maybe take a chance at the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| I hadn't really made up my mind to do that, but public forum is item number 15, and I don't think you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3833)|
| 1:04:02| Yeah, we haven't got to public forum yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| I can't tell whether you're on 11 or 12 or which part of those, but you seem to me to have become not a deliberating body, but a sort of a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3844)|
| 1:04:21| And I'm as confused as the rest of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| Yes, sir, if you'll give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| My name is Joe Minichiello, and I'm at 311 Lindy Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| And I know it's late, but what I hear is someone saying, because you stole, it was okay for me to steal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3877)|
| 1:04:47| I don't want people to just pay the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| I want them to be punished for being thieves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| I don't believe that the IRS did not assess a penalty for false reporting of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3895)|
| 1:05:03| If you and I made false reports on our income tax, we'd be liable to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| Why is Knox County any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| You have to hold these people's feet to the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| My money is being wasted, and that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| It seems everybody in the government thinks it's their money to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| You had a car, and you had a travel allowance, and you collected both, and that's not stealing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3926)|
| 1:05:33| Well, then we have to get a new definition of the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| But thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| It's just, you know, more and more I sit through these things and hear people say it's very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3938)|
| 1:05:46| And I'm disturbed by it because I think there's a moral flaw, a serious moral flaw in this government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3946)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| So I don't know where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| We're on an amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| We're on your motion because Commissioner Lambert seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| Just to keep the discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| If we ain't going to do nothing, I'll just withdraw it and I won't say nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| But I don't think we ought to be wasting money on any other audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| And I think if we go down this road, let's just go ahead and tell Mr. Walz and call the state and tell them to cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| I mean, we don't need to waste people's money if we're not going to pay attention to the audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| And if this commission wants to just say Merry Christmas and do better next year, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| But, you know, I don't want to waste two or three hours of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| In my mind, it's something that can be so simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| If I were in a business, I would straighten it up in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| And, you know, that's my feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| But do whatever we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| I believe the law directors tell me, and it's the way I remember it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| is an amended 909 to ask the law director to give us guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4014)|
| 1:07:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| I think we already had it seconded, but thank you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| And I'm going to call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| Resolution 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Since something was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Sheriff Sprangler, acting sheriff, do you want to say something about your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4046)|
| 1:07:37| I'd like to, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| I'm just, I guess I should say as I'm the chief deputy discharging the duties of sheriff, as it says in TCA 88107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4059)|
| 1:07:49| So this is relatively new to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| I've been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| I guess the thing that I want to say is I guess I'm disappointed that we have to be brought into other people's problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| And I don't, as far as the officers, I don't appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| As Dwight said, Dwight Vanderbate said earlier about the overtimes and the bonuses, yeah, he benefited from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| Everybody's benefited from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| The thing about it is we've come to commission on our overtime and you approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| We haven't gone outside of anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| Also, the one thing that needs to be reiterated is the fact that when he mentioned that the new sentinel called him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| unless one of the ladies in my office has told me a fabrication that Dwight called the new sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| and gave that information because she admitted that Dwight had called her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| So, you know, I don't want to get up here and throw stones, but I want to make sure we defend ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| because we as a sheriff's office and the officers up there have done nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4124)|
| 1:08:52| I will promise you this, that I will, first thing in the morning, that if that's the way it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| then I will reopen the Tyler Harbor case myself and make sure we've not missed anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| But don't come up here throwing us into the middle of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| especially somebody who's trying to make sure that this department continues to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| You know, maybe they got upset because of what happened last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| requesting the files on the Tyler Harbor and the PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| Maybe they got upset because I allowed that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| But if any one of you all send a letter up to me requesting something, that's what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| But I'm not going to stand up here and have our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| and our department manhandled for something we've not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| These men and women are proud officers of this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| We're not going to deface them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| I've been up here for over 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| There's no need for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| We need to all get over it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| I enforce the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| The officers enforce the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| There are laws we all have to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| There's laws that you go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| And, by God, we better start going by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| I'm sorry that I've gotten upset, but it bothers me that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| I take it very, very personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| Chief or sheriff or whatever, I don't know what to call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| You really were in a limbo on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| The tax was held out and reported to payroll on these Christmas bonuses or overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| or whatever you want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| The people did pay the withholding on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Well, now, you correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| A new Sentinel reporter called me, and I didn't want to talk to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| and I talked to him for just a few moments anyway, but then let him talk to my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| And I asked him what the policy was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| They read the county policy there down there, and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| looks like this could be done at the sheriff's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| And I said, well, what's the story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| You know, if you haven't done anything wrong, either you've done anything wrong or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| it seems to me like you followed county policy, you reported it to payroll as income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| and then withholding was held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Now, there's a difference in breaking policy and not withholding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| Now, that's where you come in up here and you operate correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| You get your line item transfers for the overtime pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| and they're either granted we voted for them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| Can anybody tell me here that they voted for line item transfer for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4285)|
| 1:11:33| You know, we've been getting a lot of things up here, and that's why in finance now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| I want the reason why you're changing that instead of just numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| But you have obeyed the law, but yet you're saying you're like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| But I'm like the gentleman back there in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| because this guy over here stealing does not give me the right to steal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| I agree with him 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Did you say you lived on Lindy Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| Well, I thought you must have a little common sense then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| I can understand why I've been in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| But I'm like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| I don't think you should have even been drug into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| And I'm sure that the gentleman standing behind you there is the one that's been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| Everything that they've come out with on the sheriff's department so far has been done like it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| We have policies and rules that we're supposed to abide by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| and the executive branch up there is brokering every guideline that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| And I would have thought that the law director, when this audit comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| of course I'm not a lawyer now, I'm not going to say he comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| and the auditor says it looks like fraud or disguised compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| I would have thought that would have been enough for him to look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Doc, we've got charges here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| But, anyway, that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| Mr. Chairman, if I might, Tom Spangler is a good and honorable man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| And when he speaks, he speaks from the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| And I believe that he believes what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| But, for the record, I have had no contact with anyone from the sheriff's office regarding this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| And I have had no contact with anybody from the news sentinel regarding this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| This request came to Ms. Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Mr. Troyer made me aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| And we are, as Chief Spangler is, obligated by law to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| With regard to the gentleman who spoke earlier, you know, we could debate that all night long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| but my definition of overtime is hours worked beyond 40 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| These folks were paid at the discretion of the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| As I have stated, I believe that's the sheriff's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| But there is no question that there were not hours worked for many of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| that were reflected on this list who received the December bonuses from the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| If you'll look through this record, we'll make it available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| You will see other employees throughout the year who have worked extra hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| and you have actually worked hours that relate to the monies that they were paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| But the bonus practice is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| The record is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| And from our standpoint, the sheriff's right to bonus his employees at Christmastime is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4454)|
| 1:14:21| And we see a distinction that you're drawing that we don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| You've got anybody else that's done anything wrong that you know of today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| Just real quick, and I'll leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Yeah, I do speak from the heart, and I'm sure Dwight does too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| But I'll speak up here for myself and make it very clear that if he, Dwight, did not call the reporter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4478)|
| 1:14:46| then the reporter lied to our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| So she's the one who made the comment that our girl did that Dwight sure is working awful hard, isn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4488)|
| 1:14:58| And she made the comment, yes, he is, and he's giving me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| So let's leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Mr. Chairman, can we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| We have other items that we need to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4510)|
| 1:15:18| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| Resolution 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| This is approving an addendum to a contract with Tax Management Associates, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| for business personal property audit services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Took no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| Lack of a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| You know, I don't know if this costs us money why we may not need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| I've got a question, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| I mean, we don't have a second yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Okay, second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| Go ahead, Commissioner LeTobio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Mr. Troyer, is this where an audit firm is coming back behind the property assessor's personal property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4560)|
| 1:16:14| to make sure that the assessment is correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| And is this part of the mandated by the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| This is the firm who is doing that mandated work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| and what this proposal is is to propose work in addition to the work that you described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| to review the pilots and the TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| So they're going to review pilots and TIFs on top of reviewing personal property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| And how much are we paying them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| I think the proposal is $4,000 per audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| We pay them $4,000 per audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| And how much were we paying the firm before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| Because we had a different firm before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| You know, I don't have those numbers committed to memory, but it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| But it's a flat rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| It's a flat rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| It's not an amount that's tied to them increasing someone's assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4631)|
| 1:17:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| It doesn't matter how big or how small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| It could be a one-man operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| It could be a 1,000-man operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| Still $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| How do we know that they're going to do the larger firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| and not just do a whole bunch of small ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| Because I'm sure they're a lot more profitable for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Is there something built in that they have to do a certain mix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| I understand there's a total population of 26 to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| So there's 26 they can do from zero to 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| That's just for the pilots and the TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4680)|

| 1:18:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| Mr. Leuthold, I can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| They already do the personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| They do the personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| This is an amendment to that to do the 24, 26 TIFs and pilots that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| This is only to do an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| That was approved by the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| and I think next year they'll have it mandatory that counties do these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| It's your confidence that the people who receive pilots and TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| are doing what they've agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| Well, it just says in the caption here, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| for personal property audit service, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| Yeah, but it's an amendment to what they already do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| To what they're already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Is that 4,000 for the 4,000 apiece for 26?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| I think that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Yeah, $100,000, $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| Four times 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4752)|

| 1:19:39| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| What does this do with Roto-Framas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| Are they continuing with their contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Their contract goes through June 30th of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| so they would do this year's audit, which they wouldn't be eligible to do next year's anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| I don't think that's what this says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| What this Rothford Moss right now is working on last year's audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| Because you go through a year, then you audit it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| So if we're going to have the current budget year that we're working on audited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| what we're saying is that with this, we're saying the state will do it, not Rothford Moss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4816)|
| 1:20:24| Well, I think we need to look at probably 2008-2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| That would be correct because we have a contract with Rothford Moss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| And plus, I believe John there told me, you correct me on this, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| it will take the state a little while to get set up to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| But in the long run, this will be cheaper for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| So it needs to be amended to say 2008-2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Let's amend it to 2008-2009, and that keeps Rothford Moss in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| and then they would not be eligible to bid on the contract again anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| So it doesn't affect those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| We probably do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| We probably do in case the state can't get to this 2008-2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| We probably need to have bids ready to send out just in case after John talks to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| Does Rothford Moss have a contract per our charter that we have to approve every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| Do they have a contract to do next year's audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| I'll have to review their contract and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Our charter calls for that we have to approve that contract every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| We cannot grant a four-year contract no matter what we think we are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| And this past year we certainly did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| We went back in retro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| Well, here again I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with you, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| because our charter plainly states that we have to approve the audit firm on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4910)|
| 1:22:01| They can only have it up to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| They can have it one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| They can have it two, three, or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| They can't have it five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| But we can still only approve those audits one year at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| And I don't think we approve next year's audit of this current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4932)|
| 1:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| That's a question I have is how far up do we go with these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| Do we need to postpone this until we find that answer out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Because I agree with Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| You know, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| See what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| I don't have their contract in front of me, but, you know, 1115 at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| It's up in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| I can go get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Well, this isn't something that we have to necessarily vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| We could defer this until next month, Paul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| If you're talking about the audit for 08-09, that's, you know, we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| I'm going to be going to talk to the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| And while I'm there, why don't I inquire about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| and see if they would be ready for next year or for the 07-08 tax year or for the 08-09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=4997)|
| 1:23:28| And in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| I'll look at the Rotter from Moss contract and see what we're committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| I'm like Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| I believe that we granted that for four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| but we have the option whether or not to renew something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| because you know they're not going to do it for the same money every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| Well, Commissioner Pinkson, we ain't going to get nothing decided tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| so let's just do it off until next month and hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| I'll withdraw my motion and make a motion to just defer this until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| The comptroller will tell us something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5041)|

| 1:24:03| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Guys, it's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5044)|

| 1:24:07| No, let's try to get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5047)|

| 1:30:11| I'm not trying to say that it's any perfect faith that I'm asking people to stay up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5411)|

| 1:30:21| He may not have meant it, but it's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| I admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| I admit it freely, and I said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| And if any of you got any money in your pockets you don't want, on the back of the money it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5427)|

| 1:30:35| I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| I'll put it to good use for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| We've got a similar belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| What did you say, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| I was asking if he would be amenable to instead of saying urging all American citizens to proclaim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| urging all American citizens who have similar beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| In other words, some people may not believe this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| and I don't want to make them feel like that we're trying to impose this on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| But if you do believe this and you have similar beliefs, then you feel free to express that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| I will try to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| And who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Is that okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| Commissioner Nolman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| Again, this is a very difficult issue for a lot of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| I certainly have respect for Commissioner Harmon, Ivan Harmon, for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| He obviously has a deep-felt desire to express his faith in a public setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5496)|
| 1:31:46| As far as I can tell, we've been warned in our Judeo-Christian faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| to be wary of public people expressing their faith to obviously in public places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5512)|
| 1:32:00| because they want to be seen and heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| And I by no means do I suggest that Ivan's trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| But I really have, and we share the same faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| which I'm sure we could go to church together and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| but still it shows how I'm trying to go, well, who is this good for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5536)|
| 1:32:26| And I cannot, I just can't come to the belief that it is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5546)|
| 1:32:37| or he's pleased by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| Maybe he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| But, again, I probably am not going to vote to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| but not because I don't believe Ivan has good intentions offering it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5568)|
| 1:32:57| Vice Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| I'm not going to support this resolution for the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| It keeps coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| This is the third time we've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| We tabled it once and it came back up after a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| Since I've been on this commission three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Don't interrupt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| But, anyway, I think it should be a separation between church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| and state and what I believe is my beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| I don't think I need to push what I believe on someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| So I'm voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| It has been three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Okay, Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Yes, this is a real difficult choice for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| I probably believe in the motion because that's the way that I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| I say also a separation of state and church that we all recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| And, you know, America is the melting pot of so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5639)|
| 1:34:07| And the point that I would like to bring out most of all that I don't think anybody is overlooking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| is so many has died worldwide fighting for all of our liberties and freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5655)|
| 1:34:23| And certainly one of those freedoms is our right to worship or religious freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| or whatever catchphrase that you want to use on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| I sort of recognize the resolution and I'm more comfortable with Mr. Hammond's wording of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| but I don't want to lose sight of so many people that has died for these freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| And, you know, it is a personal choice, as Tank has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| It's a personal choice for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| So I'm even confused now if I'll support it or not because it is such a personal choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5693)|
| 1:35:03| Okay, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| I co-sponsored this amendment and I support this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| and I plan on voting for this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| And one of the best things that have come out of this amendment are all of the wonderful conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5714)|
| 1:35:22| that I've had from folks who practiced a different faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| I have been contacted by atheists who are more secular humanists whose faith is science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5726)|
| 1:35:35| I have been contacted by pagans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| There's a few of them around and there's a few of them in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| People who practice an ancient Celtic form of Druidism have been contacted by Muslims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5741)|
| 1:35:49| And we have had some wonderful, heartfelt conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| Something that people say is divisive, by the fact that it caused these folks to call me, there was a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5753)|
| 1:36:04| And while we may not see eye to eye on this, I found that we had a good many things in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| And I still support this, even though I have some new friends that may be of a different faith than myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5769)|
| 1:36:17| Freedom of religion does not mean freedom from religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5777)|
| 1:36:23| This merely acknowledges that our founding fathers were men of faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| And that's why I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| It is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| It's not a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| It's not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| We're not requiring anyone to practice their faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| We're simply acknowledging the faith of our forefathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| And that's another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Let's talk about our forefathers for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Our forefathers predominantly were men of faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| They were Christians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| But they were Christians who saw the value in freedom for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| They saw that the one gift that God gave every human being on this planet was liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| And so they wrote throughout our founding documents religious liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| the right to choose whether you worshipped God and how you worshipped God if you chose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5827)|
| 1:37:15| And so in that spirit, I'm not trying to push my faith on anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| I'm simply acknowledging the faith of our forefathers and applauding that they built a country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5841)|
| 1:37:28| where folks like me and Ivan Harmon, with their Christian beliefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| can coexist with my new Muslim, Hindu, atheist, and even pagan friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| And I mean no offense by this to my friends of different creeds and different faiths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| but I support this because I want to acknowledge our founding fathers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| and the faith that they brought to this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| Commissioner Smith, and then we've got some citizens in the audience that'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| I look at this and read it, and I didn't know this was coming up until I got my packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| and I had seen Commissioner Strickland where this has come up before in the North Carolina government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| I've taken a stand before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| There's been cross burnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| I took a stand there in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| This here, it says recognize God as the foundation of our national heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| That's what we learned in school, was that I'm not going to turn my back on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5903)|
| 1:38:31| I'm going to stand up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| Scott, can I speak just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| Are you going to have to ask the comptroller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| Not this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| All right, the motion that's on the floor is a motion to lay on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| Generally speaking, a motion to lay on the table is to interrupt pending business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| so as to permit to doing something immediately, to act immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| If I understand Commissioner Harmon's intent, he is basically moving to kill this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5940)|
| 1:39:11| In so doing, the proper motion would be to postpone indefinitely under Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| I'll accept your Robert's rules clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| I've seen motions to table used to postpone indefinitely, but I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| It's often misused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| I won't split hairs on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Postpone indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| You still want to kill it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Okay, now we've got some citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| And if you'd come to the podium and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Margaret Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| I live at 7103 Rotherwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| It's 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| This resolution, without any question, is divisive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| And it's non-historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| Historically inaccurate, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| And I do agree with the comments that some of the commissioners have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| And obviously I disagree with the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| It's divisive because, as has already been pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| we live in a nation with a very wide variety of religious beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| It's a pluralistic society and always has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| And as someone mentioned, I think Commissioner Lambert has spoken with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| who do not have any belief in a supernatural being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| And, therefore, it's not true, as the resolution appears to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| that citizens should proclaim that it's government's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6032)|
| 1:40:39| to publicly recognize God as the foundation of our national heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| There are a lot of people who do not believe that God is the foundation of our national heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| The first founding document that we need to look at, of course, is the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| And the Constitution of the United States recognizes only one source of the power that government has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| And that source is we, the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| You will not find anywhere in the U.S. Constitution a reference to a higher being or a supernatural power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6066)|
| 1:41:13| Now, it is true that in the Declaration of Independence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| there is a reference to the fact that all men, people, are created equal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6077)|
| 1:41:24| and that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights by their creator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| Yes, that was recognized in the Declaration of Independence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| not originally put there by Thomas Jefferson in his version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| but some of the delegates, the framers, wished to add that reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| That is the Declaration of Independence, which applies to the rights that all of us have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| It says nothing to do with government, because at that point, there was no government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| Government came into being in 1787 when the Constitution was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| Another document that I think Commissioner Lambert and some others might want to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6119)|
| 1:42:07| is a treaty that was passed in 1796, signed by George Washington near the end of his second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6127)|
| 1:42:17| And some of you may have heard of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| It's the Treaty of Tripoli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| There had been a lot of disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| The Barbary pirates were interrupting our trade and kidnapping American sailors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| And the treaty was entered into between the Bey, B-E-Y, the chieftain, and the people of Tripoli,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6150)|
| 1:42:38| now part of Libya, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| And in that document, as I say, signed by the President, approved by Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| no great outcry in the newspapers at the time, contains the wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| as the government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6173)|
| 1:43:01| So we have that document from the era of the founders back in 1796.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6181)|
| 1:43:11| As someone has already pointed out, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| it's not the responsibility of our government to publicly recognize God or to meddle in any way with religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6196)|
| 1:43:26| That's bad for religion. That's bad for government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| You might look at the example of Western Europe, where governments have historically been involved in religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6208)|
| 1:43:35| There's been establishment of religion in Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| And at this point, Western Europe is mostly secular. Not so in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| Thanks to the wisdom of the Founding Fathers, we decreed that there should be no establishment of religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| And we have no problem with religious belief and fervor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| Drive along Kingston Pike, look at the megachurches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Religious belief, belief in God, is pervasive in this society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| We certainly do not need county government to prop up God or religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6247)|
| 1:44:14| They're doing very, very well without Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| In my view, we should let families and churches and synagogues and mosques continue to promote religious faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6259)|
| 1:44:27| in accordance with their traditions. That's their job. It's not government's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| What this resolution does, in my opinion, it comes very close to trying to establish one theistic faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6273)|
| 1:44:42| as the official religion in Knox County. The framers prohibited that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| We cannot establish a religion. And it's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| Ma'am, I hate to interrupt you, but your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| I have one final comment. I will be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| Give her some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| Very briefly, I have a suggestion that there is a resolution that I think would be very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| And perhaps the commission could consider that at some point, which would say essentially that we should urge all citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6306)|
| 1:45:14| to, number one, follow the golden rule. Treat everyone as you would want to be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| Number two, obey the rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| Number three, protect and defend and honor the Constitution of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| and the Constitution of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| That's a resolution, I think, with respect, that we could all get behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| Do we have some? I think we've got a couple of more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| I have to allow the record to check with the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| I said that twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| If you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6350)|

| 1:45:59| This proposed resolution, rather than urging all parents to be actively involved in helping their children form deep spiritual beliefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6359)|
| 1:46:10| independent of government influences, this resolution urges those parents to urge you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6370)|
| 1:46:18| and every other level of government to, quote, quote, publicly recognize God as the foundation of our national heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6378)|
| 1:46:28| How do, if this is passed, how do the various levels of government do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| They put this phrase on a plaque, repeat the words frequently in public, add the phrase to all governmental documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6395)|

| 1:46:48| It soon becomes an empty substitute for deep and meaningful spiritual and religious study and instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6408)|

| 1:47:41| And Commissioner Smith, I'd like to point out to you that I think you got the packet late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6461)|

| 1:47:52| The resolution as written in this agenda says that it's urging American citizens to proclaim to every level of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6472)|
| 1:48:03| government's responsibility, its responsibility to publicly recognize God as the foundation of our national heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6483)|
| 1:48:11| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| God is the foundation of our national heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6492)|

| 1:48:20| I do believe, though, that it's not the responsibility of government to intrude in that proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6500)|
| 1:48:29| That's our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6509)|

| 1:48:32| I would like to see the political realm kept, the politicians kept out of that realm, that religious realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6512)|
| 1:48:42| I want to tell you a quick personal story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| Since we just passed Thanksgiving, my grandparents immigrated to this country for the same reasons that the pilgrims came to this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6525)|
| 1:48:55| They were fleeing religious oppression in oppressive European countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| My mother's parents got to Atlanta in a wave of anti-Semitism just before my mother was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6541)|
| 1:49:11| They fled to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| I've wondered why Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| Why Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| And doing a little research, I found in the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, Section 3 of Article 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6559)|
| 1:49:30| and I want to read the last part of that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| It says that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6573)|
| 1:49:42| and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6582)|
| 1:49:51| And I think this resolution flies in the face of that Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| And I think, you know, obviously one of the commissioners over here mentioned something about your oath of office earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6596)|
| 1:50:05| This is a bad year to be flying in the face of the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| It's just really bad timing, I think, on your all's part to be considering this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6609)|
| 1:50:16| I think there are a lot of things you can do as human beings, as religious people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6616)|
| 1:50:24| to recognize God as the foundation of our national heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| I don't think you need to be involving politics and politicians in that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| And I would ask you to kill it, table it, vote it down, get rid of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| I was with the group three years ago when Mr. Harmon, Ivan Harmon, had a similar resolution up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6641)|
| 1:50:48| It was voted down 15 to 1 or 16 to 1, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| It's a different commission today and a much smaller commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| But listen to the wisdom of those who remember that, and Mr. Strickland in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| And I think you ought to vote with him on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Pardon me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| I believe it also states in the Constitution that a preacher can't run for office in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| And it states, it says this exactly, because his job is more important than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6672)|
| 1:51:19| I'll buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| Let him go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| Sir, if you'll give your name and address of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| My name is Len Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| I reside at 10017 West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| And this is, I've been here more than three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| And this should have been corrected within six months, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| Now, are you going to talk about the solid waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| I'm talking about Knox County solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| Hey, if you'll hang on, we've got to get to that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| We ain't there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Well, we're right now on a resolution for God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| Oh, I thought that had been moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| No, we haven't got there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| I thought the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| Well, I'll say that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| Church and state should be separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| And we'll get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Mr. Chairman, I just want to mention to the group, this is probably going to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| I'm just, to the community, I guess, you know, I wish we had more from the clergy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| We heard from others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| Of course, it's late night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| But I sort of wish we'd heard from the clergy people to what their thought on this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| But we're ready to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| Well, I've got a clarification here, or I want one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| He's got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| What is the underlying motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| So if we don't want to vote for the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| If the motion is defeated to kill it, it goes back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| And Commissioner Hammond, I think, changed it where he said, if you'd say it again, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| instead of saying urging all Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| Instead of saying urging all American citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| it says urging all American citizens who have similar beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| And the current motion on the floor is to postpone indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| So we'll try to do it with a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| All in favor of Commissioner Harmon's motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6782)|

| 1:54:39| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6879)|

| 1:55:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| Move we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Motion made by Commissioner Lambert, seconded by Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| I would like to recommend that you, in the motion, that you include the items that Chris Grange is handing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6939)|
| 1:55:46| These are, this is what we essentially negotiated with the city of Knoxville in order to put the lawsuit to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6946)|
| 1:55:53| Initially, and I apologize, they were in your package originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| but initially they sent out a press release itemizing five items that they wanted to amend in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6956)|
| 1:56:02| and those are reflected in the ordinance you currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| Since that time, they came back with some additional wordage and some verbiage changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| which are reflected in what Chris is handing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| so I would urge you to include that in your amendment to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| Mr. Chairman, a representative from Tennessee Clean Water Network, Courtney Piper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| is here to speak about some of the EPA questions, I believe, and I encourage her to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| We've got a couple of people signed up, so Courtney, if you want to come on down and give us your name and address of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| Courtney Piper, Tennessee Clean Water Network, 123A South Gay Street, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Tennessee Clean Water Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| our goal is to protect Tennesseans' right to clean water, and for the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| we've been providing policy, technical, and community-based expertise to Knox County on our stormwater pollution problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7011)|
| 1:56:59| And I'm here this evening to ask you to vote no on the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| in favor of extending the public comment period in light of the number of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| that have been made to this ordinance over the past couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| and the unanswered questions that still exist around compliance with state and federal clean water laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| Now, stormwater is a huge issue for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| Mud that's found in stormwater at runoff is the state's number one water pollutant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| We have over 350 miles of stream on the state's list of most polluted and impaired waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| And in this time of drought and uncertainty around our water supply, the urgency is real to protect our water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| Now, I read the city's press release where it says that the county has brought their ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| up to the city's 2001 standards on 22 of the 23 points, but we don't know where those agreements were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7061)|
| 1:57:49| Also, like I said, we've got huge problems with water pollution, and that is a local agreement that was taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7069)|
| 1:57:57| There are still unanswered questions around state compliance with state and federal clean water laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| And you can have clean water in a thriving business community only when you have clean water laws that are followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| and you engage the public in the decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| Now, there have been a lot of changes in this ordinance over the past couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| and there is a high level of interest from the public to be engaged in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| So the Tennessee Clean Water Network is asking that you vote no on the current proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| in favor of extending the public comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| We also have Nelson Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| Nelson left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| Nelson left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that this ordinance has been reviewed extensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7120)|
| 1:58:46| not only by an outside consultant but also by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| And the city of Knoxville issued a press release saying that we're in compliance with the 2002 growth plan agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7129)|
| 1:58:56| and that they're prepared to go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| We certainly do not want to postpone this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| You're putting us in a situation that we'll be noncompliant with our NPDES permit by further extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| or postponing this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| This ordinance has gone over an extensive review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| It's been reviewed by the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| and we're prepared to recommend that you adopt this ordinance this evening or pretty soon to be in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7153)|
| 1:59:20| I have a question for you, Mr. Weitrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| Isn't it important to draw a distinction between the urban growth agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| which we appear to have worked out a deal with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| and the broader question of compliance with EPA and state rules about clean water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| Aren't those two separate and really good questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| They are, but I think you will find that we are totally in compliance with what the EPA's Clean Water Act is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| That's the reason this ordinance needs to be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| And this ordinance is framed around our compliance with the NPDES permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| That's why we're urging that this be adopted as opposed to postponing it another two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| which will then put us out of compliance with our NPDES permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| We've been out of compliance for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| I think letting people read through it is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7200)|
| 2:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| This is an ordinance on first reading, which means we'll have to revisit this next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7214)|
| 2:00:21| So it does give the public a chance to comment on it before we do vote on it and make it official next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7221)|
| 2:00:32| But before, and I'm prepared to vote on this on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7232)|
| 2:00:39| but I will not be prepared to vote on it on second reading without the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| and mayor signing a resolution that they have withdrawn their lawsuit against the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7244)|
| 2:00:52| and that they agree that this ordinance meets the as strict as agreement that we have with them in the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7252)|
| 2:01:01| Because, folks, if we don't have that, they're going to hold that over our heads until forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7261)|
| 2:01:10| So it's my opinion that we should not pass this on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| until they take official action, not a press release, official action by city council, signed off by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7275)|
| 2:01:23| that they're accepting this to meet that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7283)|
| 2:01:30| But I am prepared to vote on first reading, and I'll vote on second reading with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7290)|
| 2:01:37| unless there's something else that maybe comes up that needs to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7297)|
| 2:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| Let's go Commissioner Ballard and Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| I'm just wondering, Bruce, if you can post this on some Web site where Courtney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| and her groups and other groups can look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| and then we can have a public forum at our committee meetings if they want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| It's been on our Web site for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| And here again, this ordinance, we've had numerous public meetings on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| The changes that we made in regards to the compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| or trying to get the city to agree on this lawsuit were quite minor in the scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| certainly when it came to water quality and water quantity issues were very minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| It was in some cases they had concerns about redundant language and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| They were minor changes and do not affect the overall enforceability of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7349)|
| 2:02:34| There is one other change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| We received, we did receive one last communication from the city of Knoxville at 3.30 this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| that needs to be incorporated into this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| It is a minor wording change that I believe you can incorporate in the second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| so we'll have it compiled for you for your next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| But it wouldn't be, you would be here for the intergovernmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| in the event that they wanted to ask a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| Okay. Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| This is one of the most heavily debated issues that I've seen before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7383)|
| 2:03:09| not just as long as I've been on here, but for as long as I've been watching commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| This ordinance is the exact same ordinance with only minor changes to avoid a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| that we've already passed on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| So I'm prepared to vote for this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| and I want to applaud our two mayors for getting together and working out this compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| It's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| It's not, my amendments certainly are not as I proposed them, but it's something I can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7414)|
| 2:03:41| So I'm going to vote for this today, and I would urge everyone else to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| Okay. Commissioner Luthold and Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| Or you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| Commissioner Norman had his line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| Okay. Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| I think that this is a tough issue for me for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| Probably I'm, if I'd be known to have any bit of expertise that's helpful to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7443)|
| 2:04:11| it might be on the issue of water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| and certainly Mark Harmon and I are probably the sitting environmentalists, you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7454)|
| 2:04:22| or we lean that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| And so it's difficult for me to, well, what I come to when I talk to our engineers is that this is a document that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7464)|
| 2:04:35| it's a work in progress still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| It's a document that will be reviewed within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| It's got some, we certainly have some severe shortcomings in our county about water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7483)|
| 2:04:49| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| There's a way that Knox City does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| And you want to visit any creek in this city and you'll shortly find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| But don't touch the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| I'm really, I don't think laws clean the water up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| No matter what we do with this ordinance, it's going to be a much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| it's got to be a deeper heartfelt need within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| And that requires a whole lot more than laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| We need to step it up in terms of how we tighten the law or tighten the ordinance probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| and that will be done in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| We need to have more enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| You've got to have a hammer sometimes to get people to do what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7532)|
| 2:05:39| I'm going to go ahead and support this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| But I'm going to support it with the whole idea that I need to intensify my effort as a commissioner in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7541)|
| 2:05:48| and make sure the intent of this ordinance is carried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7548)|
| 2:05:55| That's what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| And so I'm for water quality all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| I'm just going to go about it maybe a little bit different from some of the other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| I'm going to ask, see if we can get it here, having us pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7570)|
| 2:06:15| and having the law director send a letter to the city asking that they pass a resolution stating that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7575)|
| 2:06:25| what I said before about them withdrawing their lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| and that they agree that this ordinance, the way it is written, meets our agreement to be as strict as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7589)|
| 2:06:37| I think we need to have that in writing to protect us from any other possible lawsuits in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7597)|
| 2:06:50| So I didn't know if we needed to put that to a vote or just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7610)|
| 2:06:57| Do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7617)|

| 2:09:26| I live at 10017 West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| And I'm here concerning the Natural Resources Recovery slash Knox County Green Waste Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7769)|
| 2:09:36| And this problem could have been resolved probably two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| if this permit had not been issued to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7780)|
| 2:09:44| If a regular business had been issued this permit, they would have been shut down or the problem would have been eliminated by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7784)|
| 2:09:51| But since it's Knox County, it's still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| We've had difficulties in getting them to do every single thing they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| Initially when you had the odor, you don't have an odor problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| Go to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| Well, it won't go through December 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7806)|
| 2:10:10| November 2005, a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| Everybody agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| We'll solve this in 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| 2006, nothing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| Give up on direct or solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| Give up on the mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| Start with the air quality management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| They come out 16 times to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| And what gets me, they finally, after two years or six months, they hire a professional in odor control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7829)|
| 2:10:37| And here's what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| In a letter dated to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| it's worth noting that the site inspection records of the Knox County Department of Air Quality Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| stand in marked contrast to the complaints received by the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| A November 21st letter, 06, letter written by William O'Shaddon, engineer for the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| to me, Mr. Len Mays, who we understand to be a chief complaint, states in pertinent part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7858)|
| 2:11:08| Now, this is their pertinent part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| The department has conducted 16 inspections of the facility to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| These inspections have involved six different staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| In addition to a staff, a sonometer was used to detect odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7879)|
| 2:11:24| In no time, the department recorded violation of Knox County Air Quality Management regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7884)|
| 2:11:30| Well, after I got this letter, I went up there to review the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| I have 16 letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| Three of the 16 times they come out, three times they detected odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| One was light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| One was medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| One was heavy, sewer-type odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| And every time they come to my house, I've never seen them use a sonometer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| But that's their pertinent part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| What they fail to leave out is, also in this same letter addressed to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7912)|
| 2:11:58| I'm going to paraphrase now since I don't have this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| We have investigated your complaint, and your odor problem mainly is due to sewage delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| and the turning of the turnrobes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| I got an odor problem coming from these, but I don't have an odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| Now, how can that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| That's air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| So what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| I get a petition up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| I take it to Air Quality, sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| This is just saying they detected the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Oh, there's a nuisance clause I found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| So it just detected the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| So I have to go back, start a new survey again, give them the chance to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7951)|
| 2:12:37| Yes, I detected the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| No, I don't detect the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| Check. Yes, it's objectable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| No, it's not objectable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| So this time I take it to the Air Quality Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| They look at, well, we've got to review this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| Sixty days later, come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| What do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| I missed that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7974)|
| 2:12:55| I call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| What was the decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| Well, we decide to delete the second part of that nuisance clause, the one where they do the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7978)|
| 2:13:05| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| This is Knox County regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| Knox County changing the regulations so they don't have to enforce their own regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| I mean, I've had time after time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| Compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| We got compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| They say it's cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| They move it off the pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| Between T-DEC, Knoxville, and Nashville, one says you can't do it, one says you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| One says you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| Now Knoxville says, well, it comes from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| That compost, if you read the regulations, when it's temperature and time, it's only 60% decomposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8013)|
| 2:13:40| when they move that off the pad onto the ground, which is karst, caverns underneath, springs, two wells nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| river on one side, still got 40% or less biosolvent decomposing on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8027)|
| 2:13:56| The only T-DEC regulation states all compost will, leachate from all compost will be collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8036)|
| 2:14:04| It's not being collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| They're moving this stuff off the pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| Nobody knows where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| T-DEC, Nashville, they tell me they have monitoring wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| They don't have no monitoring wells up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| They collect from two ponds, samples from two ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| T-DEC, Knoxville will tell you they don't have more water samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| They may take water samples, but they don't have no wells to check where the water is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| or what's leaching down into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| Same way when they're bringing in bottom ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| T-DEC sends them a letter and says, hey, if you want to take in the bottom ash, you've got to be worried it's got heavy metals in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| I say, T-DEC, I go over, are you guys sampling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| Oh, yeah, we're sampling, we're sampling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| Finally, T-DEC, Knoxville goes over and samples it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| Well, whoa, and behold, they've been selling this compost as Class A to the public for nine months to a year as Class A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8087)|
| 2:14:55| when it exceeded Class A percentages of heavy metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| For nine months or longer, they've sold that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| T-DEC says, well, you guys should have known to test this, the finished product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8105)|
| 2:15:10| Every single product they made exceeded the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8110)|
| 2:15:15| I don't know what else has to be done to get something straightened up over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| They fight you every single one, like the compost now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| Now the compost and odor is still the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| They finally quit taking in the bottom ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| They say, no, we don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| T-DEC says, well, go, we don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| Knox County, we don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| When is the problem going to exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| The problem is going to exist when that biosolids turns to nitrates, goes down in somebody's well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8134)|
| 2:15:41| and then the county is going to have to pay for cleaning it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| Why not get this stuff straightened up before it becomes a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| Okay, Len, right there is the chief of staff of the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| They're over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8152)|

| 2:16:06| Nobody called me for a whole week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| Now you want me to address him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8168)|

| 2:16:52| I'm sure Mr. Lambert does, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| But even after the 90 days, they didn't have the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| because the contractor hadn't collected his data after 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8217)|

| 2:17:35| It smelled like zoo waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8255)|

| 2:17:43| I don't know what it takes to get this county to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| and do what the regulation says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| This is a county permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-3-business?start=8269)|
