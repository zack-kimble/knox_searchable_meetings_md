| 0:17:03| Schools is receiving from the state of Tennessee's ESGR committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| We have 54 committees nationwide, states and territories, and I serve as a state chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| Tommy is the vice chair for the committee for Tennessee, and Steve Martin is my area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| chair here in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| So ESGR's mission is to work with employers to ensure that they understand the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| of the Guard and Reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| As you may know, about 40% of our nation's military capability is in the Guard and Reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| The bulk of those folks work for employers like you, and it's our responsibility to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| educate employers of the rules of the road, the laws, et cetera, that apply if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Guard and Reserve folks that work for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| One of the great things we get to do is recognize fantastic employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| We have awards going from the lowest level to an individual supervisor, to what I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| be discussing in a moment, which is the Secretary of Defense Freedom Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| This is an award by the Secretary of Defense, only 15 are given each year nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1085)|
| 0:18:13| This year there were 1,800 or so nominations nationwide, we had about 50 in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| and each state picks the top large company, the top small company, and the top public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| sector organization in their state, and submit those as their nominees for this prestigious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| This year we are just excited to know that Knox County Schools is in the hunt for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Of those 1,800, Knox County is now in the final 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| Of those 30, 15 will be selected, five of them will be public sector employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| We're crossing our fingers, we're hoping it's coming through, but to get to be a finalist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| out of 1,800 is quite an accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| As my top nominee in the public sector category, I have the privilege of awarding what's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| the Pro Patria Award, the top award that I can give as a state chair to an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| that has done a great job in supporting their Guard and Reserve folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| At this point I'd like to turn it over to Tommy Cawthon, who worked this award, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| with some of your people, and talk a little bit about the award and why your organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| was nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| It was really my pleasure to work on this award package, this award nomination package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| I got to work with some great folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Major Hicks here, he's with the 278th, he's a teacher at Hardin Valley Academy when he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| not doing his military duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Scott Bolton, enjoyed working with him, and Josh Florey, and J.D. came and we gave this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1186)|
| 0:19:56| award, the Pro Patria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| This is kind of the second time we've given this award, but we gave it to him, then he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| had to bring it back so we could give it again in front of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| He came to Nashville to receive that award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| Just appreciate all the great work they did to submit this package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| I think it's really got a great shot at getting one of these 15 Secretary of Defense Employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| Support Freedom Awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| The beauty of these awards is they don't come from the top down, they come from the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| It starts with an employee of Knox County Schools, in this case, nominating their employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| and then it works its way up until, obviously, it's getting the Pro Patria Award tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| but all the way up to the Secretary of Defense is looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| If this award is given to Knox County Schools, we will go to the Pentagon to receive that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Hopefully, the Secretary of Defense will be there to present that, if he's not busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| doing other things at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| One of the first things that stood out, Major Hicks was very excited about putting Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| County Schools in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| He just got an outstanding treatment by Knox County Schools during his military service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| We started off with that, and then the more I dug, it's kind of like chewing a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| of bubble gum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| The more you chew it, the bigger it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Well, that's what I found out with Knox County Schools, just outstanding human resource policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| that support our reserve component members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| I got to see some things like the Medal of Honor Convention that we had here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| Two of the schools in Knox County hosted Medal of Honor recipients there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| The parade that we have every year, four of the high schools participated in that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| marching bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| We had multiple engagements at high school football games where veterans were identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1306)|
| 0:21:56| and were recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Knox County is very proud of their veterans and their reserve component members, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| became very obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| Not only in your policies, the HR policies that go well above what the USERRA law requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| are, but just in practice and practicality and how you recognize your veterans and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1331)|
| 0:22:21| current deserving reserve component members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| That being said, it's been a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| We got our fingers crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| We think Knox County Schools has a great opportunity here, a great chance to win the Employee Support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| Freedom Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Tonight, we want to present the Pro Patria Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Jim, is there anything else you'd like to say before we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| I think you covered it well, so let's bring that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| If we could get those who are going to come down to receive the award, please come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| and we'll get a picture and smile and shake hands and do all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=1372)|

| 0:40:08| As my friend Lance said earlier in the week, you know, he's someone that very much has his finger on the pulse of what's happening with Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2408)|

| 0:40:31| So I just ask that you guys, if you're not able to allow us to sign up here before, if that poses some sort of risk that you come up with a compromise or another way for us to phone in and call, maybe sign up out in the lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2431)|
| 0:40:44| I think we could think outside the box and not further restrict our ability to come and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| I hear all of you at some point saying that you appreciate and value community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2449)|

| 0:40:59| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| I appreciate the reason why we are looking at this, the changes here for safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2464)|
| 0:41:16| But I agree that we need to have as much community input as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2476)|
| 0:41:26| I know there are other ways, but there are some people in the community that do not communicate electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| And also, with the time frame of it coming out, and even with those who may look at the media, still have a struggle to get to sign up prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2493)|
| 0:41:48| When I wasn't sitting on this side, it was more than one time that I signed up on the day of because of the way the information came out and the way that I was able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2508)|
| 0:42:01| And then also, with the meeting being on Monday, if the meeting was on Tuesday, they would have a weekday to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2521)|
| 0:42:11| But you have two days prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| So really, the day that they have to sign up, they have to sign up is on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| So this past time, it came out on Thursday to the public, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| So really, they only had one day to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| And I just don't think that that's fair to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| I do think that the way this building is, it does restrict us when we have a crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| I mean, it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| And I'm a big proponent on decency and order and security and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2558)|
| 0:42:47| But I think there's a way that we can do it that we don't have to restrict that because the public pays the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2567)|
| 0:42:59| The public ought to want to pay the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| So I think it's important for us to do everything we can for them to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| I do appreciate our security chief and his staff for being proactive and thinking about thinking this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| And so I'm not in disagreement with that sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| I just think that we should be able to do both and and not or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2598)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| I completely agree with everything Reverend Butler said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| I appreciate the sentiment behind this policy and the changes and everything our security does to keep the public safe, to keep us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2614)|
| 0:43:44| But I do think that I do value the community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| I do think that we should keep government as open and transparent as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| So I completely agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| I talked about this a little bit last time, so I'll be pretty brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| It was mentioned Monday that the that the agenda comes out on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| But I went back and looked through several of our past emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| And for at least the past six months, it is very consistently come out on Thursdays, sort of mid morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| So in all that time, Thursday, every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| So it's not that extra day that we sometimes think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| And I think leaving it as is, is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| If we would like to have something that feels more secure, I think we need to consider meeting somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2675)|
| 0:44:46| Ms. Spike, did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Sorry, bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Well, I agree with everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| I've heard a lot from the community about access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| And again, the you know, a lot of times people will be at work and cannot check their emails and stuff like that on regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2700)|
| 0:45:08| So they don't see this. And then they have one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| So I think it's a great idea to maybe do something where I also agree with the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| If it's signing up in the lobby, if it's coming out with the agenda, you know, at least a certain amount of days in advance to give people access or some sort of day of sign up that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2720)|
| 0:45:32| I think the community would really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| Thank you, Madam Chair. I also agree with the comments that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| And I am open to discussing other logistical opportunities to prevent or to mitigate the security issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| I think the biggest issue that I've heard is people physically coming into this corral all at one time and talking to the board in order to get their name put onto the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2753)|
| 0:46:04| I mean, I think even some of that could happen logistically where maybe there's a way to do that sign up physically out there, you know, with somebody who then just brings the list up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2764)|
| 0:46:13| Right. I think there's lots of other possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| So I'm open to discussing those in the future, but I would agree that I think we need to be more open and not shut it down any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2776)|
| 0:46:26| I'm not as I don't think it's as big of a concern on the regular voting meeting days because we do have significantly more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2786)|
| 0:46:35| But a lot of people want to vote or not vote, but come and speak on our work session days because we're going to discuss in earnest that whole agenda on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2795)|
| 0:46:44| So oftentimes most of our discussion happens in the work session, which I think is where most people want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| And actually, when I when people ask me when should I come speak, I always tell people to come to the work session because I tell them I like that's the place where I feel like we're going to get the most discussion out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2810)|
| 0:47:00| And so if you want to add your voice, that's where I would add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| So I agree. I don't think we need to change this yet, but I think it'd be worth discussing some logistical opportunities where people don't have to physically come into this corral to do the sign up the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2824)|
| 0:47:20| Thank you, Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| I think that this probably would be one that we would need Miss Coatney's input on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| And I think that maybe it would be wise for us to push this to policy reviews so that we can figure out what might be a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| I think it's important that if our security team is telling us of a concern that we heed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| So I don't want to dismiss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| I think we need to figure out a way that we could perhaps accommodate both both things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| But since a lot of the workload and anything we might discuss goes to Miss Coatney, and she's going to say that we should do whatever we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| But we all know that it will be her having to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| So I want to be cognizant of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| And I feel like we need to to maybe take a step back and think through this a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| So, Mr. Triplett may want to speak, but I would say that we probably need to just make a motion to to push it to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2890)|
| 0:48:19| I'd be comfortable with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| The only thing I thought of was that the key is giving people the weekend to have time to look it over, think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| So I'm wondering, you know, Miss Coatney, again, I know you'll say everything's fine, do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| But what challenges would it be if we just said noon the day of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| You know, you're not you haven't left the building yet to come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| So it wouldn't be an issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| Would that be a simple compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| I would eliminate the the corral issue, but would still give people time to the weekend to look over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| That policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| Well, I would make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| I move that we send it back to policy review and we can discuss those kind of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2937)|
| 0:49:09| So we've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| So so that's got to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| The other thing is what I'm hearing is the issue is the the optional change in line 16, 17, 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2955)|
| 0:49:24| Problem with with pushing it back to policy review for the board is that there's a state law change that goes into effect July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| So, you know, and the rest of the changes to this policy are around that state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| So I'm just going to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2978)|
| 0:49:51| So then can we do a substitute motion to change everything but lines 16, 17 and 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| Would that would that make us compliant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=2998)|
| 0:50:06| Yeah, I make that substitute motion and then push everything else back to policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| Put that put 16, 17 and 18 back on policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| If we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Reverend Butler, I think, made a substitute motion and it was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| So I'm not saying we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| I'm just saying I think there's already a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| Well, if it's offered as a friendly amendment, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| You would offer it as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| No, he would offer it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| I'll offer that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| To your substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| To pushing it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Instead of we'll keep everything but 16, 17 and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| Those lines will go back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| It would be easier to withdraw the substitute and friendly amendment to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| I'm sorry, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Mr. Duport, do we need to withdraw the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| I withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Then I'll make a substitute motion that we approve the policy other than lines, whatever that is, 15, that one paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3062)|
| 0:51:11| 15, 16, 17, 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| And we send that back to policy review for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| So I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| So we have a substitute motion by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| And a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Ms. Swann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| I just have a question for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| Looking at line nine, about public comment at work sessions, called meetings and other special meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| are we required to have public forum at called meetings and special meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| The way I read the new law is that if there's an action to be taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| and certainly that would be the case for special meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| and usually called meetings, special meetings can be the same thing sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| But yes, if there's any action to be taken, any voting, public forum has to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3130)|
| 0:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| So the motion on the floor, the substitute motion by Mr. Triplett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| is to approve all changes to this policy with the exceptions of lines 16 through 18 on page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| And that was seconded by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| And Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| That's nine yes votes and no no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Item 9C, approve first reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy C-123,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| Director of Schools Duties as Amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| I'd like to make a motion to send this back to policy review as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| So we have a motion by Ms. Owen to send back to policy review and a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| So discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| The more I look at this, the more questions I have about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| And I think it's going to take some time to hammer out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| So we've looked at this policy a lot over the past several years, but we've changed very tiny little pieces of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| Nothing really significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| In line 10, it says the superintendent supervises all administrative and supervisory personnel in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3246)|
| 0:54:14| And the change that we're making says that he supervises all personnel in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| And while the superintendent does have authority over all personnel in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| if we change his job duty to say that he is the supervisor of all personnel in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| it seems to me that we are going to have 9,000 people reporting directly to the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3271)|
| 0:54:40| And that could be an issue if he starts getting 9,000 phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| So I think that's something we need to really carefully consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| If we're looking at that chain of authority that we have in other policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| this is going to really work in opposition, I think, to what we would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3295)|
| 0:55:03| So I think we need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| We had talked previously when we were doing superintendent search about what should really be in the qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| and whether the qualifications were really where they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| And these were pulled out as qualifications during a search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| So having the qualifications in with his duties, I think it's going to make it confusing and difficult to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| If we are talking about qualifications of a person that we are about to hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| I think that's not something we want in with the duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| That needs to be somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| The other thing, and I'll ask Mr. Dupler to address this in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| we're changing that to say a master's degree in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| And I believe what we discussed before, and the reason I remember this is because I wanted it to say master's degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| what we were advised previously is that the law says a minimum of a bachelor's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| And so we were trying to make it compliant with what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| And I have some other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| It says that it came from TSBA model policy language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| Did we get this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Did we call TSBA and get an actual copy of their actual model policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| Or did we take this from what we've gleaned online from other districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Yes, we did contact TSBA for a copy of their actual model policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| They were very gracious in sharing that, but did let us know that if we would like any other previews of model policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| we would need to subscribe to their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Right. I think that would be wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| And have I forgotten, have we seen that model policy against this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| Did we have that in policy review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| We did not have it at the time of policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| At that time, I think we were still talking about whether or not we wanted to move the language into this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| So if I recall correctly, you all had versions of the model policy language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| but it was looked at through the lens of maybe five or six other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| I think it would be really wise of us to look at the actual model policy, since we have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| and we're not just guessing at it, and compare that policy language to what we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| and think about all the other policies that are going to be impacted by it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| and look at those before we actually bring this to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| Mr. Dupler, I forgot to ask you to talk about the master's, bachelor's thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| I can, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I mean, simply, as I think you alluded to, TCA simply requires a bachelor's degree for directors of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3468)|
| 0:57:57| a.k.a. superintendents, and that's likely because there's different needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| and different requirements for different districts, different sizes, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| But that remains the minimum requirement is a bachelor's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3488)|
| 0:58:15| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| On line 10, I actually did have a question for maybe Mr. Bolton would be the best to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| And it's really because, to me, it's an HR question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| In line 10, it currently says supervises all administrative and supervisory personnel in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| And if we remove administrative and supervisory, and it just says supervises all personnel in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| from an HR standpoint, what's the definition of supervising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| Because the way I would read it is I would read it the way Ms. Horn does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Like, I don't really believe that the superintendent does supervise all personnel in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| And so if that's what we're saying in policy, to me that would be a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| unless from an HR standpoint he does supervise all employees in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| But I don't know from a technical standpoint how that plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| It's all semantics, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Board Chair, the rest of the board, thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| I really think it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| So when you're looking at the terms of directing the scope of work and duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| there is a bureaucracy that is applied to it, so there is a level of management that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| So he may not supervise directly, but he does have overview and oversight of that supervisory strata.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3568)|
| 0:59:39| So I don't think I would have any preference one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| I mean, there are times when there may be some disciplinary actions and such that the superintendent would sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| that would not be something that would be his direct report, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| So I have no issue with it, really, either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| Ms. Simmelgarn, do you have any issue with it being removed from a technical standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| The superintendent is the ultimate personnel decision maker in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| All right, so, okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| So we have a substitute motion on the floor by Ms. Owen to withdraw this and send it to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3621)|
| 1:00:31| and a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| There was no motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Just a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| Just a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| All right, so, want to do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| So the motion on the floor was to send this policy back to the policy review process, and it was seconded by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3666)|

| 1:01:08| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3676)|

| 1:01:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| That is three yes votes and six no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| All right, so that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| All right, so we have no motion on the floor currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| So now we need a motion to approve board policy C-123, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| So I make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3697)|
| 1:01:47| The public forum speaker was on the administrative and supervisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3707)|
| 1:02:03| Shelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Are you here, Shelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Do you want to go ahead and speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| I know you put 9E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| You know, this one and 9E are pretty similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Do you want to go ahead and speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| I can reach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| They're kind of related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| I'm okay like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| As a fellow short person, yes, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| My name is Shelly Higgins, and I just wanted to thank you all for allowing me to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| you this evening, and I'm really grateful that I was able to be here and sign up this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| evening because I didn't find out about this item until I saw that it was published in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| a news story today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| So thank you all very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| But I did want to talk a minute about some of the proposed changes regarding this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| where the board would be allowing the administration central office to have it over the supervisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3785)|
| 1:03:16| positions and qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| And I totally understand the rationale of why that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| I remember seeing where it was about efficiency and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| But one of the things that I would respectfully ask the board to consider is basically how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| that looks and the accountability to the public in general because one of the vital things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| is that trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| I mean, that's been spoken here this evening even by board members saying that they valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| the community input and trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| And the members who are here, you were elected by the voters and the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3830)|
| 1:03:58| And while it may seem more simple to do things like that, there's kind of a contract that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| if the voters have put their faith to elect you and you are serving, then it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| to have that accountability and that checks and balances in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| And it doesn't matter how well we may like somebody who is in a position in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| It's not a good look to basically hand over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| That's a lot of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| And there's a lot of new faces here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| But for some, you may remember, it's not even been quite 10 years, but we had this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| come up where there were positions filled and things made without knowledge of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| And the board actually kind of had to go back and forgive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| And we would hate to see that happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| That was a period of great distrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| There was not transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| And even if it was not intentional, even now we've had all this reorganizing and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| requires that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| That's even more important to make sure that we have the checks and the balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Because if the board members here, as they've said, that they really do value community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| the voters' input, the taxpayers' input, then even if it's inconvenient at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| that accountability is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| And so I would just ask that you think about that and that you consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| And for those of you who've been here for a while, you think back a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| and some of the issues and problems that caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| So thank you so much for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3947)|
| 1:05:58| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| I just want to apologize to Ms. Higgins because I thought this was the one she was speaking on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| So I may have confused things there, so apologies to Ms. Higgins and the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| that I thought that was the one she wanted to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| So we have a motion to approve the policy as amended by Mr. Triplett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| and a second by Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Ms. Coatney, do you want to do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| Dr. Petlar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| That is six yes votes and three no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Item 9D, approve first reading to rescind Knox County Board of Education Policy C-121,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| Director of Schools, Qualifications, and Selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| It's a motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| I think it might be wise for us to keep this until the other policy has been fully adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| We don't want to get one rescinded before the other one is fully adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4038)|
| 1:07:28| Mr. Dupour, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| Well, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| Ms. Owen, as I understand it, both proposals are on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| So if one is adopted on second reading, then I agree that the other one would need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| simultaneously adopted on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| But I mean, that's kind of where it lies now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| But if that were to get out of order, then Ms. Owen does have a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| But as it is, if they're both on second reading, it would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| That motion was made by Ms. Horne and seconded by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| Do you want to do a roll call on that one as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| Do we need a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Yes, let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4098)|

| 1:08:33| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4116)|

| 1:08:38| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4118)|

| 1:08:40| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| That is six yes votes, two no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Ms. Beig, did you want to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Item 9E, approve first reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy C-132,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| Administrative and Supervisory Position and Qualifications, as amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| with change of descriptor code to G-181.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4143)|
| 1:09:10| Motion by Mr. Triplett, seconded by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| I would like to strongly caution against taking out these items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| and against taking out these three lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| This is a piece of accountability that we really can't afford to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| This is the one place, the one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| when we have oversight of the potential ballooning of central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| We have oversight of ensuring that big government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| doesn't become really big at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| And this is something that's necessary for us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| to be accountable to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| When we put this piece, when we bury this in a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| that's as large as our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| it's very hard to tell how many additional positions we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| especially when we are talking about high-level positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| If we move on down through the G policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| we have very clear definitions of what administrative positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| and supervisory positions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| And those are not just positions that are going to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| spur the moment we need an extra teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| because we have so many more students who have moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| These are not positions that have any reason to be needed suddenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| when there's not time for the board to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| This is the kind of thing that takes planning and foresight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| and this is something that we should have oversight of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| This is something that we have had oversight of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| and it doesn't make sense to me to just give up our oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| It's really the fiscal management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| And if we look back throughout this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| if you look really carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| you may find about $300,000 that you weren't aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| It's too easy for this to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| and have larger and larger and larger administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4279)|
| 1:11:27| It's far too easy when we bury it in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| We are not fiscal experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| We are not budget experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| We are not budget experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| We are not auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| And the idea that we are just going to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| additional positions in that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| when they are not presented to us clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| I think that's just nonsensical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| The public has a right to have us manage their funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| and they have a right to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| if central office is getting larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| They have a right to not have to question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| whether it's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| They have a right to not have to wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| And if it is getting larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| they have a right to blame us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| So it's our responsibility to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| and to vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| and for that blame, if that's what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| to be on us in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| or whatever board it is in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| I don't think they should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| the public should have to question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| whether something is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| It should be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| It should be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| It should be completely open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| And right here in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| if we are adding high-level, high-paid positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| everyone should be completely aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| There's no reason for burying that in a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| Can somebody tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| what administrative and supervisory positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| would be for Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Is it simply limited central office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Or are the definitions broader than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| the administrative and supervisory positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| I don't think would be limited to just central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| There's some system-wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| and then our principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| our school administration would be administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| We do have, like Ms. Owen said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| we do have a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| that defines some of our personnel classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| one of those being supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| So our supervisors could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| and we propose some changes to that definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| at policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| I think it'll be back on next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| But generally supervisors would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| supervisors of people or programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| so curriculum or other type of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| And then administrators could be school administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| and then there's central office administration too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| So that was a longer answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| short answer, no, not just in central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| And I know I brought this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| when we discussed this in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| I have a lot of problem with the word initially there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| because I don't really know what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Is it initially at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| of a school calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| a budget cycle in all of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| I don't know what initially means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| So, and being on the board now almost three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| outside of approving the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| has there been any mechanism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Because I don't remember voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| on specific administrative and supervisory positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Maybe I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| but my memory's not what it used to be either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Outside of voting on a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| what's the mechanism to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| the current mechanism as this policy stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| for us to approve administrative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| new administrative and supervisory positions initially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| Because it's been in policy for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| so it would seem like if it was happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| outside the budget approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| there would have been a mechanism for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| I don't think I'm the keeper of the complete answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| depending on where the position may live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| but there have been some positions approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| as board agenda items outside of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| in the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| The Title IX coordinator would be one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| that I remember most recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| I do remember that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Thank you. Yes, that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| So, on a limited basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| from time to time over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| we've had specific new positions to the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| that would have been brought to the board for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| for the position to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| For the position itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| not the hiring of the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| Title IX coordinator being an example of one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Yes, and I would call that the exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| I think most are as part of a new budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| So, at the same time that we've had a few come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| there's been others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| new positions that have been creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| administrative or supervisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| that we did not vote on over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| The reason I'm asking these questions is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| we have a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| that I don't really know how it's supposed to be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| And it seems like maybe it's up for interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| And to me, that's what we don't want in our policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| is we don't want it to be up for interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| I don't want it to be up for interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| I would assume the administration doesn't want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| to be up for interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| So, that's why I'm trying to get clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| I'm not asking these questions to express fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| in anything that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| I'm trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| how have we been doing this up until this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| It's different depending on the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| I mean, I can't speak to historics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| outside of my last year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| But I would say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| like in this budget cycle we just went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| in the one-on-one conversations we had with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| and then even in the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| we laid out, Joe and Joni and Ron| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| did a good job of laying out positional changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| They even showed unbudgeted positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| such as like the ELL and the SPED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| that were required by law to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| So, if you remember that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| those were the ones that were added last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| based on those reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| and then any other new positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| were posted in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| So, that's how we did it this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| But most of those were more of the same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| They weren't actually brand new positions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Because this policy doesn't speak to more of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| It speaks to brand new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Yeah, and I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| Some could be new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| Like an example of that would be this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| for the family students, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| But the majority of the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| that you brought up in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| when we met with the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| were more of existing positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| We're just getting more of them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| If we remove the red line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| the way I read the former policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| is that line six where it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| in each case that the function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| of us approving those administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| and supervisory positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| the way we do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| is through the approval of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| or through the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| Or is that completely new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| That's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| So right now, the current policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| again, if you remove the red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| it actually doesn't say how we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| There is no mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| for the approval defined in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| It's constrained by the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| Yeah, it says it's constrained by the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| but to me, all that's saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| we can't approve things that we can't fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| but it doesn't talk about a specific mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| to make the actual approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| We don't have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| for anything else we do either, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Well, I guess, Ms. Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| what I'm trying to get clarity on is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| and I understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| I completely understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| But I'm asking if we leave this as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| we leave those three lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| what are you suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| would be the mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| outside of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| What I hear you saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| you don't think approving it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| within the budget is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| And so I'm trying to imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| like I don't think any of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| every month want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| not that we need to add supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| and administrative positions every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| but I just don't think that is our role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| to formally vote on each individual one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| So I'm trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| what would be the mechanism outside the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| because it's not clearly defined in current policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Okay, it would be the same mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| as we have for approving everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| It would be through a vote of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| And I want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| I want to word this very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| to be very clear that what I'm about to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| is no fault of anyone sitting in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| When,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| at the beginning of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| we were looking at some job duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| some job descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| If we look at the job descriptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| we are also supposed to be approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| the job descriptions for these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| And when I was looking at job descriptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| I believe what was found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| was that the job descriptions were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| they had not been updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| they were not consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| Many of them had not been created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| as far as I understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| and that is no one in this room's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| It's just over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| that's a big old ball that had been dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| it's something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| if we're not looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| because obviously we haven't been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| then that just goes further and further along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| not keeping with what is actually state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| is that we are supposed to have on file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| current and accurate job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| for every position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| And I would also say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| a new position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| is a new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| If there are already five of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| if you create another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| that's another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| it's a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| So it's not creating titles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| it's creating a position that is funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| It's not people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| it's a position that is funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| and it's initially created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| when it is first created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| So if you have four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| and you want to create a new one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| when you create it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| it's been initially created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| it is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| It's just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| So when that is created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| if you have five positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| that are similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| and you have another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| you could give that the same job description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| or you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| this one is very similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| but it needs a different job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| And that's when that approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| would all come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| just like a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| just like an MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| just like building a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| All of those pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| would come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| and when we have a lengthy list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| of here's how it happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| it happens by being put on an agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| If someone wants to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| it comes on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| and we say, sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| we like that idea, do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| That would be how it would be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| the same way as everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| It would be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| through a vote of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| transparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| so the public knows we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| I don't know if I asked her a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| it's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| It was a long answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| but it's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| I appreciate the additional clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| on where your concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| and where you think the opportunities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| When you started your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| by saying you don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| we should remove lines two through four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| I actually think if you just leave those in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| I don't think it actually addresses your concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| because later in the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| when it adds the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| that the mechanism is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| to formula set off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| I mean maybe it's just me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| but I'm having a lot of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| with the semantics of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| because in good faith I can read this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| about three different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| I mean I can interpret this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| in a number of different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| and I can make a good justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| for why I'm doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| I would make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| that we take this back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| because I do think it needs new work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| and I'm happy to go to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=5015)|

| 1:48:17| So that fails, so we are back to our original motion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| Which was made, I believe, by Mr. Triplett and seconded by Ms. Horne, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6501)|
| 1:48:32| Any discussion on that, Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6512)|

| 1:48:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6516)|

| 1:48:45| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| That's what we had agreed on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| And I'll second that since I seconded the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| So approve it based on, along with the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| So we are amending it to, for the title to be labeled Ms. Flautner, job descriptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6535)|
| 1:49:07| okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| And you accept that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6548)|

| 1:49:18| Okay, so do I correctly understand that we're voting on a policy that's on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6558)|
| 1:49:26| that's not correctly redlined, so the public can't see what we actually are trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6566)|
| 1:49:42| I believe we are changing the title, right, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| So are you saying that this should have come to us redlined with job descriptions there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6586)|
| 1:49:54| instead, or, I'm very confused, and I assume the public is too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6594)|
| 1:50:07| So the amended motion is to change the title, keep everything else the same, is this correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| Mr. Triplett, Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6613)|

| 1:50:24| be moved to the G, which is already redlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6624)|
| 1:50:31| Is that correct, just to be clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| All right, so that is the amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6635)|

| 1:53:51| My name is Michael Shope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| I'm a Knox County resident, Knoxville native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| I've had the pleasure the last few years of serving on a board for an entity in Campbell County that offers a release time education course according to the policy passed by that LEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6836)|
| 1:54:09| and this would create a similar policy for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6849)|

| 1:54:23| I don't think I'll take three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| Release time education is a constitutional right, and that's been confirmed by the Supreme Court in a case in 1952.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6866)|
| 1:54:38| What this policy would do in accordance with a recently amended Tennessee state law is offer one elective credit for such a course so long as it meets certain requirements of that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6878)|
| 1:54:55| There are some benefits that I'd like to point out, and I think for the most part the policy speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6895)|
| 1:55:03| But what we've seen in Campbell County and what we hope to see in Knox County are the results that we've seen in the students that have taken these classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6903)|
| 1:55:14| They have better academic performance on average after they've taken these classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6914)|
| 1:55:21| They're receiving moral instruction during the school day, and we have a tendency to focus solely on our mind and our body in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6921)|
| 1:55:33| and that's the place of the school system, but it tends to cause us to ignore the spiritual needs of students who spend the majority of their waking hours in a school building outside the supervision of their parents and under the supervision of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6933)|
| 1:55:49| A policy like this would allow parents to direct the education of their kids in a way that part of their daily life revolves around their spiritual health and their spiritual development and their moral development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6949)|
| 1:56:04| There's also resources saved by the school when programs like this are in place because private funding provides for these programs, and so that cuts down on class sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6964)|
| 1:56:20| and so education is being provided by private entities at no cost to the state or the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6980)|
| 1:56:31| I really wish I could answer questions, but I understand that that's not how this works, so I apologize for not understanding the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| I'm not sure what else I'd like to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| Again, I think the policy speaks for itself, but the amendment that passed in the General Assembly this session increased the credit to be offered from half a credit to a full credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7004)|
| 1:57:00| and I want to be clear that these courses are legal to be offered at no credit at any time, and I think there are examples of that across the state, particularly at the elementary level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7020)|
| 1:57:16| I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Well, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| I did not hear that pretty noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| Madam Chair, if I may, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| Now, you all can go ahead and discuss, Jay, if the board would like, because there was a public speaker, but I would ask that the board go back to H&I at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7053)|
| 1:57:52| I'll go ahead and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| Due to the change in state law, we would ask that the board approve that on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| Let's give a second reading, because that goes into effect July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| I, just a clarification, that is not required by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7086)|
| 1:58:13| I mean, if this board wants to do that, that's a great gesture, but I is not required by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7093)|
| 1:58:20| But, likewise, if you want to provide I, we would ask that both H&I be approved on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7100)|
| 1:58:30| So we will continue with this motion on the floor, and then we'll revisit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| Does that sound okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| Ms. Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| Sorry, my brain went to that one for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| Now I'm going to try to get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| Okay, yes, I'm sort of on Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| I don't have an objection to Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| I know we've had in the past quite a lot of discussion, quite a lot of discussion about release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7137)|
| 1:59:08| Wait, we're on Jay or we're on I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| I, course credit earned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| It's Jay on my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| I suddenly can't read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| Okay, I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| Okay, so we've had a lot of discussion about this in the past, and I was opposed to that policy in the past because it was for very small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7166)|
| 1:59:35| I want the board to understand that I'm not objecting to this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| However, I don't think this policy is ready because there's some pretty major pieces of it that I think we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7180)|
| 1:59:50| I looked for Campbell County's version, and I didn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7190)|
| 1:59:57| Actually, as I was looking for it, I got confused and started thinking I was in the wrong county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| so I looked for some other counties, too, who are doing some version of release time, and they did have a version but not a credit version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7202)|
| 2:00:10| And so I would really like to look at another county's version that has the credit in there so we can see how they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7210)|
| 2:00:18| The piece that most concerns me, though, is the piece that says the board shall approve the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7218)|
| 2:00:26| and here it doesn't say that the board will approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| It's for a credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| So if we are looking at approving for a credit, I would think we would want to approve that in advance so that a student doesn't go through a course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7233)|
| 2:00:46| and then end up maybe not getting a credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| But in the policy, it doesn't say that the board will approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| It says that it will be the curriculum supervisor's approval, and I don't think that aligns with what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7254)|
| 2:01:06| Mr. Dupler, can you help us with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7266)|
| 2:01:16| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| I'll say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| I mean, one, the board can certainly delegate to other individuals within the system as far as approving the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7280)|
| 2:01:31| The language in the proposed policy does come, for the vast majority of it, out of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7291)|
| 2:01:40| But I will also say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| Dr. Wilson and I spoke briefly before the meeting, and he feels like that likely there could be a couple tweaks done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7303)|
| 2:01:53| But this was placed on the agenda to get this opportunity out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7313)|
| 2:02:02| so that's certainly something that we could take a look at before second reading is to fine-tune it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7322)|
| 2:02:12| So, Mr. Dupler, if the law says that the board shall, we could still delegate that away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7332)|
| 2:02:24| I'd have to look at the law again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| Which line are you on, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| It's not necessarily a line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| I'm thinking about in the law where it says that the board shall approve the course before credit can be awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7354)|
| 2:02:44| And so that's my concern, is that it very specifically says the board shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| And we are saying that the curriculum supervisors will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| And I don't understand if we have the legal authority to give it away when the law says that we shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7373)|
| 2:03:01| If I may, when we've discussed this, basically the way that we approve new courses is through a course code when the board approves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7381)|
| 2:03:11| So it would have to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| So before there would be anything in a school, this board would have to approve an MOU with the entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| There would be a course code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Like, this is just one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| There would be multiple steps before any course would be offered in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| So all this policy is saying is that this board would accept the credit that a student would earn if a course were offered, which, as has been stated, is part of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7408)|
| 2:03:44| So this would just allow parents to access that credit for students if there were something that was offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7424)|
| 2:03:53| And maybe Dr. Wilson could speak to the process that there would have to be a course code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| There would have to be an MOU with an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| So we would certainly have other steps before anything would be offered in a school because you'd have to have a course code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7442)|
| 2:04:09| And I understand all those additional steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| My concern is that the piece of the law that says that the board shall is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7451)|
| 2:04:18| And so if we miss something that we're required to do and then a student gets through this course and they don't get credit because we messed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7458)|
| 2:04:26| I want to be sure that it's correct here that if it's our legal requirement for the board to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7466)|
| 2:04:35| that we have that language and that we do approve it so that it's not approved by someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7475)|
| 2:04:43| and then a student ends up taking the course and not getting credit because we don't word it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7483)|
| 2:04:50| I mean, I would think if we went through the process correctly that that wouldn't, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7490)|
| 2:04:58| Dr. Wilson, do you have anything you would like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| Probably not anything that makes it clearer, but I'll be happy to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| So, and I'll say, Ms. Owen, I'm looking at the paper you shared with me the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| And looking further at this, and that's kind of why I talked to Gary about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| When it talks about the board's responsibility that the board shall review for this course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| it's really outlining that around the ascribing the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| If you look at the offering of the course, any kid can participate without that oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| But when we get to offering the credits, there is that call for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| And what it really says is essentially that that review does not involve any test for religious content or denominational affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7530)|
| 2:05:38| The secular criteria used would be, one, to look at that amount of classroom instruction time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| to look at the course syllabus, which reflects the course requirements and the materials used in the course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| which is probably the closest to curriculum that I would say we get to reviewing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| and that the methods of assessment that are used in the course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| that it would, whether or not the course was taught by an instructor licensed pursuant to Chapter 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| which, again, if we're not giving credit, it appears the law does not require that license for that instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| So, again, when we talk about that test, I think the test for the, if it were the board or if it were supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7566)|
| 2:06:13| would, you know, this is an external entity offering a course to Knox County students at no cost to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7573)|
| 2:06:21| And I would liken it, we don't really have other things that I could draw a parallel to other than, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| like a dual enrollment course that is offered through an MOU on a post-secondary campus by a post-secondary instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7586)|
| 2:06:33| And in those cases, again, we have MOUs that outline the courses we offer and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7593)|
| 2:06:40| But, you know, again, that's a internal process where we look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| I can't speak legalities to whether or not our supervisors are authorized to assess that on behalf of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7605)|
| 2:06:52| And so your question, I really can't answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| But I think our review of it would be pretty specific to those time constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| to ensuring there's no controversial material in terms of like that would break the law that we would be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| And then that we had licensed instructors and course codes and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| So that's what I would think our test would be for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| And I would understand all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| And in my mind, all of that belongs in the procedure that goes with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7636)|
| 2:07:23| And Ms. Horne, to answer your question, really, technically, it's line 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7643)|
| 2:07:29| And so all of this other language is on that piece of paper that Dr. Wilson has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7649)|
| 2:07:36| And that's straight from TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| The only words that are different, if I'm recalling correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| curriculum supervisors is what's there instead of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| So the curriculum supervisors part, I would expect to find in the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| I would expect us to be in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| Because the curriculum supervisors would be doing all of that part before it ever came to us for our approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7679)|
| 2:08:06| And since the law says that we have to approve and all this language is under what we have to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7686)|
| 2:08:15| I would expect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7695)|
| 2:08:16| I would expect us to be here in this policy and the curriculum supervisors to do the prior piece, which would be in procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7696)|
| 2:08:25| Does that make sense, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| And again, I do believe this policy will need to be tweaked slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| I think the essence is there, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| But I think what was trying to be conveyed there is the curriculum supervisor is going to take a look at this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7718)|
| 2:08:48| Someone with administration is going to take a look at this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| But ultimately, and I think this is what Ms. Horn is saying too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| is that the board will ultimately have to approve the actual course through an MOU and probably course code and whatever else is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7736)|
| 2:09:07| But I think everybody is saying the same thing, which is yes, the board will have to approve the actual course at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7747)|
| 2:09:14| I don't mind having curriculum supervisors in here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| But I could vote for it if it said that we were approving, which would match the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7759)|
| 2:09:27| And if we need another step that says curriculum supervisors would do it first, I don't feel like that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7767)|
| 2:09:35| But I feel like the necessary part is the part that's actually in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| And obviously I'm not a lawyer either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| But I would feel comfortable voting for it if it matched what that one line says from that piece of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7782)|
| 2:09:55| Because the rest of this does match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| Can I ask a question, Ms. Horn, since you brought this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| I'm assuming, and maybe I shouldn't do that, that part of the need to bring this now would be if an organization is interested in pursuing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7803)|
| 2:10:14| they obviously don't want to pursue it unless they know that we're willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7814)|
| 2:10:21| Yeah, so the organization could form and actually bring us an MOU without students getting credit for the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7821)|
| 2:10:31| because they have that right under the state law and as the religious release time law allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7831)|
| 2:10:38| However, since the legislature increased this from a half credit to a full credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| this entity would like to offer it to students for credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| But it is important for them to be able to know what they're actually dealing with at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| So to me, this is a first step because there will be several other steps of approval process as the process goes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7852)|
| 2:11:00| But the entity would like to be able to know whether this board is going to allow for this credit to be accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7860)|
| 2:11:12| And like I said, that's going to take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| If we need to tweak something before we even get to second reading, I think back to Ms. Owen's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7875)|
| 2:11:22| I think that the verbiage here would need to match whatever is appropriate with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7882)|
| 2:11:30| but also what we do with other courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| I don't think that this board is going to review the curriculum for this any more than we would for any other course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7893)|
| 2:11:41| which I don't think that we're in the habit of specifically reviewing curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| We typically have our curriculum supervisors who do that work and bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| So I feel like that we would, through the approval process with the MOU, with the course code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7912)|
| 2:11:57| I feel like we would be completing all those steps to satisfy the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7917)|
| 2:12:03| If Mr. Dupler feels like the verbiage needs to be tweaked somewhat, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| But I think that, as he said, in the spirit of the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| is a first step toward an entity being able to utilize that release time and students receiving credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7932)|
| 2:12:19| So in looking at line 35 or 34 and 35, Ms. Owen, is that something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7939)|
| 2:12:29| are you saying if we put in that language there the Board of Education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| Could Dr. Wilson read that line for us since the paper is still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| The one about shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| Okay, I may read too much. I'm going to start where I think we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| So the local Board of Education may adopt a policy to award students credit for work completed in a release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7970)|
| 2:12:57| Fast forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| If the Board adopts the policy in accordance with this subsection, then a student may be awarded a credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| Now, a unit of elective credit for the completion of each release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| In order to determine whether elective credit may be awarded for the student's completion of a release time course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| the local Board of Education shall evaluate the course in a neutral manner that does not involve any test for religious content or denominational affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=7993)|
| 2:13:21| For the purposes of this subsection G, the secular criteria used to evaluate a release time course may include those factors that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8001)|
| 2:13:29| Okay, so Madam Chair, to answer your question, I would take line 35 and instead of saying Knox County Schools Curriculum Supervisors are to evaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8009)|
| 2:13:40| I would change it to the Knox County Board of Education shall evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| And that way I think it matches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| I mean, that's fine with me if that is satisfying to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| I think in the spirit of this, I think that Knox County Board of Education employs all the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8036)|
| 2:14:03| So to me, it's saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| But if the Board feels better about it matching the law specifically, I mean, obviously the curriculum supervisors are designees of this Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8045)|
| 2:14:13| So to me, it's the same difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| I would hate for us to grant credit and then somewhere along the line someone sue and those credits somehow be taken away by a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8057)|
| 2:14:27| because we didn't do exactly what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| So I think just making sure that we do it correctly and that we follow what's there is all I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8070)|
| 2:14:37| So would that be a friendly amendment you were making to the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8077)|
| 2:14:48| Yeah, Madam Chair, since we're going to tweak it on the fly, I mean, you know, if we're going to use Ms. Owen's language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8088)|
| 2:14:55| my suggestion would be you also need to add some language in that same section stating that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8095)|
| 2:15:03| to the effect that the Board is evaluating this course just like any other secular course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8103)|
| 2:15:10| I mean, you know, because that's Ms. Horne's concern, which is and sounds like we're all concerned about getting sued, rightly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8110)|
| 2:15:18| But Ms. Horne's point is we don't want to be discriminatory either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8118)|
| 2:15:25| Yes, I think to that point, I would prefer that we say that it is that Knox County Schools, if you want to say Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8125)|
| 2:15:40| will review this course as any other course offered, and then to, comma, evaluate the course neutrally, blah, blah, blah, as it is stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8140)|
| 2:15:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| Madam Chair, so I'm very visual, and maybe I heard it incorrectly, but Dr. Wilson, on what you wrote with the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| did it say the Board of Education shall evaluate, or did it say shall approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8166)|
| 2:16:13| Local Board of Education shall evaluate the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| I wish it said approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8182)|
| 2:16:29| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| If I may, everybody needs to understand that the curriculum will be evaluated by the staff to make sure that the time is met, that there are tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8190)|
| 2:16:44| that it is a course as they would have at school, that it is a valid school course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8204)|
| 2:16:51| However, the content will be based on the class that is offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8211)|
| 2:17:00| So the school system, that's the whole purpose of it being offered off campus and being paid for without taxpayer funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8220)|
| 2:17:07| The content is not under the purview of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| Sorry, Ms. Horne, I wasn't actually done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| I only have one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| And I don't know if this satisfies Ms. Owen's concerns, but my suggestion would be on line 35 to say that the Knox County Board shall approve the curriculum based on the Knox County Schools Curriculum Supervisor's evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8240)|
| 2:17:34| Because to me, the function of the evaluating is the supervisor, and we're ultimately approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8254)|
| 2:17:40| So to me, it would be the board is approving based on their evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| That's the way I would change it, because I actually don't think technically we're going to be doing the evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8263)|
| 2:17:49| I mean, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8269)|
| 2:17:52| I'd love to agree with that, but our legislators wrote some language that amazingly doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8272)|
| 2:18:07| The reason we can't approve this as we would any other curriculum is because the rest of our curriculum is approved at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8287)|
| 2:18:16| And if we look at some of the policies that we looked at last time that aren't on this agenda, several of them said very clearly we only use curriculum approved by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8296)|
| 2:18:28| Well, this is something that is not curriculum that's approved at the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| It's approved only locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| It can't go through any other process because there's not a process where we approve other curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8317)|
| 2:18:45| We don't evaluate curriculum that the state gives us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8325)|
| 2:18:52| Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| And then our supervisors choose which one to use, and we don't really deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| That's all administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| But the legislature has created language that, as Mr. Watson pointed out, we would love for it to say approved, but it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8342)|
| 2:19:14| It says that the board shall evaluate, and that's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| And it's not asking us to evaluate the content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| It's asking us to evaluate the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| And everything is very clear there, but it is asking that the board evaluates and not the curriculum supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8365)|
| 2:19:33| So, I mean, if we want to add something about a process shall be determined by the curriculum supervisors, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8373)|
| 2:19:47| I mean, that would be procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| I don't think we even need that, though, because the superintendent has the authority to delegate to staff or to promulgate rules himself for all the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8390)|
| 2:20:04| I mean, he has that administrative authority to create procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8404)|
| 2:20:11| So as long as we have the policy that says that the board is going to evaluate, then the procedure can take anything else and have the curriculum supervisors do all those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8411)|
| 2:20:28| So that would, I mean, that's, I think that's all there, and I don't think it needs to necessarily be stated here, but it could be if that would help things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8428)|
| 2:20:42| The only thing, I mean, I'm not objecting to this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| I'm only trying to make sure that we follow what it says so that a student doesn't somehow lose a credit for us messing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8447)|
| 2:20:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| I'm fine with the way it's stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| As I said before, I think that it's implied that that those folks work for the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| Mr. Dupler, if you disagree, then I think maybe we should change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8467)|
| 2:21:13| Otherwise, I'm fine with voting on it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| Thank you, Ms. Horne, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| I'll go back to what I originally stated, which is if the board wants to go ahead and pass this on first reading due to the time constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8478)|
| 2:21:28| you know, Dr. Wilson and I can take another look at it and take into account what Ms. Owen has stated tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8488)|
| 2:21:39| and bring back a revised version for second reading that hopefully would fully cover and make the state law as clear as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8499)|
| 2:21:52| to Ms. Owen's point, which is not always real clear, but do our best to try and make it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| All right, so we have a motion by Ms. Horne and a second by Ms. Henderson, right, to approve this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8520)|
| 2:22:11| Do we need a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8539)|
| 2:22:24| So the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8544)|
| 2:22:38| Yes, we will go back to the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| So going back to ‑‑ oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8560)|
| 2:22:52| Okay, so we have a motion to go back and approve H&I on first reading by Mr. Triplett and a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8579)|
| 2:23:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8580)|
| 2:23:01| And I don't care that we're doing that, but are we able to go back, rules of order, if we've already approved something in the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8581)|
| 2:23:09| I didn't think we could go back and revote on an issue that's been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| I think if you're on the winning side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| And I'm definitely not a Roberts rule expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| I'm just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| Well, so I mean, you know, the answer to that is the same motion is not coming back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8601)|
| 2:23:28| I mean, you know, this is a new motion to enhance basically what already has been voted and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8608)|
| 2:23:37| So it's not revoting on the same motion with the intent of perhaps defeating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8617)|
| 2:23:44| It's to add to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| Mr. Duper, it may have changed, but I believe the law used to say that as long as it was in the same meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8634)|
| 2:24:07| and you were on the prevailing side that you could revisit something if you wished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8647)|
| 2:24:16| Is that still true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| Yes, you're correct, Mr. McMillan, but I don't even think that that would apply in this particular situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8658)|
| 2:24:24| due to the fact that you're not revoting on that exact same motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8667)|
| 2:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| So, Mr. Duper, I believe you said that I misspoke when I said that the parental leave in the second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8675)|
| 2:24:45| for classified employees was also in the law, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8685)|
| 2:24:50| So it's just teacher, just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| The new law only applies to certified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| To certified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| While we're looking at approving these on first reading, has the staff looked at potential costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8696)|
| 2:25:16| Ms. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| So the cost would be the substitute for the employee that's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| So there's not, the additional cost for the employee that is taking the leave would be potentially additional sick days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8725)|
| 2:25:33| or personal vacation days in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| They would just continue their regular salary for the six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| The cost would be for the substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| So for classified specifically, last year we had roughly 24 classified employees over the course of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8743)|
| 2:25:52| that would have qualified for the paid parental leave and also been eligible for a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8752)|
| 2:25:59| So maybe slightly more than that would have qualified for the leave but not for a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| Depending on the nature of the classified position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| so most of our classified employees that would receive a substitute would be school secretaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8769)|
| 2:26:15| educational assistants or educational assistants in our satellite classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| And for six weeks that would be roughly 30 business days and an average of $100 to $115 a day for those substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8780)|
| 2:26:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8793)|
| 2:26:40| All right, so we have the motion to approve H&I on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8800)|
| 2:26:52| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| So motion by Mr. Triplett and a second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| 9K, approve first reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy I-123, academic acceleration as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8830)|
| 2:27:19| Motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| 9L, approve first reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy I-340, promotion, retention, acceleration as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8850)|
| 2:27:39| Motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8863)|
| 2:27:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| I need to look and make sure this is the one I'm thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| This is third grade retention, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| I think some of the things that are happening at the state level have changed since this policy was drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8875)|
| 2:28:02| Do we need to go back and look at that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8882)|
| 2:28:08| What I'm thinking is under the notifications, I'm not seeing anything about appeal processes and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8888)|
| 2:28:30| We'd be happy to go back and make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| I know some of those things have been updated in the last several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| We'd be happy to go back and look at that in advance of the next meeting if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| Do we need to keep this here for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| Do we need it in place quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| I'd ask Dr. Phillips as far as the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| The changes that are in here are time sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8931)|
| 2:28:59| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8939)|
| 2:29:04| I believe that these updates are really, some of them are time sensitive in accordance with what's currently happening that our students are facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8944)|
| 2:29:14| I can easily go back and make those modifications around the appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| I also updated the procedure associated with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8959)|
| 2:29:26| What I can do is couple the policy with procedure so that you can also see what's outlined in procedure as well as what's in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8966)|
| 2:29:36| Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| I would want to be sure that we don't get so specific that when it wiggles again next year that we have to do it all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8978)|
| 2:29:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| That is why I made some changes to the procedure and not necessarily in the policy because we do anticipate that there may be some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8987)|
| 2:29:56| And then with the amended portion of the law taking effect July 1, I also planned ahead for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=8996)|
| 2:30:05| And so the procedure outlines much more detail than the policy does just for that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9005)|
| 2:30:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9012)|
| 2:30:13| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| So Dr. Phillips or Dr. Wilson, so this is when we need to approve on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9014)|
| 2:30:22| I would recommend approval on first read, but knowing that we could make some modifications per the appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9022)|
| 2:30:33| I wonder if we should hold it and approve it on first reading in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9033)|
| 2:30:39| I think as long as we approve before July 14, which it's close, but I would want it approved before final retention notices have to go out on July 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9039)|
| 2:30:58| Got it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9060)|
| 2:31:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9070)|
| 2:31:11| Do we have a motion on the floor already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9071)|
| 2:31:19| Ms. Watson made a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| I'd like to offer a friendly amendment to approve on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9081)|
| 2:31:25| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9086)|
| 2:31:27| So we have a friendly amendment to approve this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9087)|
| 2:31:32| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9098)|
| 2:31:39| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9099)|
| 2:31:44| 9M, approve first reading of new Knox County Board of Education Policy J359, Private Practitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9104)|
| 2:31:51| Madam Chair, can we take a recess before a motion becomes on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9111)|
| 2:31:54| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9114)|
| 2:31:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9115)|
| 2:31:56| So we'll do a quick ten minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=9116)|
