| 0:05:42| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| We hear it first, so they don't have to sit through all these presentations and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=343)|

| 0:06:20| At the request of Commissioner Daly, we will go ahead and address Item 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| Let me just have this for discussion only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| Item 14 is Resolution R-24-3-206.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| It's a move and amendment to order roofing contractors incorporated for roof replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=395)|
| 0:06:42| at Fairview High School at a cost of $2,629,112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| I have this pulled off the agenda just because, well, a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| One, it's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| But two, a lot of times I think the public doesn't realize that the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=418)|
| 0:07:05| and the school system is doing maintenance to our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| And I think this is a great example where the high school was built in the mid-'70s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| and now they're getting an almost $3 million roof replacement, which is badly needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| So I just wanted to thank our representatives from Knox County Schools for continuing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| do an outstanding job and to also just let the public know that, hey, they are taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| care of the facilities that are entrusted to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=456)|

| 0:07:42| Seeing none, we'll move on to honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| And by Commissioner Jaddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=468)|
| 0:07:58| I don't have the resolution number, but it is a resolution honoring the members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| Class of 2024 Junior Commission Civics Education Program upon their program completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=483)|
| 0:08:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| We will present that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=494)|

| 0:09:11| of being an age-friendly community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=551)|

| 0:09:44| Michelle Moyers, Deputy Senior Director, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| So, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| I'm very pleased to share some information about a special designation that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| is pursuing, and this is done in partnership with our local AARP office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| And I have a very brief presentation that provides some background information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| this effort and our current status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| So, I think everyone's very familiar with AARP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Go back one slide, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| So, I think everyone's very familiar with AARP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| I think what folks don't know about AARP is that they're more than just a senior discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| They're the largest nonpartisan nonprofit that is dedicated to empowering Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| age 55 and older to live their best lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| And they have a breadth of programs that are housed under AARP, and most of those programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| are really dedicated to improving the quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| And one program they have is called Age-Friendly Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| And I'm here today to talk about Knox County's work in that program area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| So, the Age-Friendly Network has been around for about a decade, and its primary focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| is really to support local, state, and regional governments as they prepare for our aging population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| So, the big question is, why would we join the Age-Friendly Network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| And according to the U.S. Census Bureau, by 2034, so just 10 years from now, the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| will have more people age 65 or older than under the age of 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| And we certainly see the statistic mirrored in Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Our demographics are saying that age 55 and older is our fastest-growing group in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=690)|
| 0:11:39| So, while our changing demographics are in alignment with national trends, how we respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| and prepare could make our community stand out to current and future residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| So, Knox County officials were approached in 2022 by three local AARP volunteers about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| pursuing this age-friendly designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Two of these volunteers were actively involved in the Advance Knox effort, and one also serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| on the local county health council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| And all three AARP volunteers felt that Knox County was already doing the work that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| needed to become recognized as being age-friendly, and we just needed to put some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| focus into receiving that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| So, I'm here as the leader of this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Knox County Health Department was asked to take the lead in organizing the effort to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| pursue this designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| And so, the first step was to assemble a team, and the Knox County internal team has six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Mandy Benedict with Knox County Constituent Services, Carly Pearson, Knox County's ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| coordinator, Michelle Portier with Knoxville-Knox County Planning, Alana McKissick with Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| County Community Development, April Tomlin with Knox County Senior Services, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| So, the Knox County team started meeting in April of 2023, and we began the process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| gathering information to submit Knox County's membership application into the Age-Friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| And we completed our membership application and submitted them to AARP for review and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| approval in October of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| I'm happy to report in November 2023, Knox County received their acceptance and plaque| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| welcoming them to the Age-Friendly Network at CAC's annual conference, Aging a Family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| So, Knox County now joins three counties and 11 cities in Tennessee that are part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| And nationwide, there are over 800 cities that are part of the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| So, the work really doesn't stop with acceptance into this network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| Acceptance is really our first step in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| The team is now working on an action plan that will be submitted to AARP for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| And our local team is really committed to this effort, and it continues to meet monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| And our local AARP volunteers have been with us every step of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| And I want to thank both of the Knox County team, as well as our dedicated AARP volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| Mitch Olszewski, Don Lindsey, and Lori Hubbard, as we work on this important initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| And I'm really happy to be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| It's meant a lot to get this designation and take it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| And I'm open to any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| I'll just quickly say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| As one of those who's approaching that age demographic you mentioned, you know, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| is something that I've already started thinking about in future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| Where will I go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| What will I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| What services are present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| So, we talk a lot about young families here in Knox County, but it's so nice to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| that we also have a focus on our aging population so that they can live and grow in community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| So, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=888)|

| 0:15:16| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| We thought this would be appropriate given the item on last month's agenda dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| Iams and parking and just clarification on exactly who you are and what you do do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| Yes, and I really appreciate y'all having me here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| So, thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Thank you to all the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you to our mayor, who I think may still be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| I also want to say that we have several people in the room who are a part of Iams Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| Before you do, introduce yourself and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| I'm Amber Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| I live in Knox County, and I am the CEO of Iams Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| We also have in attendance several of our 26-person board, as well as some past board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| And if they would just raise their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Back here, we also have some of Iams staff members here as well, because we are a busy place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| So, thanks, Sarah, for helping me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| We wanted to talk a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| You asked to learn a little bit more about Iams Nature Center and to learn a little bit about the parking program that we have just put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| So, I'm going to run through this, and I know this looks long, but I promise I'm going to go short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| because I know y'all don't want to go to 11 o'clock tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| But I want to share with you some history of Iams, what the reasonings behind Iams are, and then kind of how we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| So, the first thing to recognize is that Iams Nature Center is a non-profit nature center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| It has existed for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| It has a mission and a vision, and that mission is our law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| It is the thing that drives everything that we do and the lens through which everything we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| So, we ask the question often, does it meet mission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| If it doesn't, we're not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| We have a nice mission statement, but I usually bring that down to we connect people in nature, and that's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| Iams Nature Center lands, and I think this is really important to understand, because Iams as a nature center is actually a public-private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| Iams overlays three different lands, or three different types of land ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| One is Knotts County, which is basically, Knotts County's piece is around Meade's Quarry, and that's indicated in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| The city of Knottsville acreage is in this sort of yellowy kind of color, and then Iams Nature Center acreage is in pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1050)|
| 0:17:39| The Iams Nature Center acreage has been purchased by Iams Nature Center Incorporated over years in order to bring that into the fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| All of the neighbors around Iams know, when you're thinking about selling, get in touch with us first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| because if we can bring this land into the public trust, which is essentially what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| and hold this land for the public, it is there forever, and we all know land is forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| So, land is important, and good land that helps us to meet our mission is always an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| We have a number of features in Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| In fact, Iams is of the nature centers in the U.S., and we have approximately 1,500 nature centers in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| We have the most diverse offerings of any nature center in the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| I think that's really important to understand, because Iams is in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| Iams is Knoxville's jewel, in my mind, and we are functioning essentially as a world-class facility in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1109)|
| 0:18:39| Iams timeline, it's important to recognize, we were begun in 1968 on about 30 acres of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1119)|
| 0:18:47| That started by the garden clubs of Knoxville coming together around the idea of creating a nature park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| Iams lands were added to over that period of time, and around 2001, we were estimating that we had about 100,000 people a year in visitorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1135)|
| 0:19:05| However, that was an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| We have a much better number now based on cell phone pings, which puts us at about 616,000 people accessing Iams every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1147)|
| 0:19:17| We went from 30 acres to 318 acres now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| That acreage is used by over 600,000 people a year, which is a heavy amount of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| It's also important to look at timeline, again, not just for Iams, but for Mead's Quarry, because I know this is the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| That is the county's interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| I want to make sure you understand how the Mead's Quarry parcel came into being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| Mead's Quarry was purchased in 2001 by the county from Vivian Davids of Cobb County, Georgia for $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| This was a parcel of land that at the time was a dumping ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| It was full of old cars, burnt out cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Some of you may remember and may have gone there in your youth and done things we don't want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| because quarries tend to be the place where people go to do stuff they're not supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| That has been a history and something that Iams has been working on for over 20 years to assuage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| to make it into the family-friendly place that it needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| That land was purchased on May 15th of 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| Then the land was given to Iams Nature Center to manage through a 99-year land lease with the county in September 1st of 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1225)|
| 0:20:36| From 2001, from September, Iams has worked at Mead's Quarry to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| One of our staff members, Ben Nanny, has been there that entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| If any of y'all know Ben, you know he is the best man on earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| He has worked to clear tires, to clear everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| Not just that, not just cleaning it up, but building it into a space that is a space for everyone to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| That has happened in public-private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| We have worked with Knox County, with Knoxville City, and with private donors to make all of those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| For example, Knox County built the bathrooms that are down at the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| Iams maintains those bathrooms and works on them until we get to a point where we can't figure out how to fix something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| Then we're really lucky to have Joe Mack and his team to call and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| can you come and check on a plumbing issue for us? It's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Everything that happens at the quarry happens in partnership, just like everything at Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Mead's Quarry work, again, I'll just mention this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| This is a great photo of an old car that was pulled out of the quarry at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| The work that we've done there includes removal of thousands of pounds of trash and everything else you can possibly imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1302)|
| 0:21:50| Building trails, and that trail building happened in partnership with AMBC and tons of volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| Planting warm season grass meadows, gating the caves for the protection of the buried cave salamander that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| construction of overlooks, restoration of historic structures, creation of rock walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| installation of ADA pathway, and most recently, installation of a new swim dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| Cost of operating Mead's Quarry, and this is an important thing to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| Mead's Quarry takes a lot of time and effort. It takes a lot of staff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| Approximately $156,000 is put into Mead's Quarry every year through expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| This is a conservative estimate. It's probably a little bit more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| It depends on the year and how much vandalism and other things like that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| We do have some concessions at Mead's Quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| We have a concessions trailer where we serve drinks and snacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| We also have a boat rental operation that River Sport Outfitters manages for us, and we receive part of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| So total annual income just at Mead's Quarry is $79,000, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| Net income at Mead's Quarry is minus $77,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| So a lot of people would say, wait a minute, that makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| However, we are able to operate Mead's Quarry because it comes under the bigger umbrella of IM's Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| So the funding that we receive through donor dollars, through revenue that we make overall at IM's, helps to operate Mead's Quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1393)|
| 0:23:22| I mentioned that Mead's Quarry is a public-private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| I'm not going to read through all of this for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| I know y'all are in a hurry and busy, but I do want to point out that pretty much every project that we do down there brings together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| often city funds, county funds, and private donor dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| So we can't do what we do at IM's without those partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| A great example are the swim docks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| And if you've been down there this last summer, you saw how amazing it was to have such a diversity of people using Mead's Quarry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| and spreading out on those swim docks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| It just felt better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| It felt good to be down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Those swim docks are there because we had $20,000 from a private donor, and we also had $69,000 from Knox County, which we were very lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1441)|
| 0:24:12| Mayor Jacobs gave us that money to help us with that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And then IM's Nature Center actually did all the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| So we purchased materials with Knox County's funds and with a private donor's funds, and then IM's staff put in the time and effort to build that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1459)|
| 0:24:28| So as I mentioned, the other thing I should mention is the ADA pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| There is city of Knoxville funding on the ADA pathway and Knox County funding, and then IM's Nature Center overseeing all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| So again, just as examples, everything we do is in partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| As far as IM's overall, in 2023, we had 955 members and donors who were maintaining IM's for the use of 616,000 people a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1486)|
| 0:24:58| 24% of the visitors at IM's are from outside the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| So they are tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| They are visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| They are not putting tax money into our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| And yet they are using the space, and all of our donors are helping with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1510)|
| 0:25:18| Just to make sure folks know how our funding models work, IM's is a nonprofit that does receive some of its operating budget from city and county governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1518)|
| 0:25:29| This is a timeline of the operating funds that we've received from city and county government since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| What you're going to see is that funding has gone down at times, but IM's revenue still has gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| And that's because of the really hard work from staff to create great opportunities for people to engage and to raise money as well as to earn money for the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1543)|
| 0:25:53| I do need to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| I'm talking about operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| There is a difference, of course, as you all know, between operating and capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| So we have been very fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| For instance, recently, we've received $1.5 million from the city of Knoxville to help us with our capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| And we've also, over the last two years, received $150,000 from Knox County to also help with capital improvements like that ADA pathway and the swim docks and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1571)|
| 0:26:23| So the beauty of that, again, is that everybody's coming together to support something that could not truly exist well by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| It has to be in partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| I think it's important when we were starting to talk about how we could potentially bring additional funds into IM's because we needed to and how we could do that potentially through parking funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1593)|
| 0:26:46| We looked at our sister organizations in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| The zoo is a really good comparison because they sit on city of Knoxville land but operate as a nonprofit on that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| So it's important to see that for all of its time that IM's has existed, IM's has never charged an admission fee or parking fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| Charging an admission fee is almost impossible for IM's because we have six different vehicular entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| So there's really no way to have everybody come through one entrance to experience IM's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| While most nonprofit nature centers do charge an entry fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| Zoo Knoxville charges $26 per adult and $21 per child and they also have a $5 per car parking fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1644)|
| 0:27:32| It's good to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| It's also good to understand that other nonprofit and government organizations in this county do charge entry fees because they are able to do it because of how they're set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1654)|
| 0:27:45| And IM's has not been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| But yet we are supporting a huge number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| We were really thinking about as we started talking as the board began to speak about parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| And let me just say I've been thinking about this for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| So this is the long game that we've been working on but it was never the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| I think Commissioner Daly has said that there in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| He's been like it's not the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| I don't think we need to go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| But then this year seeing how loved to death IM's has become he finally said yeah I think it's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1693)|
| 0:28:21| And so that's the beauty of having this 26-person board that's made up of county officials, city officials, AMBC, garden clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1701)|
| 0:28:32| All of these people that have state in IM's are part of that decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| So we were looking at the important need to create competitive salaries at IM's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| To create additional education outreach staff so that we can go to populations of people in our county that can't get to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| Because everyone deserves access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| We were looking at the fact that we're looking at new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| All of y'all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| You've been hearing about it in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| How are we going to maintain those new facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Not how are we raising the money for that because my board president back there is going to do all of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| So but how are we going to maintain them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| How are we going to engage underserved communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| How are we going to create partnerships to reduce transportation and other barriers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| And how are we going to create longevity for IM's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Because as a nonprofit leader, my job is to make sure that this organization is strong and steady into the far future, far beyond when I'm going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1760)|
| 0:29:33| So the big question was how can IM's, as a nonprofit that's operated like a free municipal park for 48 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1773)|
| 0:29:40| sustainably provide, maintain, and grow outstanding natural and programmatic resources for an increasing visitorship and a wider community now and well into the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| Things to understand as we move forward is that IM's is a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Most people have always believed that IM's was a fully funded city or county park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| which has made it very difficult for us to raise funds because why would you become a member of a city or a county park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| My taxpayer dollars are already covering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Since its establishment, we've never had an entry fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| As I mentioned, we had difficulty doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| We had too many entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| And we needed public recognition of our nonprofit status to increase memberships and fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| We needed sustainable ways for more people to support the mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| And we also needed just, well, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| So what we've accomplished with the parking in just two months, we've educated the community about IM's Nature Center's nonprofit status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1830)|
| 0:30:39| I cannot tell you how many people have called us and said, I had no idea you were a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| I want to become a member now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| We are, our staff are scrambling to process new memberships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| It has been one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| We significantly, as I said, increased membership, and we've created a way for all users to support IM's, especially those tourists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1855)|
| 0:31:05| and, you know, through that per day parking fee or via their membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| So the result is that now we have a long term funding solution that will increase programmatic outreach, address deferred maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| support current and future infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| And it's now understood that IM's is a nonprofit, which makes overall fundraising easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| The way we went through paid parking, we had a lot of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| We do a lot of due diligence at IM's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| We are a partnership organization, which means all of our partners have to be at the table to have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| We reviewed not only, you know, we not only consulted with our partners and our donors and our volunteers and our community leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| and city and county governments and incorporated all of those suggestions into our paid parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| but we also reviewed memberships at other nature centers across the country, looked at best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| talked about ways that we can increase, we can create more equity in those memberships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| and we reimagined them to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| We also created multiple free parking days throughout the year to provide more equity around access to IM's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| Here are some of our updated memberships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| What you can see here is that you can become a member at $75 all the way up to becoming a 1910 Society member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1933)|
| 0:32:21| But we also have senior memberships for 35, active military and veteran for 50, student for 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| and access for all, which is only $10 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| If you are at or below 133% of the national poverty level or you're in government-assisted housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1952)|
| 0:32:42| then you can get a $10 membership at IM's, which means you have skin in the game, you have become a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| you are part of the IM's team, and yet you are still able to pay within your means, which was incredibly important for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1968)|
| 0:32:58| Our parking fee was really important because, as I mentioned, the impact on IM's has been significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| The amount of impact that many people and that many feet have on a facility is a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| and we wanted to make sure that we could come up with a way to do this that was reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| What we found was the use of QR codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Those QR codes were the thing that opened it up for us because it allows people to be in the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| and to go ahead and pay, and everybody is used to that because you go all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| and you're used to paying those parking fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| We contracted with Metropolis Parking, and Metropolis operates all of it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| People either pay $5 per car per day, or they can pay $50 if they don't want to become a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| They can pay $50 a year for a parking pass, and they have it for a whole year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| but to understand that members park for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| If you're paying $10 as an access for all member, you park for free 365 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| That was important for us to be able to help people become members, to become a part of IM's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| Volunteers also park for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| We have tons of volunteers that come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| They can come to our front desk at any time, say, hey, can I get a bag and some garbage pickers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| and they go out on property and just pick up trash while they're hiking on the trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| It is one of the best things you can do, and if you do that, you get a parking pass for that time that you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| If you volunteer over 20 hours a year at IM's, you get a free parking pass hang tag that's permanent always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| The control equipment, as I mentioned, is QR codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| and our parking plan covers all the major parking lots at IM's, and these are a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| IM's is big, and a lot of people say, wait a minute, Aberdeen, what's the Aberdeen entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| If you've not discovered the Aberdeen entrance, go do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| It is the secret sneaky part of IM's where you don't have to get into all the craziness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| and you can have this wonderful hike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Some of my favorite trails are out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| I mentioned parking rates are $5 a day or $50 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| Members do park for free, and we also have certain event parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| If we have a big event and a lot of people are paying to be part of that, they can have special rates on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| so we're working with everybody to make sure that everybody's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| The rollout plan is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| We brought parking fees in on the 19th of February, and we said that from February to April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| we were in a big grace period, no tangible enforcement or anything along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| Everybody gets a cute little card note on their car if they have not paid saying, hey, don't forget, please pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| And so that's where we are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| We've talked about the fact that we would maybe look at April, and our board meeting is in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| so that works because we can have a discussion at our board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| April through May, looking at a more pointed letter on cars that just say, you know, please, here's why you need to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2153)|
| 0:36:01| This is what you're doing to help, and the fees are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| In June, the board of directors could consider whether or not to move to something that's a little bit more of an enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2165)|
| 0:36:13| We would never in a million years boot or tow a car for noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| However, all of this is based on the board in agreement that this is what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| We could easily go through the next year with absolutely nothing more than a letter saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| don't forget, this is something that you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| Currently, with no enforcement, two weeks ago we were looking at a 34% noncompliance rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| Last week it was 47%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| So 47% of people last week did not pay the parking fee, and our parking company is keeping track of that for us, which is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2201)|
| 0:36:50| This is giving us information, but again, the board has to make decisions about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| which is one of the reasons why having Commissioner Daley on our board is so important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| because he is there to represent everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| I wanted to show you this because this is one of the most remarkable graphs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| What you're seeing are multiple years of new memberships at IAMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| So this is over the course of a year when new members became members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| What you're seeing is a fairly flat membership rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| IAMS has worked so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| I have been here seven years, and I have worked so hard to grow memberships, and all the team has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| and they still stayed pretty flat because everyone thought that we were a city or county park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| As soon as we let the word out that we were going to be charging for parking and that members park for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| the straight-up line, that's our 2020 for new memberships just in January and February of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2264)|
| 0:37:52| It's remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| It is a beautiful thing because it is showing the community coming together around a nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| and supporting something that they love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| So to finish, I will say let's not forget we are a nonprofit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| IAMS is one of the largest nature centers in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| We have the most diverse array of programmatic offerings of any nature center in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| and I can say this because I served for several years on the board of the Association of Nature Center Administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| which is an international organization that serves nonprofit nature centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| and I have been to a whole lot of nature centers in my time, and so I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| and am able to speak with my colleagues, and all of them say to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| I can't believe you all do what you do at IAMS, and I say sometimes I can't either, but we do it, and it's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| We are a world-class organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| We provide best practices and innovative ideas to nature centers around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| We have some of the largest visitor numbers of any nature center in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| To be honest, I can't find any larger yet, but I'm still looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| and we are prepared to build modest but smart facilities to support the extraordinary use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| We are an example of best practices in partnership and engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Commissioners, do we have any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| The information is very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| If I remember back to some of the comments, I think one was related to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| why do I have to pay to come use Meade's Quarry, or, you know, this is a Knox County property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| Why can't I just bring my own boat and enjoy the pool or, you know, enjoy the quarry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| How would you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| So two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| We talked about how much it costs to run Meade's Quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| and so this is not, you know, this is county land, but Iams has a management contract over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| a land lease, and we have been tasked with managing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| As such, we have to have revenue in order to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| So the parking fees are a way to help with that, and it's a way to help in a smaller amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| I know, for instance, Cincinnati Nature Center up in Cincinnati charges $9 per person to come onto their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| and their property overlays a lot of other properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| We're only looking at $5 per vehicle, which is very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| When it comes to the private boats, Meade's Quarry Lake is a small lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| We have a ton of use that happens on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| We have 50 boats that can go out onto that lake from the river sport operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| If you get all of those boats out there, everybody's raft out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| and then allow for all the private boat use there, there's no space to be on the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| You're basically going to be able to walk from boat to boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| So we're trying to make the visitor experience a better experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| We're also trying to help with safety because Meade's Quarry Lake is 100 feet deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| and a lot of folks go out there and may not have appropriate safety gear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| so we want to make sure that they do have that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| In addition, across the road at Iams Landing, which is on the Tennessee River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2461)|
| 0:41:14| we have a free accessible boat dock that anyone can put a boat in or paddleboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| or anything like that at any time of the day and can use it for free, no problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| The Tennessee River is a much bigger space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| You can spread out on that Tennessee River, whereas you can't do that as well within Meade's Quarry Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| Commissioner Fraser, let me just say before you speak, I'm noticing that our lights are not on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| and my microphone is not notifying me who has their lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2504)|
| 0:41:52| so I appreciate the little hand as well as the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Thank you, Ms. Parker, for bringing all this information to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| and thank you to the board members for spending your time with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| I know you've got a tough job, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Just one point of clarification, because this was brought to us by several different constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| the clarification between is the parking fee a required parking fee or is it considered a donation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| It is a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| A donation would be something that we would need to write a donor letter for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| and we would need to make sure that we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| and a donation is something in which you do not receive compensation for the donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| For this, you're paying a fee to park, so it is something that is a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| However, all of the fees that come in through parking go towards maintaining Iams Nature Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| so it is a way for people to maintain the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| So it is not voluntary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| It is a required parking fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| It is a required parking fee, but we are not forcing people to pay it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| So can you call it voluntary? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| But if you're a good-hearted person who wants to follow the rules, you will pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you for your clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| Are there any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| Yes, please, recognizing Junior Commissioner Martinez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| How much of your income comes from Navitat, and is it significant or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| It is not significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| It is very insignificant compared to our overall, so yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2608)|
| 0:43:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Thank you so much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you for the clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| It has been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you very much for y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| I appreciate it, and have a great evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| Our next item is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| This is for agenda items only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| The first person that has signed up is Celia Winchester to address Iams Parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2643)|
| 0:44:16| Give your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| Oh, I wrote too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| I'm Celia Winchester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I'm a Knox County resident, and I am a business owner, a mom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| and I've been on the Iams board for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| So I just wanted to come here today, and Amber covered so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| There are just a few things I wanted to highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| I've used Iams since I was a child and attended field trips at Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| Now, with my three children, they've gone to summer camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and we walk the trails and enjoy, like, searching for salamanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| and my husband's a mountain biker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| So we love Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| What we've noticed over the last few years is significant wear and tear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| a lot of trash and graffiti and other, like, vandalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| And so what we see is instead of being able to interact with the Iams staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| members who are so great about sharing information about native plants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| and animals, instead we're seeing them hauling trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| and cleaning graffiti and maintaining bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| And since we have not had a significant increase in funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| and in revenue that coincides with the significant increase in visitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| that really ramped up during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| we're actually seeing, like, their time moving from mission-oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| programming to simply maintaining the 318 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| And so as a board member, I see that firsthand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| and it's really frustrating to see this, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| beautiful space not being respected and properly maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| And so we hope as a board that we're able to generate enough revenue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| better compensate the staff, add additional staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| and maintain the property so that we really can be mission-focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| And so that's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Oh, just one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Navitat pays about $32,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Also, last year our total revenue was $1.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| and I wanted to point out something that was on Amber's graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| Our operating budget was $1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| That's how much income we needed to bring in to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| City and county funding was 9% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| About 41%, Melanie, I'm not going to get it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| but it's donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| So that's donor income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| The other 50% approximately is generated by the IM staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| They are working at summer camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| They are hosting events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| They are coordinating weddings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| They're generating the revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| So, again, you know, they're really putting in the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| and we hope that this parking fee will also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| further support them in their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Next speaker is Bo Townsend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| Bo Townsend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| I've been involved at IM's Nature Center since 1989 as an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| as executive director back then, as a board member, and as a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| And I didn't realize that I could park for free as a volunteer, Amber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| having volunteered the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I actually am more than happy to pay the fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| and we pay a lot more than that because we support the mission of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| I was there back in 1989 when we first signed the contract with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| for $120,000, and you can see what's happened to the Nature Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| and what we do in the last 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| It's been phenomenal, the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| The people come here, I drive through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| I actually, as a volunteer, I'm one of the ones who picks up the diapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| the cigarette butts, and everything else in the parking lot because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| don't have enough staff to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| So the volunteers do a lot of that work, as Amber mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| As you can see, it has been phenomenal what has occurred at the Nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| People come to Knoxville, and a lot of times that's the first place they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| So the parking fee, we reluctantly have had to look at that because we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| to look at diverse revenue streams, as you all well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Trying to run a county is not simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| Trying to run a nonprofit is not simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| So we've reluctantly gone ahead with this, but I would add that people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| still access the center for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| They're not charged to go on the trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| People ride their bikes there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| You can access other transportation there and still take advantage of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| we have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| We also offer low-fee programming and other things that we do for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| It's a great partnership and one that, as Amber pointed out, we have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| providing a lot of those amenities for free to the county and to visitors to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| the county for the last 35 years and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| So thank you for your time, and I appreciate the opportunity for you all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| hear a little bit more about what IMES does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| And you can see from the energy that Amber brings forth, our staff are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| committed, as is the board and all the volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| And just as a general comment, I might suggest Mr. Townsend stood up here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2970)|
| 0:49:38| spoke, and as a volunteer he said he wasn't aware that volunteers parked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| And I know two of the gentlemen that spoke to us a couple months ago talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| about all the hours that they had put in volunteering at IMES and were quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| upset about the parking fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| So I might just suggest maybe there was a little bit of a hiccup in this rollout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| and perhaps the requirements or non-requirements to not have to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| parking, there may be some other ways for you to get that word out so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| volunteers do know that they don't have to pay the parking fee if they choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| So just an observation from the people I've heard in the last couple months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| Our next public speaker is Keith Britt, speaking to Item 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| Name and county of residence, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Keith Britt, 506 Milton Drive, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| I am an ardent supporter of Knox County Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| They improve property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| They drastically improve pedestrian and bicycle safety, in particular for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| school-age children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| And they improve the overall health of the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| Knox County Greenways are a community resource that have tremendous benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| for all of those that have access to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| The Greenway expansion approvals and right-of-ways that are up for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| to this commission are ones that I would have supported fully months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| But given that this Greenway will benefit those that vehemently oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| including affordable housing in the areas this Greenway will serve, it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| antithetical not only to your values as an inclusive government body, but to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| the proclamation introduced by the mayor earlier in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| And I quote, Knox County is dedicated to fostering fairness and equal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| opportunity in housing, recognizing its pivotal role in promoting positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| social, cultural, and economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| I am not encouraging you to stop Greenway development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| But you are going to have to let the citizens of this county know, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| particular the Choteau community, that if they want to be included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| expanding community resources, they need to be inclusive in welcoming the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| rest of this county's communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| So please use this opportunity to set an example before the problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| exasperated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| We've got to build tens of thousands of new housing units in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| over the coming decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| And we're going to have to reject isolationism and embrace our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| in order to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you for your time and Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| The next speaker is Alan Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| Mr. Hill, would you like to speak now or would you like to wait until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| before we discuss the agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3166)|

| 0:59:10| And then a few, I guess, last fiscal year, we did install a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| turn lane and relocate the entrance for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| And then this year, obviously, we're proposing here as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| these plans to, if you're kind of familiar with it, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| primarily some steep drop offs pretty much right at the white| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| They're kind of near the YMCA area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Those areas will be filled in and they'll have to be a four to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| one traversable slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| Right now, if you go off there, your vehicle is most likely going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| to overturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| So this would provide for someone to be able, if they do get off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| actually correct their vehicle back onto the roadway in a safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| In addition to actually widening, making the lanes consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Right now, they kind of vary through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| We're going to make them consistently 11 foot wide, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| well as add two foot paved shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| If you'll notice through the curves, the trailer's off track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| and they just beat that shoulder down really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| So we are going to, you know, add two foot of paved shoulder in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| addition to making the lane widths consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| As it relates to the greenway facilities, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Commissioner Jay's worked very hard on those things and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| done the boardwalk that goes up under there, under the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| bridge and the new bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| We've extended the greenway from the roundabout up to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| And then this project, we'll extend it from the cove to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| roundabout that has some pedestrian facilities at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| Choteau Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| So obviously, you know, pedestrian safety, pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| vehicle safety projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| So we're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| There are 12 tracks of property that will need to be acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| Most of those tracks are minor in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| There's some slope easements, construction easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| There's only two fee acquisitions and fee means actual real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| property that will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| And even those are relatively small and don't impact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| remaining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| So we're excited about the project and if approved, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| hopefully get started with construction late this year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| hopefully finish up maybe late next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Well, I see some other lights are on, so I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| I'd like to echo Mr. Britt's comments that these are huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| improvements that's going out north shore in the Choteau area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| and they're not on an island out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| And they may sometimes they think that they're on an island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| and they want things their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| To get things your way, you've got to have growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| And part of this funding is growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| And I think you, I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| I appreciate you coming up and standing up and saying what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| needed to be said, that, you know, the growth plan is coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| up for a vote in the next week or two for Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| You know, hopefully they're wise enough to know that they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| an island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| They need Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| They need our sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| They need our planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| They need everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| So hopefully, thank you, Mr. Britt, for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Any other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| I just had a quick question, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| Director Stone, what's the total cost for these acquisitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| And at this point, we haven't done appraisals yet, but I kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| of thought that might come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| So I did some rough numbers based on some of the recent appraisals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| I would estimate somewhere around 60 to 65 thousand dollars for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| the totality of the 12 tracks of acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| Commissioner Jay, is your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Also, thank you, Mr. Snowden, for the hard work on this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| I know the timing of things don't always match up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| We actually started this project in 20 August of 2018 in its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| totality, and this is heading towards the last phase of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| So it's been quite some time, regardless of when zoning or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| other issues come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| But I also wanted to add just for the community's sake, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| we'll certainly convey this out to all parties involved, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| the mayor's team, communications team, has been working on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| sort of informational video that will be released soon that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| help explain the timeline, the impact, the overall safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| projects and sort of communicate how we're bundling all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| together and trying to accomplish a common goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| So hopefully that will educate the public a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| Just a clarification question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| This says 11, and Jim, I think you just said 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| Do we need to amend this to 12 instead of 11 tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3831)|
| 1:04:01| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Yeah, that is a typo up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| I'm glad you caught that, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| We do have 12 acquisitions and not 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| So my apologies for that technical oversize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| I'll amend the motion to say 12, approving item number 25 at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| 12 tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| Thank you, Commissioner Schoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Oh, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| The other thing I wanted to just point out is I thought this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| a great effort on the part of the engineering department that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| by combining the two projects, the safety road improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| projects with the greenway, it's now going to be a lower cost for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| the taxpayers to accomplish this project as opposed to if we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| did the safety improvements now and then came back in six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| and did the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| So I commend your office for allowing that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| concurrently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| And in addition to that, you know, there's 17,000 cars a day out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Anytime you get in traffic and close the lane, it's going to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3912)|

| 1:05:22| ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| And just the last comment would be that Mayor Jacobs has done an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| outstanding job of supporting the efforts out here for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3928)|

| 1:06:08| Commissioner J did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| That's what he did on the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| He wanted it to combine both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3972)|

| 1:06:33| Yes, if it's okay to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| I could do a motion on 29 to move forward with that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=3995)|

| 1:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4092)|

| 1:08:16| Hill is going to oppose my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Can I give the presentation before he decides to oppose it, before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| he sees it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Would you like me to state my info and then I'll answer his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4106)|

| 1:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| I am here to speak on this item and Item 43-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| But according to what Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| said, I would love to hear his presentation first before making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Commissioner J., the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Commissioners, I first became aware of what this overall issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| as a public safety issue, really, in 2020 in the Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| This was, many of you know, Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| Don Wagner, who is very active in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| And he contacted me about a utility pole that had been hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| right outside of his house and had essentially been hit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| tied up to a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| The whole pole was broken and had been tied there, and he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| worried that it was going to either get hit again or fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| into the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| And actually, it was a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| It was actually owned by, I believe it was at the time he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| was either AT&T or LCUB, but reached out to the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| We ended up working on the removal, but he was unable to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| that as a private citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| And get so much response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| And so, you know, as commissioners, sometimes we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| and advocate for our citizens and bring it to the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| But it really sort of sparked an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| And I'll just say that once you once you begin to see these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| you can't unsee them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| And I encourage you all to look at every virtually every stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| intersection or or major thoroughfare in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| And so I kept seeing more of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| What is really the double poles, the old poles and the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| poles right next to each other that have been replaced and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| brought this up to Director Snowden and started to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| about how do we begin to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| And what does it look like from a public safety standpoint and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| We invited a group of telecom companies and pole owners and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| utilities to meet as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| We met four times since August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| I started this as one ordinance that was very focused on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| entire big picture that was focused on how many double poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| were out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| And and looking at an ordinance that would put a timeline on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| those with penalties if they weren't removed in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| And it really sort of was very structured, pretty clear in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| you in our discussions, the utilities and telecom said it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| was it was really unreasonable to put a specific timeline on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| all the removals, given the vast nature of this and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| complications involved and also the complications with the pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| owners are not the same as the ones who are on old poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| It's the telecoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4287)|

| 1:11:56| that our utility and pole owner companies are have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4316)|

| 1:12:13| address our right away safety and then a separate ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| is specific to poles that are in a precarious or dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4337)|

| 1:12:39| So that's really the breaking of it into an ordinance and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| resolution and working on the project in a bigger way over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4362)|

| 1:18:20| but the telecom remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| And then go forward, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4703)|

| 1:18:29| So what is unsafe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| Was it the pole owner themselves, or was it our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| codes department within Engineering and Public Works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| And this is an example of why I feel that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Engineering and Public Works, who maintains it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| away, should be the body that determines when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| something is unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| This is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| It is Harvey Road near Amberglades, District 5, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| we had a significant amount of stress and tension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| and called it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| The pole owner is LCUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| They contacted LCUB and said, we feel like this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| LCUB reported back that they did not see it as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| safety issue, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| And days later, the pole snapped, the road had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| be closed, neighborhoods lost power, and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| systems had to be transferred to a new pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| This is an example of why I feel that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| maintain the safety of, and right away, it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| be inspected by our codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| And I also just wanted to kind of show you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| every slide I've shown you is something that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| gathered within the last six months, but just within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| the last few days, this is, what is that date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| 2-9-24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| I saw this in the Carnes Facebook page, where a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| couple of years ago, there was a sign that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| the road was going to be shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| So just a real-life example of kind of where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| are today, and why double poles in our right-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| are both a safety hazard and something that should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| be addressed. And then last slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| Thank you. You can just leave it on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| slide, if you will. Again, this is just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| conglomeration of the things that you will see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| all over your district, and once you begin to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| that, I think it's a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| I think it's a good compromise to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| unfortunately, public safety matter with a clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| that does have penalties, if not appropriately taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| care of for citizens, I think the resolution is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| good compromise to be able to say to our utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| companies and our telecom companies, we need your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| help with this, and we want you to begin working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| on it, and we want to meet with you quarterly and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| start addressing these issues one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| Mr. Allen, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| Should I state my name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| We've got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| Okay, got me. Well, thank you for giving us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| time just to speak a few words here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| I do want to say I really do appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| Commissioner Jay, you bringing this before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| for our attention, and appreciate the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| you've done, and Director Snowden, too, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| bringing this before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| AT&T has been part of these meetings since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| November-December time frame, along with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| poll owners and other utility providers, sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| called attachers that don't own the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| So we agree with your intent to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| right-of-way safe, and also aesthetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| pleasing, with visual appearance as well, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| as came up in one of our meetings, to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| right-of-way litter, I think is a key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| point, and I think Commissioner Daley referred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| it to, so we appreciate the intent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| I will say that AT&T works hard to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| a safe network. That's a priority for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| anything that we do. And we want to also be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| a good corporate citizen and good stewards of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| the right-of-way that we are able to use, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| we actually pay for permit fees and pay taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| on our capital investment here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| We also feel that AT&T, I can't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| further, but AT&T and me personally have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| responsive to several commissioners here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| commission when they've called or emailed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| with concerns. It might take a few days to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| get it rectified, but we think we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| responsive on any initiative like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| As I mentioned, we've attended these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| since November. We've also worked through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| several draft iterations with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Jay and Director Snowden and other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| on the draft iterations, first of all on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| an ordinance and then breaking it out secondly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| to a resolution and an ordinance. So we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| gone through several of those. We still think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| there are some other changes that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| made. So with that said, we really take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| the position on the ordinance, the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| ordinance, which is item 43, number 0-24-3-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| that you postpone that would be our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| And we think that it could be actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| consideration there of overstepping into an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| area of jurisdiction that the county might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| really should be into, that it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| potentially encroaching on state and federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| statutes as well. I can enumerate some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| those other detailed concerns, but I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| going to take the time to do that now unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| called upon later. So we think the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| we would propose that this item 29 resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| not only address the double or what do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| call it, Commissioner Jay, the double or extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| poles or whatever it's called out there, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| unnecessary pole, redundant, yeah, double or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| redundant poles that you add to that verbiage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| the verbiage of the, you can call it, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| you would say, the damaged or dangerous poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| so that the resolution covers any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| pole issue that you might consider dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| or aesthetically not pleasing or whatever with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| the double or redundant poles. And we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| if you do that, then go ahead and do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| make it go for a year, evaluate it in 2025,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| and then see if there really needs to be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| ordinance, because I think you're already calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| on four different quarterly meetings, which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| could work through that for sure, and we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| be very open to that. So, again, we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| that it's imperative that the county work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| together with all the pole owners and telecom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| providers, because we have such a growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| county, we all need power requirements from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| LCUB and KUB, and we all, as we well know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| need broadband everywhere, and our friends at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| KUB and LCUB are also now in that business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| along with Charter, Comcast, WOW, and many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| others too, so there's several folks in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| mix. It's interesting that there are pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| owners and pole or utility providers, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| key thing there is coordination, so it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| very complex situation when you do have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| move a pole or move attachments from one to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| the other, because several are involved in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| process, and it has to be done in serial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| manner, in a synchronous fashion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| So, we're already, as information, all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| pole owners in Knox County and all the telecom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| providers are part of a cooperative database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| The acronym is ENGINES, but it stands for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| National Joint Utility Notification System, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| so actually the county can participate in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| too, and they can see all the tickets that go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| back and forth between all these groups that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| we've already mentioned of who needs to go next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| what needs to be done, has some time frames| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| associated with that, so it's a self-governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| system that we already have in place that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| that, so with that said, we, again, appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| the intent, Commissioner Jay and others on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| commission for wanting to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| It is important. We don't take it lightly at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| all. It does take time, and it takes a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| lot of folks working, and we look forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| being part of the resolution that thinks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| the resolution takes place over the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| ordinance, so thank you for your time, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| can answer questions now or later, whatever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Thank you, Madam Chair. Due to my current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| employment with a pole attacher, I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| recusing myself for this item, number 29, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| the utility ordinance item, number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| Pardon me, not 41, 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| All right. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| Thank you, Madam Chair. Commissioner Jay, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| page 101, page 2, where you have the 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| whereas, what is the reference to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| plants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| Tell me again the page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| It is page 2. It is the 7th whereas, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| starts the purpose of this ordinance, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| the second sentence says their plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| What does that mean in this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Read the whole sentence. I'm just trying to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| Okay, whereas the purpose of this ordinance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| to require utilities that use Knox County roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| and right-of-ways to properly remove their plants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| comma, cable lines, comma, equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| Mr. Snowden, I believe that is a reference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| Mr. Snowden, I believe that is a sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| jargon term for something to do with the telecom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| I'm sure Mr. Hill can speak. It is a synonym| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| for their facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| It is kind of just another way of saying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| utility facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| Okay, and then I guess question to Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| and Mr. Jay, I know the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| regulates the utilities in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| Is there anything that in Title 65 of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| Code annotated that we would be going against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| if either the resolution or the ordinance was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| When we spoke, Charlie Sturkey from the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| County Law Department was intimate in drafting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| this with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| And when we spoke at length with Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| and Mr. Sturkey about essentially our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| maintenance of the public right-of-way, and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| said that it felt like this was written in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| way that allowed us to focus on the jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| of our right-of-way, which is the public land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| and that we had police powers and Mr. Moyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| may say it more eloquently, but essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| police powers and jurisdiction to maintain our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| own right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| We give permission to both utility companies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| telecom companies to operate in our right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| as we do with other construction facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| and we have the ability to manage our own right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| as appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| Well, and Lenore City Utilities has the poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| 100% in my district as well as a big portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| Commissioner Oster's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| But in my time on commission, it seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| when a pole has been replaced, Lenore City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| Utilities has been right on top of replacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| their lines, and it's everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| TDS and everybody down the line has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| And it appears on the surface, and maybe you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| could help me out with this, Mr. Snowden, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| TDS used to have an office in Farragut where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| if we did have an issue, we could approach them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| and it was handled pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| Now everything goes to Madison, Wisconsin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| Has that delayed the process now of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| some of these safety issues corrected where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| there's a pole that needs to be removed but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| TDS or WOW or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| I don't know if I would say delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| We still have good local contacts for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| So my office and my utility manager can reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| out to certain people at even those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| They may not have a biggest presence here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| locally, but we still can get a hold of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| folks. And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Typically the power companies do get out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| and move the lines really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| But there are a lot of entities there that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| at the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| Okay. And then I just wanted to follow up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| say that in my limited exposure when AT&T was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| identified as the person that needed to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| their stuff, whenever I contacted Mr. Hill, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| were on top of it right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| So I just want to say I appreciate what your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| company has done for my limited exposure and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| getting some of those things addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| I've got maybe a question for Mr. Hill and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| Mr. Snowden and then Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| So I got a little too familiar with utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| poles and everything during the tornadoes in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| district. And LCV was great to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| because we had some poles that were dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| at that point. And after the tornadoes and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| had a great working relationship with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| I think they've been rather concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| And so I guess you made the comment you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| have telecom has an agreement with the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| companies, correct? You guys already have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| agreement that it kind of works down like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| said. Okay. And that's where you kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| feel like the ordinance may kind of step on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| your guys' toes for what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| What you guys have already got in place. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| that right? Well, so two things. We all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| participate in that system. I'll just call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| engines for short, NJUNS. We participate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| that. So that's a process by which we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| work together and everybody can see exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| what's going on with any given pole at any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| given time. And again, the county, if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| chose to, can also be a member of that system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| and see the same things and kind of monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| We also have formal private contracts we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| call joint user agreements with KUB and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| LCUB, anybody else that we attach to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| owns a pole. And so in that agreement, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| are all kinds of verbiage there that regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| how we work, but it also talks about fees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| we pay them to attach to their poles, fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| they pay us to attach to our poles, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| fees they pay us to attach to their poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| And at the end of the year, we kind of do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| an accounting, settle up on who pays who what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| because we're all attaching to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| There is a clause in here, I'll go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| and address that, there's a portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| utility ordinance that says that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| like for us to potentially disclose what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| those agreements are and timelines, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| that's one of those portions where we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| it's overstepping because that's a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| agreement. If those are disclosed in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| public environment, those are exposed publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| for public records acts, and there's things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| that us and maybe Comcast and WOW and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| don't want disclosed, so that's another area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| where we're talking about maybe getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| those agreements, so it complicates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| We welcome participation in the engines deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| we welcome cooperation in meetings, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| better communication, you know, we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| about better communication, so hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| does that help? It does, and so let me make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| sure that I understand it. There are, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| say you've got Comcast, WOW, AT&T, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| whoever else. Yeah, a lot of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| And, but each one of you have a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| on the pole, correct? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| So you have to take those down in the order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| that they go, correct? Right, and reattach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| right. Right, so if we've got one that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| responding quick as AT&T or Comcast does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| then you guys really are kind of at a halt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| however, LCUB or KUB can override that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| that is in a dangerous location, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| Right, so what typically, and I can't speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| for exactly how that part works, but typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| what happens, let's say there's an automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| wreck or a car accident, and you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| a pole that's knocked down, and we go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| there, and KUB, let's say, owns a pole, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| go ahead and erect a new pole, they move the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| power, then what we have to do is exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| write what you just said, whoever's next in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| the line on communications, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| Comcast, WOW, whoever, they go first, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| the next one down, then we happen to be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| last to go, or in TDS case, TDS out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| or Frontier, Frontier's, you know, the telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| line, that part of power, so we are always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| the ones that go last, so we do have to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| order, so that's what does take time, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| you have to coordinate that, and all that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| done through the engine system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| So if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| It's perfect, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Director Snowden, I've got a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| things for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| How many times this year have you gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| calls in your department for the poles, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| the utility owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| Not very often, Commissioner, I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| we probably receive just a couple a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| and for the most part, the ones we receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| when we speak with the utility owner, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| extremely cooperative, that one location that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| Commissioner Jay showed was really the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| time we've ever had an issue rise where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| was a difference of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| So, Commissioner Jay, I think what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| doing by cleaning it up is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| My fear is we are kind of getting into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| situation with utility companies where I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| there is a little, an ordinance could look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| like a little bit of an overstep for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| That's the way that I'm seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| But, two, I'm trying to decide how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| going to add, what we're going to add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| And I think that's going to depend on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| how we're going to add this on top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| everything else that EPW is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Because I know just for my district, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| probably talk to this man nine times a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| And as far as trash that we've got, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| dumping trash, places that they shouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| to any other issues that I'm calling him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| So I guess I'm trying to determine how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| we're going to add this on top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| everything else that EPW is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| And I'm trying to determine with his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| staff that he has right now, how, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| that's going to be effective for EPW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| And for two, I have to wonder, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| is just my question, and Director Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| or Commissioner Jay can take this, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| is this, I feel like that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| Director Snowden over these years have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| made a really good relationship with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| utility companies and probably telecom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| companies as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| And it almost kind of to me looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| it puts him in kind of that hammer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| position where now he still has to rely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| on these people to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| So I guess that for that situation, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| kind of makes me wonder how that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| I mean, how are you seeing that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| I guess that's what I'm just trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| I will say we did speak about the let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| talk about the resources internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| They feel like they have the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| internally to do this now with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| current personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| And again, the resolution focuses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| working with them each quarter to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| we're not doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| And I think there's some incorrect Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| Snowden has said the capacity to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| is there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| I think that the real issue comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| to they're not doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| If there's an emergency storm, sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| everybody rushes in and does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| But if there's not an emergency like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| major storm, power changes over really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| quickly and everyone else just goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| and it's evident by the data that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| showed me, currently between 18TKUB and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| LCUB, there are 2,955 poles in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| engine system awaiting telecom transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| and removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| So nearly 3,000 poles currently in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| The power's been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| New pole is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| And the old system has not been transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| to the new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| And so we work on an agreement as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| resolution to say we want to work alongside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| with you if you do want to be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| And then I do agree when we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| situation like a storm or a major accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| yes, everybody rushes in to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| But as evidenced by what you've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| most of the time what happens is they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| rush in to help, the power gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| transferred, and the power is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| engine system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| And so when you say all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| situations look really dangerous to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| citizens, I would be really surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| And I think that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| The ordinance has to we have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| ordinance now to say you have to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| this for the safety of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| And so when we got into this, we realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| we do need a clock that says, yes, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| have to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| Because this is our current county right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| now where stuff is hanging over and laying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| over and getting ready to hurt somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| We've got to put everybody on the clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| and say you've got to take care of this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| a timely way or we are going to fine you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| or we are going to withhold permits if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| don't take care of our situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| And so that's why we got into it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| realized we don't have any stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| We have to address the bigger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| And the bigger issue is not going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| away unless we work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| We can do that with the current capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| And I understand it's not revenue generating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| I understand it's not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| But this problem is going to persist long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| And the rate that we're growing as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| community, I'm concerned if we don't start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| addressing it now and we don't deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| the immediate safety concerns, there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| going to be a way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| And like I say, I appreciate the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| aspect because I've called and had to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| some poles removed and they've done it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| because it was an emergency situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| So on the fines, on the ordinance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| fines, will that go to whoever we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| determine is still on that pole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Let's say it's AT&T and WOW then or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| It would be the pole owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| And I will say that each pole owner has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| an agreement with the telecom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| And they have actually provided those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| agreements to us, to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Snowden's team, and most of them have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| enforcement mechanism where they have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| own penalties and enforcement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| They just don't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| So they have their own agreements with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| utility company or with the telecom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| companies, you've got to do XYZ in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| certain time frame, but they just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6202)|

| 1:43:26| It's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| We have a lot of stuff going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| They're putting in new stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6210)|

| 1:43:39| This is the trash that's been kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| thrown on the street and the trash that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| been thrown on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| You know, I might ask one more question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| just to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| Snowden, when we first addressed, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| honed in on the immediate safety ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| Can you talk a little bit about your team's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| role in maintaining the right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Public safety is always my biggest thing, that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| We want to maintain as safe as roads as possible and one of the things that we all know in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| our community is our roads have no shoulders, I mean they just don't and that's a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| and we're hopefully going to try to modernize those as part of the advanced Knox process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| but if you run off the road in Knox County, there's a good chance you're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| I mean there just is and that's unfortunate and we're trying to do things with that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| some of the things that we can do to improve that is reduce obstructions in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| National averages show that about 50% of all the fatalities are roadway departures, somebody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| run off the road and they've hit an obstruction in the right-of-way so from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| I think that would be the benefit here is to eliminate, you know if you got two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| poles out there, if you could eliminate one or two of those, then from my perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| that's what I would see as the primary public benefit here that I spoke to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6301)|
| 1:45:07| Jay about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| Mr. Hill, you're with AT&T, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Do we have any other utility companies or telecom companies present here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| My question is, and I was just asking if you all were here to respond, Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| mentioned there's roughly 2,900, 3,000 poles in the system awaiting removal and that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6329)|
| 1:45:37| the joint user agreements you do have penalties and timelines but you're not executing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| or following through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| I was just wondering if you all could respond to that and just give me a little bit of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| of why that is or what's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| I know that many of you had those discussions at the meetings that were held for the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| and I was able to attend one of those and I know there was some discussion but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| could just kind of share here too that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| I'll go ahead if I can first since I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| So there are, as I mentioned, there are joint user agreements we have where we reciprocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| between KUB and LCB for our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| TDS probably has similar ones I would think in Frontier with the pole owners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| We have structure access agreements with people like Comcast, Charter, Wow, Verizon, Zayo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| Windstream, Iris Networks to say the least and we're working on structure access agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| for the new broadband entities of LCB and KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| So you've got two types of agreements that are out there and to make a matter of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| record, AT&T has not submitted our agreements to Director Snowden because we think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| proprietary information and we didn't want it disclosed for public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| So there are procedures within there because there are agreements and timelines like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| mentioned but that's a contractual agreement between our company and the company we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| the agreements with, whether it be joint user or structure access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| It's not an agreement with the county or municipality within the region that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| So that's a point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| Now the number of attachments you mentioned, Commissioner Jay, I'd have to go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| get the details of that if there's 2,900 kind of pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| Well there's a lot of things that are pending in that database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| I think a good starting point for the resolution is let's take a factual, let's do a factual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| analysis of what is existing today, whether it be damaged or dangerous or redundant or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6454)|
| 1:47:43| double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| And those two, and we agree, let's take care of the safety issues tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| I mean, let's start at 8 a.m., 7.30 for some workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| 7.30 tomorrow, getting anything that's dangerous out of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| Totally agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| So I have that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| But then let me also address Commissioner Oster with the penalties I think that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| now in the utility ordinance are not monetary but there are other type of penalties like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| they said, Commissioner Jay, I think he stated it could be revoking our permits or stop giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6491)|
| 1:48:19| us permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| And that's one of those areas where we really, really, really think that's overstepping the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| bounds and getting into state and federal statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| And quickly, just to respond to, I guess, and you hit on this, but the timeliness of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| Even though there are those joint user agreements, it was stated that there is an illusion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| you just don't follow through or you just don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| So if you would respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| Well, I think the term was mentioned, they don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| We care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| But there are a lot of things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| So it's not that we don't care, but we do have priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| But there are a lot of things we have to do in a coordinated fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| So there's a mechanism there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| We have time commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| It might seem to the people outside looking in that we're not doing anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| But we're actually doing a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| So my question, I guess, is I'm trying to figure out, if you're not doing it now, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| will this make you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| I mean, what if it's not timely in your current processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| We're going to continue with our current method of operation to do what we feel needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| done for safety reasons, for new orders, for repair, and for cleanup items, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| So they're all important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| We're going to continue working hard like we always have for our customers and for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| areas that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| I think the resolution and what it would put forth would be an additional, maybe, communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6581)|
| 1:49:48| vehicle to let us communicate with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| The city of Knox is welcome to participate if they wanted to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| So that we do communicate as a group, an entity, with the folks to tell them what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| So I don't think there's anything wrong with that communication part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| I just think, hesitant on the ordinance that would invoke penalties in terms of the penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6605)|
| 1:50:13| being non-monetary, but actual revoking of permits and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| And also putting extraordinary requirements on top of what is already in our contractual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| agreements with the partners we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| They're represented from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| Good evening, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| Erin Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| I'm here with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6636)|

| 1:50:40| I was not prepared to speak, so if you mind, I'll just focus on kind of the questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| you asked and provide some perspective in terms of scale and the relative number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| that, roughly 3,000 poll number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| The majority of those, if I followed the math correctly, are likely associated with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| We have, across our system, 120,000 polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| We maintain close to 6,000 miles of electric lines, so you can imagine that we have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| of polls around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| We also have, as has been alluded to, a robust infrastructure maintenance program that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6668)|
| 1:51:15| mean that we are replacing polls very regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| And we work with seven attachers across our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| So that engine system that Mr. Hill spoke to is a very important part of our work order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6681)|
| 1:51:28| process in which we put the poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| The attachers then move down their list, and then we will go and pick up the poll at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| the end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| What's the turnaround of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| I didn't mean to interrupt you, but by the time it gets into the system, when it gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| into engine, what's the turnaround time to get those polls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| So, and this is where, you know, we recognized in 2021 that we did have too much of a pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| backlog of those polls that we call them like ready to poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| And so since 2021, we have reduced that backlog by over 40% and have a commitment to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| to work much more expeditiously to pull those polls once the next to go notice has come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| back to us that the poll is ready to poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| So we recognize that backlog, we've pulled over 2000 polls just in the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| as a result of trying to focus on that intention and would continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| And as has been alluded to the resolution of meeting quarterly to not only report back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| to the county, but talk amongst the utility providers to coordinate and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| we're staying on top of that intention is something that we are happy to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| Did you have something to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Yes, yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| I did want to kind of clarify one thing because obviously these are great partners of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| We've always wanted to work with them and I feel like always have in regard to the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| You know, I think it talks in the ordinance that they have seven days to remediate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| immediate safety concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| So it's not that we're, we would not be asking for them to relocate everything onto that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6780)|
| 1:53:07| new poll just to remediate that safety concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| You know, if the poll splintered and potentially out in the road, as long as they set a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| poll and move the facilities and remove that immediate public hazard, that clock would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| be stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| So I want to just clarify that because that is something that they were, you know, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| folks were concerned about and we were as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| We do not want to set an unrealistic expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6815)|
| 1:53:44| Perhaps this would be better for Ms. Gill or Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| Is there a process when a new poll is installed, for example, the, I think it's Wrights Ferry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| you pointed out that had new polls basically all the way down, old polls and we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6836)|
| 1:54:03| sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| Eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| I know because I drove it for 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Is there, is there a process in place when, when a new poll by the poll owner is put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6849)|
| 1:54:16| that, that there is a follow, a follow-up on getting back to pull the old poll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6856)|
| 1:54:23| I mean, how does, how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| In theory, our answers would be similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| So again, with potentially up to seven attachers on a poll, the mentioned the engine system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6873)|
| 1:54:40| is a work order trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| So it, it, once that request or, you know, the utility sets a new poll, we then enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| the work order request to go to the first attacher and it moves on down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| So then when the last attacher is out, they then in theory would put in the next to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6891)|
| 1:54:57| comes back to the poll owner as KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| And at that point we would go out and pull the poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| As I mentioned in response to commissioner Frazier, we did recognize that we were getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| a little long coming back to pull those polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| The other issue that does sometimes happen is if that engines ticket isn't entered because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| the attacher doesn't enter it, then that would, of course, we would get no flag to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| out and pull that poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| And I think that is part of the motivation behind wanting to have this quarterly coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| so that we don't miss progress that has been made simply because the tech in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| did not enter things properly or perhaps created a new ticket where the old ticket really ought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| to have been utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Is that a fair assessment, Ellen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| And I did hear you acknowledge that clearly there must be a breakdown somewhere because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6940)|
| 1:55:49| it would seem unreasonable for a, when a new poll is put up for an old poll to sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| That's probably a fair statement in anybody's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6958)|
| 1:56:05| I might just add, the engine system, once she mentioned it goes into the system and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| the next in line is ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| So it's not like then, let's say there's two cable companies there and then AT&T at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| I don't think our guys will spend a lot of time looking for tickets of going to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| person to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| Like, okay, when are you going to go so we can go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| So we get those notifications when they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| If there's a delay in the order of that coming off, then that just kind of, it's a domino| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| effect that extends the whole time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| So again, if the poll owner, us, if we insert a new poll and notice somebody's not moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7003)|
| 1:56:51| we've already put those tickets in, it would be, we could take the, well, but we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| take the role, I have to ask the question actually, do we take a role of going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| like they did and say, hey, we put in this new poll, nobody's moved, we need to get ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| out of there, the old poll or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| So that's a point I can take back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| But there's a process there is all I'm saying and so, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7029)|
| 1:57:17| I hear your concern about, utilities concerns about dealing with permits might be overstepping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7037)|
| 1:57:28| So just as a comment, that would lead me to believe then, probably, if anything like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7048)|
| 1:57:36| this goes through, there probably would need to be a monetary penalty because then we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| be messing with permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| I mean, I'm just saying, if we get to that phase, then that might be a little bit cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| Madam Chair, we originally had that in the ordinance, but the point came up of the poll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7070)|
| 1:58:00| who are you finding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| Are you finding the poll owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Are you finding each individual person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| Are you tracking each individual company per poll per time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| It got very complicated and also the poll owner essentially said, it's not our fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| if the other person doesn't move and you're going to penalize us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| So we pulled all that back and essentially, and I really, really encourage you to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| the resolution separate from reading the ordinance because it basically says, we may all be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| partners right now, but we don't make laws for when everybody behaves and it works well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| We make laws for those who don't and so it really gets down to, let's say we have a telecom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| company that continues to ignore the issue and not do anything about it and we have safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7116)|
| 1:58:42| issues and we have other poll issues and they just ignore the whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| We don't have to issue them a permit to keep on adding more stuff in a system they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| maintain and so that's really the stick, if you will, the ability to say, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| deal with this before you start adding more over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7140)|
| 1:59:06| Whoever can answer this, is there any type of statistic that can be run through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| engine process that identifies the highest percentage per number of polls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7151)|
| 1:59:21| Who's the violator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| There's got to be, because I do believe that AT&T, I believe that most people do try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| work in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| I totally understand that you cannot do anything until the person above you takes care of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7169)|
| 1:59:36| business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7176)|

| 1:59:42| So to answer your question, I would assume, I don't know, I'm not an engine expert by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| no means, but I would assume there are several reports that can be run through the engine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7187)|
| 1:59:52| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| We both have experts on both sides, anybody that does in this business has people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| are very familiar with the system and can run a lot of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| I think that's part of what we can do in these quarterly meetings, that we can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| that and have some more factual data to know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| I do appreciate the photos and that is very evident of some, what I would call, dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| situations there and need to be remedied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| But there's other things we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| So let's start with the real data and let's move forward and let's track our progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| like Aaron showed, what KUB has done, so I think it's a starting point where everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| communicates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| I can tell you that just to delineate the two, Madam Chair, the pole owners are KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7235)|
| 2:00:42| LCUB, AT&T, TDS, and Frontier, all of which may have elements on those poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7242)|
| 2:00:51| The telecom companies that are not pole owners that are attachers also include WOW, Spectrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| and Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| So you've got eight people that could be attaching to a pole but five that actually own poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7257)|
| 2:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| I would be very interested, and I don't know who the appropriate person is to ask, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| Snowden, perhaps you could give some guidance into trying to identify who the biggest violator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7275)|
| 2:01:26| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| And I mean that according to their total percentage of poles, I'm not talking about just the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| kind of thing, because it would—I hate to go after our good neighbors, the people, utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7291)|
| 2:01:42| providers that are doing it right and are trying to do a good job, that it's beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| their control because we've got probably—and I'm just guessing—but probably some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| these much smaller providers that—some of them come and go—that are the violators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7313)|
| 2:02:02| Mr. Snowden, do you have any thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7322)|
| 2:02:08| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| We're kind of new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| We've actually tried to get an account with the engine system because that is more kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| of the utility platform, but we're trying to get into that data and look and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| But right now, Madam Chair, unfortunately, I just wouldn't have a real good answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| Was the original motion to approve this number 29—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| It was to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Thank you, because I have additional questions I want to work on this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| Mr. Jay, did you still—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| Yeah, if I could, that seemed to have gotten through at least most of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7367)|
| 2:02:52| Just a final statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| I would just encourage my commissioners, please read the resolution in whole by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7373)|
| 2:03:00| It will show that we are trying to set up a quarterly partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| It's a statement from us saying we identify this as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| We want to work with all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| In good faith, if you want to be a good actor and a good neighbor, we're going to take your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| We're going to look at it for a year, and we're going to see if we can start addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| the issue, and we're going to come back after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| The ordinance, please read that separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| That is a public safety right-of-way issue that really does say we have an imminent danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| to our society, to our citizens, and we need you to take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7410)|
| 2:03:39| You'll see the language is very much focused on let's address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| There is lots of provisions in there that say if you need extra time, if we deem it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| safe enough for right now, and we'll come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| There's 1,000 provisions that have watered it down to saying we're going to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| you, but you're going to put you on the clock because this is something we do not want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| fall on one of our citizens or to hurt somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7439)|
| 2:04:04| That is very, I would say it's very tame in the terms of a law that enforces things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7444)|
| 2:04:12| Then if that works, great, but if we have a bad actor that doesn't want to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7452)|
| 2:04:18| then we have to have some mechanism to force them to take our safety seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7458)|
| 2:04:24| Please read them in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| I encourage any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| We have a great forum we can use, and I hope we continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| One more quick question, and then I will call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| Is there, outside of immediate danger, are there any other provisions currently written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7480)|
| 2:04:51| where the pole owner can go ahead and detach other providers that are using the pole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7491)|
| 2:05:04| As of now, as I understand it, that's not allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7504)|
| 2:05:11| We sure are not going to touch electric facilities, I can guarantee you that, but as far as them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7511)|
| 2:05:17| moving ours, typically it's either us or our contractor or the other companies, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7517)|
| 2:05:24| attachers or their subcontractor that are supposed to move it because we have working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| customers on those lines, many of which are highly critical, some of those being 9-1-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7528)|
| 2:05:34| public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| So there's service level agreements we have with customers, so we can't just let anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| move our facilities over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| I do want to say just one thing in parting comment was we do want to be part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| Again, we appreciate bringing this to our attention collectively, Commissioner Jay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7550)|
| 2:05:56| Director Snowden, I think it's a worthwhile discussion for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| Many counties have what they call a broadband committee that have worked on getting more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| broadband to other areas, and I'm not sure if Knox County really established that or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| needed to, but what it reminds me of is if we're all working together on issues like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| this, it's a good thing for the county where we cooperate and understand the need for infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7575)|
| 2:06:21| whether it be infrastructure of electricity, sewer water, wastewater treatment, natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| gas or broadband facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| It's highly important we work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| We want to be part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| I feel like the other attachers and other utilities in this region do want to be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| of that solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| We're willing to work with the commission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| We think the resolution is a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| Hold on the utility ordinance per se until after the one year and let the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7604)|

| 2:09:44| I posted on the forum to pull this item, and again, as I stated on the forum, I just was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7784)|
| 2:09:51| curious of what this is, and it outlines a bunch of COVID mitigation, but these seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7791)|
| 2:09:57| to be all capital projects, and so it doesn't quite make sense to me, and I'm also curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| as to why we're funding a capital project for a training tower when we already funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| a regional training facility last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7809)|

| 2:10:20| Commissioner, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| This is a little confusing on the COVID part of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| So this is ARPA funding, and if you all may remember, back in 2021, we brought our ARPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| plan before you, and as part of that plan, there was $2.5 million in grants for nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7830)|
| 2:10:36| organizations, so the Y, Centro, and SEED all fall under that $2.5 million, and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7836)|
| 2:10:45| ARPA works is we can look at the negative economic impacts on these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7845)|
| 2:10:51| so we have that $2.5 million program where nonprofits can apply to the county where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| their revenue was reduced, and then we're able to help them move projects forward that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| they may not have been able to because they lost so much revenue during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| Now, on the fire side, in that same plan, we have $2 million set aside for fire and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| rescue agencies that serve out in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7871)|

| 2:11:24| Their recommendation went to the mayor, and now we are working on the contracts and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7884)|
| 2:11:30| procurement side of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7890)|

| 2:11:37| This project for Karnes happens to be construction-based, so it's going to take a little bit longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| We wanted to go ahead and get that one on as soon as possible, just to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7901)|

| 2:11:55| Let me finish that thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| We had discussed previously in Fire and Technical Rescue about funding a multi-use training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7917)|

| 2:12:09| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7929)|

| 2:12:15| on moving forward with a training facility there at the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| Okay, it helps me understand what it is, and I have some concerns that we're not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7940)|

| 2:12:42| of cooperation, we're using a lot of money to continue to build silos in our emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=7962)|

| 2:13:37| We do have approved, the Fire and Technical Rescue Committee did recommend that we replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8017)|

| 2:13:50| And just to clarify, I do believe I heard you say that this was a recommendation out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| of the Fire and Technical Rescue partnership or committee, which includes, I believe, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8036)|

| 2:14:27| They agreed, a unanimous agreement on forwarding that recommendation on to Mayor Jacobs, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8067)|

| 2:15:22| $2 million, and if you remember, two years ago, we used just a little bit of that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| to fully fund all the agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| Yeah, because we had a cut in their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8131)|

| 2:16:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| Chairman Hilda, my name is Bruce State, my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| My name is Darren Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| And your position, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| My name is Darren Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| I'm the Chief of Carnes Fire Department, Knox County resident, 3224 Meadow Run Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| I guess that's a bigger question for the County Commission also, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| We do work collaboratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| I think one of the biggest things that we've been able to do is put together this Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| and Technical Rescue Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| We meet on an odd schedule sometimes, sometimes it's every month, sometimes it's every two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| I think that we are, we've come closer together, we've built relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8245)|
| 2:17:31| We've been able to define some of the needs across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| But the County Fire Service is not funded by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| We do receive certain funds from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| You know, I answer emails, Commissioner Hill saw an email that I sent to a resident in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| the Carnes community this last week asking about our funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| And I did, out of respect, I paid respect to Knox County for the contributions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| the county is increasing to provide for Fire and Technical Rescue Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| But currently, to be able to train across Knox County, we would have to provide coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| whether it be Carnes' area, rural metro's area, Seymour's area, any of the fire districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| you're going to have to provide back coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| So if we had a training facility that was discussed in East Bridge Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| who's covering Carnes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| Who's covering Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| We've got to backfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| And right now, and currently, that's almost cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| You're talking multiple training centers across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| To be able to still provide those emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| I can also tell you that your ISO rates and most of your homeowner's insurance premiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8306)|
| 2:18:32| that are based from ISO rates, rather, takes into account the training centers, your actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| training centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| Training in the streets, training in the back of the fire station does not count towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| those training centers for ISO points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| And that is also an economic draw to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| I get phone calls from the Knoxville Chamber, excuse me, on ISO rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8331)|
| 2:19:01| They want to know what you can do to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| I can tell you when we dropped from a 7 to a 4 a few years ago, the chamber was ecstatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| because the businesses that are moving into the communities, West Bridge Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8347)|
| 2:19:12| it helps lower their insurance rates and it is a draw to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| So there's multiple benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| It's also firefighter safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| It's training new firefighters and I can tell you that in the past few years it's been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| It's been a big challenge to maintain personnel in many organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| I've talked to fire chiefs across the state and we're having to raise more young firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| up in our fire stations, breed them as our own, versus rely on others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| So I think this is a huge benefit to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| It's the first training center that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| It is a four-story training center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| It is a masonry structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| It provides for technical rescue services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| We're going to put our own dollars into the actual fire piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| You can't burn it inside of these structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| There's NFPA, the National Fire Protection Association rules that govern what you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| So it'll be built under NFPA 1402 standards and alongside it we will put a Class A burn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| box to train firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| Currently we have some neighboring counties, Sevier County is one of them, that sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8411)|
| 2:20:17| they have live fire trainings that we can go certify our firefighters in, but other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| times we're relying on traveling to Nashville or Belle Buckle, Tennessee where the State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| Fire Academy is to train our firefighters and actually certify them in live fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| So I do think this is a great benefit and I appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| Thank you for the detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| I know that it's quite complicated when you get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| Is there no interlocal agreement between the Knoxville Fire Department and any other agency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| Because they do have a tower and a training facility right in the heart of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| They do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8448)|
| 2:20:49| And so in years past, we worked with the City of Knoxville, we worked with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| Fire Department very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| As you know, everyone has their own risk departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| So they don't let you play over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| Well, they extended the offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| We currently do still maintain the MOU with the City of Knoxville, but they wanted full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| subrogation and our attorneys and our insurance company said we cannot provide full subrogation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8467)|
| 2:21:14| So we are not able to train at the City of Knoxville facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| But that's on our side, on our attorneys and our insurance company, not the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| We do appreciate all that they've done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| Any other questions of Commissioner, or Chief Long, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8485)|
| 2:21:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8494)|
| 2:21:35| I'd be amiss if I didn't say this again and hopefully I'll get to say it one more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| in the six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| When this committee started, there was four 800-pound gorillas in there, and now there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8501)|
| 2:21:48| zero gorillas in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| These guys are working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| They work with Jenny, they work with Perry, and they work with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| And I am so tickled and so proud to be on this committee, kind of compares to the Ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8516)|
| 2:22:01| Committee, but it's a great committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| I think it's been wonderful just to see these four units, Brewell, Seymour, Carnes, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8524)|
| 2:22:13| the rescue squad come together as one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| Now they're working as one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| There's no you're going to get this or you're not going to get this or any more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| So Chief Long, I'm proud of the committee, and I think Jenny is doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8543)|
| 2:22:31| We got Mr. Seymour back there who's basically the emergency management leader now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| We got one team member to go to for leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| So things are looking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| It really is in Knox County as far as the fire and rescue goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8561)|
| 2:22:49| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8569)|
