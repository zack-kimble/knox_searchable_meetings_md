| 0:00:48| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=48)|

| 0:01:15| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| We are all here tonight. I want to thank everybody who is here with us and anybody who might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| be watching on TV. Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Any opposed? The ayes have it. The minutes are approved. Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=92)|

| 0:01:45| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| So, for the Mayor's Report, I just want to make sure folks in the community know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=106)|
| 0:01:53| there are less than two weeks before the March 31st deadline for enrolling in a health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| plan under the Affordable Care Act to help our constituents get information about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| affordable health insurance options are available to them and to help them enroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| The City is co-sponsoring an enrollment event this Saturday, March 22nd from 10 a.m. to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| 2 p.m. at the Magnolia Avenue campus at Pellissippi State Community College there at 1610 East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=136)|
| 0:02:23| Magnolia. This is not a political issue or a partisan issue. This is about letting uninsured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| or underinsured people of our city know what is available to them. Having access to affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| health insurance and health care is important for individuals and families across Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| I want to recognize our partners for this event, including Get Covered America, Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| State, and Tenova. There will be trained specialists on hand to help people walk, to help walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| people through the application and the enrollment process. So please help us spread the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| about that. You can find more information about this and other enrollment events that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| are happening throughout our city on the City website at cityofknoxville.org slash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| affordablecareact. And there we do list what you need to bring to the events and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| different events around town. But the one we're co-sponsoring is this Saturday, March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| 22nd from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Magnolia campus of Pellissippi. Next, our annual Employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| Appreciation Luncheon will be held next Tuesday, March 25th at 12 noon in the Coliseum Ballroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=210)|
| 0:03:40| This is our chance to recognize and thank employees who have served the city for 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| years or more and who have retired in the past year. So I know I encourage Council to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| come and to join with me in honoring our employees. And you all know that next week I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| holding the Mayor's Budget Hearings starting on Wednesday, the 26th and going on at different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| times through Friday, the 28th. We will post a full schedule of the hearings on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| on Monday. And as usual, they will be in Room 453 right here in the City-County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| And they are open, of course, to Council members and the public. This is the first chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| hear from department heads about their proposed budget priorities for the 2014-15 year. As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| I said at our budget retreat, I have asked each of them to prepare both a continuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| budget from the current year and an alternative budget showing 6% spending cuts. And I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| be considering all of these options as I work with our staff to draft a proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| which will be presented at the annual budget address on Thursday, April 24th. And finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=283)|
| 0:04:50| we have scheduled our first public meeting to gather public input, ideas and feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| about the redevelopment of the properties that the City owns on West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| Of course, that includes the former site of the McClung Warehouses. That meeting is scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| for Thursday, April 3rd at 5.30 p.m. at the Southern Depot on Depot Avenue. We are planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| to drop a request for proposals from private developers later this year for those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| But before we do that, we wanted to hear from the public about people's priorities, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| hopes and their vision for that area. So this is a very important corridor for the continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| redevelopment of downtown, and we want to attract significant new investment. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| invite everybody to come on down, roll up your sleeves and help us put together an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| that really reflects what Knoxville wants for this site. And that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| Councilman Steyer? Thank you, Mayor. I had two announcements, both very good news. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=348)|
| 0:05:56| is that the Bijou had their annual fundraiser last weekend. It was a sold-out show at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Bijou. It was just a fantastic night and good for the theater. And then two, Mr. Kaps, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=361)|
| 0:06:09| you wanted to come on down, there's an exciting event at the end of the month, and I invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| Ashley Kaps here to talk about it. But it really highlights our two historic theaters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| brings people to downtown, brings people to Knoxville, and creates a lot of press for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| Knoxville. So I asked Mr. Kaps to come and speak about it briefly. Welcome, Mr. Kaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| Give them an address for the record, please. Ashley Kaps, address, let's see, 2250 Hillsboro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| Heights, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920. So thanks for having me. Marshall asked me to come and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=400)|
| 0:06:48| tell you a little bit about our Big Ears Festival, which is coming up a weekend after next, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| the 28th, 29th, and 30th of March. It's coming back after a bit of a hiatus. We first staged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| it in 2009 and 2010. And then we gave it a rest for a variety of reasons. It lost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=422)|
| 0:07:11| We got very involved in other events in other cities. And I guess it was November of 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=431)|
| 0:07:21| we were approached by the Aslan Foundation, the city, and encouraged to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=441)|
| 0:07:29| And through their help, along with the help of the Regal Entertainment Group, Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| there's really so many people to mention. Of course, the CBID. We're back in 2014. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| festival is unusual in that it brings together some of the world's leading composers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| performers from the worlds of classical music, as well as rock music, especially alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| rock, and jazz, folk, and beyond. This year, we have as our special artist in residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=478)|
| 0:08:07| the composer Steve Reich, who is 78 years old this year, and has been declared by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| New York Times as our greatest living composer. He won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=493)|
| 0:08:21| And we will have some of his key works, some for very large ensembles that are being imported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| from New York City, who specialize in his work, performed during the weekend. It's quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| an honor to have him here. But we also have some leading luminaries from the world of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| rock and roll, including three of Rolling Stone's top 100 rock guitarists of all time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| Mark Rebo, Tom Verlaine from television, and Johnny Greenwood from Radiohead. And Johnny's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| actually going to be here also performing one of Steve Reich's pieces that was written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| for guitar, and then he's written some award-winning music for films, like There Will Be Blood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| and The Master, Norwegian Wood. He's just signed on for Paul Thomas Anderson's new film,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| and that music's going to be performed as well. All in all, there's going to be nearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| 50 performances throughout the weekend, mostly at the Tennessee and the Bijou. They'll also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| be at the Scruffy City Music Hall on Market Square, which is a new venue. And there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| some great programs at the Knoxville Museum of Art, many of which will be free to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| public. There's some workshops for children, some films, some great opportunities to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=569)|
| 0:09:37| with some of the artists. And I could keep going on and on here, but one thing I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=577)|
| 0:09:45| want to reflect on for just a minute, back in 2004, as I think everyone in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| undoubtedly knows, Richard Florida wrote a book called The Rise of the Creative Class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| And it's proved to be pretty prophetic in showing how the economic tides in our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=594)|
| 0:10:05| have undergone a fairly dramatic restructuring. And a lot of that focused on the creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| class, people who work in the arts and technology, and a lot of young entrepreneurs. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=613)|
| 0:10:22| class has done a lot to fuel what economic recovery we're seeing at this particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| In fact, the dichotomy between that economic recovery and what's lagging behind is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| of the striking characteristics right now in our country. But the creative class is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| definitely determining the winners and the losers, not only in terms of companies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| economic projects, but also which cities thrive and which cities wither. And I like to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=644)|
| 0:10:54| of this project as being something that really supports the city of Knoxville in positioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| itself as a very attractive and progressive place for the creative class, and therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| for our economic future. So I do hope, I'd like to encourage everybody to come out, check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| it out. The music's not as intimidating as some people think it is. A little bit of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| is, but most of it is extremely enjoyable. You've even heard some of it in the Hunger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| Games. If you were in college in the 70s, surely you had heard television blasting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| of your dorm rooms. And it's mostly just going to be really, really big fun. So I hope you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| come out, meet the 1,000 people that are coming to Knoxville for the event from all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| over the country, from New York, from Chicago, from California, but also from Europe, Japan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| Canada, Mexico, South America, and beyond. It's going to be a fun time. So thanks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Thank you, Ashley, and thank you. This is just another example, Ashley, of what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| continue to do to make Knoxville thrive, and we appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=720)|
| 0:12:08| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=728)|
| 0:12:08| Yes, thank you, Mayor. I want to announce there'll be a public meeting in the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| concerning the urban forests at Williams Creek. And that meeting will be March the 25th at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=734)|

| 0:20:04| We put an estimate of $5,000 for all of the properties. That's about what we average over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| that I've been doing it. It's about $5,000 for legal fees and just cleaning it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| Okay, so that's the expectation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Yes, $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1216)|

| 0:21:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| I see you there. Don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| You were looking down. I wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Jim, could you just give us a nickels worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| I mean, this is the fifth change order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| I know this project has had a lot of struggles in terms of finding things out that you had to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| but the latest increase is more, what, extension of time than physical structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| Jim Hagerman, director of engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| This latest change order has to do with both time because of the KEB projects that were going on parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1316)|
| 0:22:10| We delayed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| They pushed the contract aside for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Additional costs come from a redesign based on the fact that one of the property owners didn't want to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| so we did a redesign in order to work around that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| So there was just some more design time involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| There was also one public meeting beyond what we had contracted for in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| and there was some more traffic control at the request of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| There was some more traffic control work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Do you think we're done now at this point in terms of increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| That kind of depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| We opened bids today, and we only got one bid, and it was too high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| so we have to reevaluate and think about what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1389)|

| 0:24:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Oh, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| I wanted to ask Melissa to come, and I appreciate her speaking to me yesterday about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| but I wanted to ask her again a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| We bought a consultant report, GOVA's report, in September of 2010, September 10th, dated September 10th, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1471)|
| 0:24:42| And in there it said that CAT, one of his recommendations was that they're reporting the spare ratio to be 39% of the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1482)|
| 0:24:51| and that the 20% was more in line of the spare ratio for buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| And I just wanted to ask and wanted her to tell you what she told me to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| so I just want to leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| I'll let you tell me the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Melissa Robertson, Knoxville Area Transit, 301 George Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| Yes, as we discussed yesterday, the spare ratio is a federal requirement that we have no more than 20% spares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1517)|
| 0:25:28| It takes into account when you have a fleet that is changing, and post-UT our fleet was changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1528)|
| 0:25:37| There are also federal requirements related to how old a bus must be before you can replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| It's not like you can say, well, I think I'll get rid of this one and get a new model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| They all have the different types of vehicles have requirements for useful life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| And as our buses meet their useful life, we like to have in place a plan to be able to replace those buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1556)|
| 0:26:05| which that's what these three resolutions, the resolutions that you're considering tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| are actually for the funding to buy replacement vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| But as I explained to Councilman Wallace when we were talking, because we were right-sizing our fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1574)|
| 0:26:22| we have been getting, we will be getting rid of more buses than we will be buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| So, in essence, today we are at 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| And it was a function of right-sizing the fleet post-UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| Thank you. I think that's an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| And that was part of his recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| It was because we kind of got caught in, he looked at it at a time when we hadn't downsized yet off the UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you for speaking with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Councilman Delvoppi, thank you. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Thank you, Mayor. As long as you're here and we have these three resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| on 11J I was looking at the division of the $10 million good repair grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| and it looked like Nashville and Memphis were kicking our butt in terms of getting big grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| or at least recommended for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| What is the difference in terms of their, what, position in that award for the competition compared to Iowa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1630)|
| 0:27:21| This state of good repair program was actually, was in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| And the state of Tennessee put together a statewide application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| It was essentially what vehicles each individual transit system had that were eligible for fleet replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1653)|
| 0:27:43| And, again, this was in 2010, so we were projecting forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| What we will be using these funds for are for less than 30-foot vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| which are the smaller vehicles that we use in neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| because we try to right-size our vehicles like we try to right-size our fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| We use the big buses on the major streets and the smaller buses in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| You don't need a giant bus for just a few passengers. That doesn't make any sense fuel-wise, service-wise, or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| And some of it has to do with the street environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| We do have some neighborhood routes that the passenger demand is there for a larger vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| but we simply can't put a large vehicle in some neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| But these were the vehicles that were needed when we were doing that planning back in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| Just like the resolution tonight for the large buses, as we were discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| these are for vehicles that we will anticipate getting in 2016, so we're planning in out years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| And in terms of competition with other cities, was there anything different about their system than ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| They had some needs that were higher dollar needs for their vehicle replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| There's a lot of different funding sources, as you'll notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| These three resolutions, the reason you have three is because they're three different funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| And Knoxville has been fortunate to use surface transportation program funds through our TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| Some other cities don't have that option, so it kind of depends on what your local situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1750)|

| 0:29:19| I had a question, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Does the population of those cities have anything to do with that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| I'm sure TDOT took that into account when they did their allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| TDOT actually divvied up the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| They were the grantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| But some of it also had to do with the needs that they had in their fleets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1774)|

| 0:31:51| What does it do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| It's an upgrade kit that goes on to our robot that our explosive ordinance team utilizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=1912)|

| 0:34:00| Jim, I was just wondering, this seems a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| Have we picked up the K-Trans separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| I think we had some discussion a while back that we were going to, since we're running both systems in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| that we have K-Trans as part of this excess liability insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| How does that affect our rating in terms of, you know, greater exposure, lesser exposure, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| What we have done as part of the city is we have rolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| CAT was formerly insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| They bought insurance on the open market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| They separately have their own insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| And what we have now done is we have now rolled them into our self-insurance fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| And what this does is just basically provides the excess coverage for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Have we raised the limits of the part we're carrying or eating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| or is it just excess coverage for two entities, the city and CAT, as a separate piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| I think the excess coverage is probably the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| It says we're retaining $600,000 as our own exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Well, again, what excess coverage does, for most people, is we are self-insured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| but we don't want to have an unlimited exposure in the case of claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| And so what we do is we buy coverage that caps our exposure at certain limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| and that's what the excess coverage is for on both CAT and banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2137)|

| 0:38:03| think about that, because it would be a great help for the police and also so they won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| have to lock up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2291)|

| 0:38:19| Because I've talked to a couple people that work for the city, and they're scared to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| death because I know you're going to have to do the budget cuts, but what kind of impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| is that going to have on the citizens of Knoxville if you have the 6% budget cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2309)|

| 0:41:25| And I'm not going to let you people and the rest of us, the rest of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| come in and just let these companies come in and do what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| and don't be responsible for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| My first complaint is with KUB Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| and they laughed at me when I came in front of them to complain about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| explaining to us why our utility bills keep rising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| and they laughed at me after they bought me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| That was embarrassing, and that's why I'm going to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| because when it came time to get on this register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| I called two weeks ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| The lady told me, they don't even have an agenda yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| That's how fast I wanted to be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| So I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2521)|

| 0:42:17| only two employees are at the window at the Western Avenue branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| City police giving tickets for illegal parking only on the first of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| If cops are parking there, if cops are giving tickets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| KUB need to have more employees there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| The bank has tow signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| KUB has no parking spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| That ain't fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Ms. Roach hired a private investigator to watch me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| I'm going to look and see if he's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| He's not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| He told me he would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| This probably is being paid for with the city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Just because I'm complaining to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2578)|

| 0:43:09| but I told him I was going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| and he even told me, please don't bring your sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| I'm going to bring the sign next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| and I'm going to tell somebody, listen to my cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2596)|

| 0:43:25| and bought a $5,000 unit to save energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Instead, I'm losing more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| They said look for the long-term progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| I don't want to look for the long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| I want that to be showed up on my bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| My last month's bill was $68 over than the normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| Yeah, best excuse they used was we had bad days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| but we have some good days also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2624)|

| 0:44:18| They said they gave credit in the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| but they didn't give us a credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| The pool holds 18,000 gallons of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140318?start=2664)|
