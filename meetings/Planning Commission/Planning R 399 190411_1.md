| 2:49:45| now over $3 million into it. And so to have that taken away when that was something we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10185)|
| 2:49:50| hoped sometime down the road could be a possibility, I just want to mention we'd like to possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10190)|
| 2:49:54| leave that open. We've been blocked four times now coming in the property in over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10194)|
| 2:49:59| Three trees across the road, one of them I was out removing myself during a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| one time so our body could get off the property, and another time there was an accident at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| John Sevier that shut down our access for an hour to get in and out of the church. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| my concern was, what if there's an emergency? What if there's a fire? What if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| heart attack and one of these trees is down or there's some accident? It would be nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10214)|
| 2:50:18| to know, and of course our previous request we made to the NPC 15 years ago was that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| be gated, and here's why. We don't want anybody on it. We want it closed and only as an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10224)|
| 2:50:30| access if needed, and something we could use at service times, and I just want to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10230)|
| 2:50:35| my heart on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| Haven't we heard that argument on this piece before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10239)|
| 2:50:39| I thought we had. I think that I'm not going to amend my motion. I think it is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10239)|
| 2:50:49| if the neighbors on Topside have that as a concern, and it pertains to this improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10249)|
| 2:50:55| right now. Yes, you can come back at a later time, show that you need that, and we'll talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10255)|
| 2:51:00| with the neighborhood at some point if you want to go to the neighborhood and say we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| really kind of need to be able to come out on Topside because we've got 5,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10264)|
| 2:51:09| in our church. You can still do it. It's not going to be easy and it shouldn't be, so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10269)|
| 2:51:15| not going to amend my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| We have a motion on the floor. I do not see any other lights on. Made by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| Clancy, seconded by Commissioner Graf to approve per staff recommendation with an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10284)|
| 2:51:30| condition that access be limited to John Sevier Highway. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10290)|
| 2:51:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10297)|
| 2:51:37| For this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| For this plan. That's what you're approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| That's all I'm voting on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10301)|
| 2:51:44| Okay. So, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10304)|
| 2:51:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10311)|
| 2:51:52| Got a couple nos. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10312)|
| 2:51:58| Next on the agenda is item number 50, and we are going to pause for just a moment while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10318)|
| 2:52:05| we lose our audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10325)|
| 2:52:14| I'm in this one going out that way every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10334)|
| 2:52:22| At some point, they can come to me and say, we really need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10342)|
| 2:52:28| Okay. It's hard to trust all these people. It's a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10348)|
| 2:52:33| That's what I was wondering about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10353)|
| 2:52:48| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10368)|
| 2:52:49| We do have one more. Item number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10369)|
| 2:52:54| And I see one person, no, a couple people in the audience. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10374)|
| 2:53:00| Two attorneys, they don't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10380)|
| 2:53:03| And Mr. Jernigan there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| This is a use on review. The applicant is Isaac Pennell, Reagan Design and Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10386)|
| 2:53:13| Location is the corner of North Central Street, Bearden Place, and Stewart Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10393)|
| 2:53:19| Approximate size of the tract is 2,821 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10399)|
| 2:53:26| Zoning is G3 general commercial. Existing land use is commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10406)|
| 2:53:32| Proposed use is two residential units on the second floor in a C3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10412)|
| 2:53:38| The staff recommendation is to postpone the use on review until May 9th meeting as recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10418)|
| 2:53:46| But the applicant is requesting approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| I imagine you're the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| So you would like to speak to the staff's recommendation, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10436)|
| 2:53:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10439)|
| 2:54:00| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10440)|
| 2:54:01| It's Isaac Pennell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10441)|
| 2:54:02| I'm a general contractor with Reagan Design and Construction, address 2516 Maple Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10442)|
| 2:54:07| And what we're trying to do here is, this is actually a pre-existing historical building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10447)|
| 2:54:13| where we've renovated the first floor to a commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10453)|
| 2:54:16| And the original historical atmosphere of this building was two residential apartments or condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10456)|
| 2:54:22| with living spaces upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10462)|
| 2:54:23| And we actually went ahead and renovated the bottom floor to be commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| put in necessary handicapped accessibility into that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10466)|
| 2:54:30| And when we pulled the permit for this, we got approved for a commercial use upstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| where we would have basically three tenants that would be commercial, all commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| We got in, we got approved from the city to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| We got started with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| I met on site with some building inspectors and had some questions about the ADA regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10483)|
| 2:54:48| If you can imagine a historical building with only a staircase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10488)|
| 2:54:51| there's pretty much no actual handicapped accessibility upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| And I started to say, well, why are we pursuing a commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| when we would like to restore it to original historic use and put apartments upstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| We feel like that fits well because there's other residential properties in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| There's also a great use there for the food truck park that just went in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| and other businesses there for residential use in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| I know that in future plans review, I think it's going to be almost going to be a C2 or CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10514)|
| 2:55:19| as the future is proposing it would be, which would allow it to be residential also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10519)|
| 2:55:23| So we're just asking for mainly clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10523)|
| 2:55:26| We got into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10526)|
| 2:55:27| We would like to use it residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| We're obviously open to it being commercial, but we prefer it to be residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10530)|
| 2:55:35| and think it would fit better with this area for it to be a residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| And I'm understanding, if I'm understanding correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| it is the parking that is perhaps an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10546)|
| 2:55:47| So one of the considerations when I originally started this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| was to go ahead and see if we could rezone it to C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| where it would be a downtown zoning to where it would fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| where the parking would not be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| And I was advised to go to the use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| and they said if we could find tentative parking agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| with a couple of the businesses around the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| then that would be favorable towards us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| So I went ahead and contacted several of the local businesses around that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10567)|
| 2:56:10| We actually had four businesses agree to tentative agreements that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| if you go through and all is okay, then you can park at any one of our spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10573)|
| 2:56:17| and that's fine with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10577)|
| 2:56:18| So we did get tentative parking, and one of the things I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| Mr. Reynolds can speak more to this was the allowance for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| handicap accessibility and those kind of regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| with it being a residential space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| And I think Mr. Reynolds can speak more to this also is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| there was limitations for it not being a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| and actually having three occupancies with the commercial on the first floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| and needing off-site handicap parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| So that was what I think the staff's review was to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| And we are just saying, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| We want to make the space usable, so we're mainly just seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| counsel from y'all of how can we actually move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| and use this space as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| We obviously have zero opportunities to put parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| on the property because we are completely landlocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| by the property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| So we want to help out, we want to make the space usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| It's been sitting there for who knows how many hundreds of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| and been vacant pretty much for 20, 30, 40, 50 years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| So you have already got agreements from these four businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10635)|
| 2:57:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10638)|
| 2:57:19| They have all been tentative at this point because we just don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| to lock ourselves into a permanent agreement without actually being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10641)|
| 2:57:24| to use the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10644)|
| 2:57:25| If it's going to be commercial, we're not required to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| any parking whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10647)|
| 2:57:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| Mr. Reynolds, do you have anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10649)|
| 2:57:32| So there are two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10652)|
| 2:57:34| Obviously you mentioned rezoning to C2, which wouldn't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10654)|
| 2:57:37| any parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10657)|
| 2:57:38| I guess there's technically three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10658)|
| 2:57:42| You already went down the BZA variance route and you withdrew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10662)|
| 2:57:46| that application according to the records for the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10666)|
| 2:57:51| And then the other option is to go through use and review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| which we're doing today, and find the parking stalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10673)|
| 2:57:58| that are required for the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| And in talking with the codes department, there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| four parking stalls that would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| Since it's four parking stalls, the zoning ordinance does require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| one ADA space, even though the building code wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10691)|
| 2:58:15| So at least one of those spaces has to be accessible from the space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| where they are to the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10699)|
| 2:58:22| And then once they get to their building, then they're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10702)|
| 2:58:25| I mean, really the public right-of-way is considered accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| The other spaces would also have to meet parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| So if there was off-site parking that had to be upgraded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10713)|
| 2:58:39| like say to be surfaced, like asphalt surfaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| they would be potentially doing that at their own cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10723)|
| 2:58:46| on someone else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| So there's just a lot that's involved in regard to the off-site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| parking and whether or not it's going to be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| to meet the zoning requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| And I think staff is what we're trying to make sure is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| we don't put the plans review staff in a bind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10742)|
| 2:59:07| if we're approving something where it potentially can't be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10747)|
| 2:59:12| through them after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10752)|
| 2:59:14| And so we want a little more comfort that they can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| make the spaces work where they are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10757)|
| 2:59:21| Okay. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| I want to make sure that I understand what our options are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10766)|
| 2:59:30| because in C-3, use-on-review is required for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10770)|
| 2:59:35| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10777)|
| 2:59:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10778)|
| 2:59:39| So I think one option is to approve the use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10779)|
| 2:59:44| subject to the parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10787)|
| 2:59:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10788)|
| 2:59:49| That may, you know, in listening to Mr. Pinnell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| it seems like a chicken and egg or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10792)|
| 2:59:57| He doesn't want to enter into a final agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| until he has some sense of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| I would tell you that C-2 is probably the easiest route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10802)|
| 3:00:07| but I think it's unreasonable to not allow someone to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10807)|
| 3:00:11| their building when they have absolutely zero parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| Now, I think you step in when a main event comes to a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10813)|
| 3:00:17| like his and you've got hundreds of people being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| but we're talking about a couple of vehicles, a low impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10820)|
| 3:00:24| But nonetheless, I think he's going to be satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| if we make a motion to approve this residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10827)|
| 3:00:31| under the use-on-review subject to the parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10831)|
| 3:00:36| by the city codes officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10836)|
| 3:00:38| Can I make that informal motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| Are you making that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10840)|
| 3:00:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10841)|
| 3:00:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10842)|
| 3:00:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10843)|
| 3:00:44| And I have a question regarding the handicap accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| Considering we have no handicap usage in the entire space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10847)|
| 3:00:52| if there's a way that we could just have off-site parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10852)|
| 3:00:56| that would allow to that without having a handicap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| unaccessible space with handicap-mandated parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10859)|
| 3:01:02| I believe what you're going to find is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| Could I add that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10864)|
| 3:01:05| I'm sorry, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10865)|
| 3:01:06| Could I add that to the motion that we waive the ADA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10866)|
| 3:01:10| I don't think that that's in our purveyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| We don't have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| It's a requirement of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10876)|
| 3:01:17| He could go to the ADA for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| But we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10880)|
| 3:01:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10883)|
| 3:01:24| You've got my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10884)|
| 3:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10886)|
| 3:01:27| I got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10887)|
| 3:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10888)|
| 3:01:29| I have a motion to approve...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10889)|
| 3:01:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10893)|
| 3:01:34| What we're doing is approving the use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10894)|
| 3:01:40| and there is subject to parking availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10900)|
| 3:01:46| Residential use subject to the parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10906)|
| 3:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| And that was seconded by Commissioner Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| who had his light on, turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| My question was, can we condition a use-on-review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| And I think we can, but I wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10921)|
| 3:02:04| And it would be subject to the one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| that they meet the parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10930)|
| 3:02:11| Offsite parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10931)|
| 3:02:12| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10932)|
| 3:02:15| If the codes department doesn't require the accessible parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| but the zoning does require the accessible parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10939)|
| 3:02:24| does zoning take preference over...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| Zoning would take precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| And I remember the argument when the parking ordinance was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10948)|
| 3:02:35| that the, amazingly enough, building...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10955)|
| 3:02:40| Well, the codes administration wanted the ADA requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10960)|
| 3:02:44| in the parking ordinance as well as in the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| And I think we are addressing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| in the updated zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| I would just defer to the building code requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10971)|
| 3:02:55| for ADA parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10975)|
| 3:02:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10977)|
| 3:02:58| You're saying with re-code, then there would not be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10978)|
| 3:03:02| Would not be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10982)|
| 3:03:03| So, in a few months, this won't be a problem for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10983)|
| 3:03:08| Hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10988)|
| 3:03:09| But I guess my point is, in a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10989)|
| 3:03:12| he won't be required to have the accessible spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10992)|
| 3:03:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10995)|
| 3:03:16| And also, with the zoning that's proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| there's a re-code, a 30% reduction in off-street parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| if you're within a quarter mile of a transit line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| So he would be immediately reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11006)|
| 3:03:28| from four required spaces to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11012)|
| 3:03:33| So call your council rep and tell them to adopt re-code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11013)|
| 3:03:36| Vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11016)|
| 3:03:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11017)|
| 3:03:38| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11018)|
| 3:03:39| I think, even, I'm just reading in our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| what staff wrote here, it says the only other option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| it was denied by BZA, of course, before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| but the only other option for meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| the minimum parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| for him to lease space off the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11032)|
| 3:03:54| which it seems like he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| So if we do what we're talking about doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| I think we'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11038)|
| 3:03:59| Well, he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11039)|
| 3:04:00| Well, he's not done it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11040)|
| 3:04:02| Yes, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11042)|
| 3:04:03| It's tentative, based on our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11045)|
| 3:04:06| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11046)|
| 3:04:07| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11047)|
| 3:04:09| Mr. Pinnell, is in your residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| going to be upstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11052)|
| 3:04:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11053)|
| 3:04:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11054)|
| 3:04:15| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11055)|
| 3:04:16| So why does he need ADA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| Is it for the commercial or for the residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| No, it's the way the ADA standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| are written there based on the number of spaces you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11064)|
| 3:04:28| And, you know, I didn't write them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11070)|
| 3:04:31| No, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11071)|
| 3:04:32| It just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11072)|
| 3:04:33| It's based on the number of spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| You have to have a certain number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| of accessible spaces for every non-accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11077)|
| 3:04:40| or for so many non-accessible spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| you have to have an accessible space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| regardless of whether the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| for which the parking is provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| is accessible, the spaces have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| And you're having two units up there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11093)|
| 3:04:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11094)|
| 3:04:55| And I think that's some of our confusion as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| is we have plans that show ADA bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| with doorways leading into those bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| that are not ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| And we have to apply, we have to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| all of the plumbing upstairs to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| with bathrooms that have been stamped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| by the City Plans Review, and we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| a doorway that's ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| But yet we have stairs getting upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| but we don't have doorways to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| the handicapped chairs through the doorway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| So I think for us, it's just, we're happy to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| however we need to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11122)|
| 3:05:23| We would just like, we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11123)|
| 3:05:26| that no ADA person will ever go into the upstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11126)|
| 3:05:29| because it's physically impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| to get upstairs in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| We couldn't build an elevator because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| there's no space for an elevator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| We would like to help out in whatever way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| Not all people that need accessible bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11139)|
| 3:05:42| are requiring wheelchair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11144)|
| 3:05:45| But anyway, we do have a motion on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11145)|
| 3:05:48| and a second, it was a motion by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11148)|
| 3:05:52| second by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| to approve this Eason Review subject to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11154)|
| 3:05:57| and subject to getting parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11161)|
| 3:06:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11162)|
| 3:06:04| Motion carries, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11166)|
| 3:06:10| I don't think we need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11170)|
| 3:06:12| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11172)|
| 3:06:14| Goodness gracious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11174)|
| 3:06:21| Maybe for Robert's Rules we have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| It's not just a line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11184)|
| 3:06:28| All in favor of adjourning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11188)|
| 3:06:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11189)|
| 3:06:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11190)|
| 3:06:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=11191)|
