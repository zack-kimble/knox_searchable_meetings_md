| 0:00:59| I'd like to take a moment to introduce the law director, Mr. Buch, as well as the vice chair, Mr. Richie Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=59)|
| 0:01:06| And at this time, have the law director say the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=70)|
| 0:01:26| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=86)|
| 0:01:39| Thank you, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Just a quick rundown for my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| Tonight we have one application, but I've been approached by Metro Drug Coalition to grant them a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=102)|
| 0:01:51| So I'm going to give them about five to ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Ms. Ashton from the Metro Drug to come and give us a brief presentation before we dive a little deeper into the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=114)|
| 0:02:01| Hi. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| Could you state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| My name's Ashton Casey, A-S-H-E-T-O-N-C-A-S-E-Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| I just wanted to inform you all that I've heard at both the County Beer Board and the City Beer Board a few references to the DVD resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| through Metro Drug Coalition for folks who have had compliance issues or who are trying to retrain or get their initial training in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=142)|
| 0:02:30| And I talked with Karen Pershing, our executive director, because I'm relatively new to Metro Drug Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=150)|
| 0:02:38| so I wanted to confirm with her before I spoke with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| But we are no longer distributing those DVDs because they no longer make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| So they have all of their resources and class information on their website, and that's top shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=166)|
| 0:02:55| And we still do provide the packets that people have at the start of their application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| and we're still here to help support them if they have compliance issues or whatever that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| if they need resource connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| So we're still here as a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| We can still help people get into top shelf, but we just don't give out those actual DVDs anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| So just for future reference, I'll still be here at all the Beer Board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| so feel free to point people my way if they have questions or need resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| We're happy to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| But I just wanted to officially let everybody know that we don't have those DVDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| But we can still refer people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| We've got Kim Pouncey at Top Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| She's been a partner with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| So we're happy to connect people to resources as they need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| Does anybody have questions about that or concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| I just wanted to let you all know for future reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Moving on to the agenda, we're going to be looking for approval of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| We have first by Commissioner Bussler and a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Next, we're going to move on to Director Boot to swear in those who are going to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| Everybody who's going to testify today, please stand and raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| Thank you, Director Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=268)|
| 0:04:42| Before we get into the next application, several of us have received an email that pertains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| to this application about beer sales being on premises and consumption within 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| of any school or church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| At this time, I would kind of like to turn it over to Director Boot to maybe clear the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| air on some of the things that are tied up in those sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| Director Boot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| The way the state law is written, there are liquor licenses which are strictly in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| province of the state alcoholic beverage commission and beer licenses and permits which are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| the province of the county commissions of each county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| The law states that if you've got a liquor permit, then any restrictions on distances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| from churches and schools do not apply for somebody getting a beer permit if they already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| have or they do get a liquor permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| So 300 foot restriction that is under our law, under our ordinance, does not apply if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=340)|
| 0:05:49| somebody comes before this beer board and has a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| Thank you, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| I'm going to turn to the clerk to look for applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| It's point B, 1020 Ebenezer Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922, on premises, District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=363)|

| 0:06:19| Director Boot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| Would you state your name for the commission, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=382)|

| 0:06:48| And is the information on the application current and accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Do you understand you shall make no sales whatsoever to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| No, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=417)|

| 0:07:20| So there's no outstanding license that you know of right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=440)|

| 0:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=447)|

| 0:10:44| Director Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=644)|

| 0:10:53| is within 300 feet of a church or a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=653)|

| 0:23:40| We're moving into the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| November is always good for a good house fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| resulting from someone trying to deep-fry a turkey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| usually too close to their house, and thus burning it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1429)|

| 0:24:07| so we encourage that all our neighbors be careful around the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| This time of year always brings the highest number of house fires for today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| and with that also brings the highest number of injuries, deaths, and property losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| We would much rather that our neighbors just invite us over for dinners and parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| rather than have to meet on those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| And I'll answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1470)|

| 0:28:03| Item number 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Spread of record of the employee handbook for the Knox County Property Assessor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| We'll move on then to item 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Approving the execution of an interlocal project agreement, multi-use stadium project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1698)|

| 0:28:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Jay with a second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Mr. Bass, could you please come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1737)|
| 0:29:07| Mr. Bass, whenever I saw the resumes for those that were applying to be on the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| I was very happy to see yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| For us to have someone with your knowledge and understanding to help us through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| process is a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| How many times have you been involved in something like this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| Do you look to guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Municipal financing is hundreds, maybe a thousand over about 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| I worked in the municipal finance area in banking for my whole career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| Could you name some of the projects that involve stadiums and sports complex that you work with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| Certainly two of the most known are probably Camden Yards, which is home of Baltimore Orioles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| and M&T Bank Stadium, which is where the Baltimore Ravens play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Additionally, we did projects for Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen, the Harrisburg Stadium, Buffalo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| New York, several projects in Towson, Maryland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| They were actually university financings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| It was conduits, but it was four stadiums that they were building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| We did a single-aid team, I believe, outside of Philadelphia, but probably a dozen sports-related venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1811)|
| 0:30:22| In all that experience, the process that's happening here in Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| is it a very familiar thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| It's very typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| You always have people with a lot of questions, a lot of interest in what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| They will come to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| They will voice their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| I think that's a very healthy thing, but it's very normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| The creation of the documents takes a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| There are a number of parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| I've been in transactions much larger than this and many more entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| It may take months to get all the documents together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| As the process builds, as you get closer to the actual closing date, you're going to have more parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| You're going to have an indentured trustee, the rating agencies, and the ultimate investor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| There's going to be some entity that's going to be asked to write a check for $75 or $80 million to deposit with a trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| That entity is going to have a lot of questions about documents and things like that and their own input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| It's a process that builds over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| I guess I'll go out on a little bit of a limb here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| In this process, I've said all along, we're very lucky to have Randy Boyd as the catalyst behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1890)|
| 0:31:37| How often do you find team owners and ventures that are willing to participate and give as much as he has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1897)|
| 0:31:46| Not in my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| I was involved with the Baltimore Orioles Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| That was all state and city money that bought the ground and constructed the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| They had a lease from the Orioles, but the owner of the Orioles at that time did not get near as involved as I've seen Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| The same was true of the Ravens and other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| We're very fortunate you moved back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| I'm happy to be back in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Sir, for the clerk's record, would you mind stating your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Richard Bass, and I'm a resident of downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Does any commissioner have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| Because I would like to go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| Okay, it's on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| I really want to explain why I'm voting yes for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| This is a difficult decision with me being the black commissioner, and East Knoxville is home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1966)|
| 0:32:56| and I always talk about poverty rates and all the things that could happen with a stadium being built as far as a potential displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1976)|
| 0:33:09| I struggled with this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1989)|

| 0:33:19| I think this is a great opportunity for our city and our county to do something right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| This is the opportunity for us to build something together, regardless of your race, your belief system, your wealth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2006)|
| 0:33:34| that we can create something through a lens of equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2014)|

| 0:33:46| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| But it's just one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| It's pros and cons to everything, and we're not going to always get what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2029)|

| 0:34:04| And what I want to see from this stadium is black wealth created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| I'm going to go ahead and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| I want three multimillionaires coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| If somebody says it's impossible, I'm not going to believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| We need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| We need to see black multimillionaires in Knoxville who can give back to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2060)|
| 0:34:29| With any project, is it going to have positive impacts all down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Anything always has a negative implication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| But I do want to remind my community there are several black-owned businesses and entrepreneurs who are willing to fill in that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2078)|
| 0:34:48| One of them is my own business, The Women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| We have raised plenty of money to help startup businesses in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| and we plan on doing our job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2097)|

| 0:35:18| I'm excited about Jackie's dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2118)|

| 0:35:37| So my struggle is how can I deny those opportunities for people because there's other people mad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| When I was running for office, one of my campaign managers said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| Daysha, there will always be poor among you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| You can't be stressing over the poor all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| But I know one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2154)|

| 0:43:03| I was told we needed to bring the council up to date from 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| In my view, this ordinance will push the council back 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| This will make the officers vulnerable to be fired at will if they support any sheriff's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| The reason the Merritt Council exists is to protect our men and women from the very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| I would like to share how we found out about this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Mrs. Taylor was the one that noticed we were back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| We did not receive a phone call or meeting with our legal counsel, who is also counsel in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| That is a huge issue as I find conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| I had to reach out to Mr. Myers and he told me he didn't know anything about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| He would find out and call me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| After five minutes, he called me back to tell me that it looks like it's flipping a switch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| to correct the filing of the Merritt Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| I asked when he received the ordinance to please call me back and let me know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| That was last Wednesday and I haven't spoken to him since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| If the Merritt Council is supposed to have legal representation, then that is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| In my opinion, we will need to be allowed outside counsel for grievances and ordinance changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| The ordinance change by Mr. Boot didn't come out until last Thursday at 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| I'm not sure how we as counsel are supposed to digest legal jargon in a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| When changes like these set to put our officers' livelihood at risk, that is a huge concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| I would like to share the ordinance changes have been reviewed in 1990, 91, 94, 95, 2019, 2020, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2672)|
| 0:44:46| I guess my question is how during all of those times and all of those years was this not found?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| We are 16 days away from our first grievance hearing and here we are dealing with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| I do find that suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| I would like to also state for the record that this year, 2021, 96 correction officers have resigned, 27 patrol officers have resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2700)|
| 0:45:10| These numbers do not include retirement, death, or termination, just resignations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| I would think we should be here dealing with these issues instead of trying to take more protection away from our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| The Merritt Council exists solely to protect these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Let me also state it was mentioned last week that the Merritt Council told the sheriff we had to give an employee her car back and gas card, and that is not factual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| We agreed to a hearing, but it is in Chancery Court currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| We have not had a hearing, nor have we told the sheriff to give her her car back or her gas card, and she does not have either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| Moving the Merritt Council back 50 years is nothing political, and it removes all protection from our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| As you have heard, we are down a lot of officers, so adding more hours, work onto them, and now hearing rumors of them not being protected can't be good for morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2752)|
| 0:46:02| The phase back the blue doesn't mean anything if we aren't willing to stand with them and protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| I will close by saying I intend to stand and fight for the protection of these officers of Knox County that put on a uniform to protect me, my family, my community, and you every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2769)|
| 0:46:22| I hope I can count on all you commissioners to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| I'm asking that you vote no on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| I would like my staff to be able to get back to the job that they are charged to do by taking care of the officers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2788)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you, Ms. Oster. Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Ms. Oster, before you step down, so you just mentioned a grievance that is in process, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| Yes, December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| Okay, so the first one, is that the one that's referencing the vehicle and the gas car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| No, that's in Chancery Court, and it has not, decisions not been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| Merritt Council has not had anything to make any decisions on that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| So it has not, the grievance process with Merritt Council has not begun for that particular employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| But there is one on December 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| There is, December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| I do have a couple of questions for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| I noticed in this resolution, or excuse me, this ordinance, that it references PCA 8-20-109.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2848)|
| 0:47:37| So Chapter 20 deals with deputies and the, well it also talks about the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| it talks about the sheriff's office and their ability to appoint deputies and their assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| So Chapter 20 of PCA has nothing to do with Chapter 8 of PCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| which is all about creating and establishing Merritt System, Merritt System rules and how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| So I just was curious how this plays into the ordinance of dealing with the Merritt System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2881)|
| 0:48:10| Let me look at that and I'll try to answer that as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| But the overall change here, I take issue with what Ms. Oakley said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| If she had read the Sheriff's Merritt System Act of 1974, the state act which we're trying to enact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2900)|
| 0:48:30| if she had read that, she would know that these officers are not losing any protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| not one ounce of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| So I take issue with that statement that that would put them at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| Number two, when I said that the Merritt Council had approved to go ahead with a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| on giving Ms. Dooley a car, a newer car, a lower mileage car and a gas car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2930)|
| 0:49:00| it was because the law director's office had told the Merritt Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| under the law, under the Fowler case, couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| You just couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| But they decided to go ahead and have the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| which to me was an indication that they said that they had the authority to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| and they were going to go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| That's what that was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| And that is correct now that outside counsel representing the Sheriff has filed a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2965)|
| 0:49:34| raising that issue and other issues, other very substantial issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| As to the December 1 hearing, as I understand it, I'm not involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| That's outside counsel representing the Sheriff in that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| The attorney, the attorney for the complainant that sat on December 1 sent a letter to the Merritt Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2990)|
| 0:49:58| saying, I can't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| I've got a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Will you reset this until the first of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| So you're not getting a complete story here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| It was set, and I guess it's still on unless the Merritt Council denies the request of the officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| to extend the hearing because he can't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| So those are more of the details that I need to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Now, if you'll give me a minute, I'll look you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Can I respond to that, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| I actually don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| I did not get an email about the attorney asking to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| To change it to the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| I haven't received an email at the attorney asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| Ms. Oster, I need to acknowledge Commissioner Daley. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| I don't think she has a floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And unless you recognize her, she did not speak yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| Well, I'll be glad to recognize her to answer the question Mr. Book raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| Commissioner Durant, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| It's page three of the ordinance that I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| I'm sorry. Say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| It's page three of the ordinance that I was talking about where it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| whereas at common law, all employees of the sheriff are at will employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| And then it references 8-20-109, removal of deputies and assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| Any and all deputies and assistants in any of these offices covered by this chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| shall be removable by the officer for whom they are acting at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| As I stated, this is from Chapter 20 of the Tennessee Code Annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| It is under Title VIII, but it is not under Chapter VIII,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| which is where merit system is established and the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| and all the parameters are for a merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| In my interpretation of the code of Chapter 8-8-401-419| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3106)|
| 0:51:56| and in our current ordinances for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| which are Chapter 42-51-66,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| there is nothing that says the sheriff can remove any officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| My interpretation is it just allows for said officer who is being removed to file a grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| The answer is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| The reason that is in there is because right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| if you don't bring the merit counsel system into compliance with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| there is no merit counsel protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| And if there is no merit counsel protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| the sheriff has absolute authority under that statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| that you just read to hire and fire at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| That's what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| We're just trying to bring everything into compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| That's all there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| If you don't want to, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| The court will worry about it and it will cost a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Another question is for 8-8-408 that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| the sheriff shall appoint a personnel officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| who shall serve as a secretary of the civil service board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| Currently, Ms. Taylor is the said secretary of our merit system counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| She may serve in that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| but her position is executive director created under the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| That's her position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| She will keep that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| She will keep the executive director position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| But she is also the one who is completing the minutes and acting as secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| I don't know what she's doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| She's taking the minutes, but taking the minutes is no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| You just report it, send it off to the next meeting for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| But her main job as executive director, she does it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| She does it exceedingly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| She was created under the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| If you adopt the public act or the state law of 74,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| in this ordinance, everybody keeps their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| Commission comes in and just adopts the rules they already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| and nothing changes except you're now in compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| My question for that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| would grievances be filed through the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| or through the secretary of the Merit System Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| They come the same way they come right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| They're sent to Paula as executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| But Paula also acts as the current secretary of the Merit System Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| according to Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| She takes the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| She is executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| She does a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| That will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| So I have it, your word, that all grievances would come to Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| They all go to the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| She's the one that gets those documents and sends them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3307)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you, Commissioner Dirick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| My understanding, Mr. Booth, help me if I'm wrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| what was put before us right now is to correct a past problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| that was failed to be correct some years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| It creates a Merit System Council which does not now exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Does this change any of the Merit Council at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| at what they're doing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| If we do not pass this on and put it under our statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| or under our rule, the court will rule on it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| And the court can do anything that they want to with it then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| and we have no control over it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| And my worry is that the court looks at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| and does what it did in the Jordan case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| and says that with regard to everything now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| that the Merit Council and County Commission knew about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| everything in there could be said to be void between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| If we do that now, if we set this in motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| we still have the Merit Council we have right now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| The judge cannot overrule that, can he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| It would take it away from the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| because you would have validly passed the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| The state doesn't allow commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| to create their own Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| It says if you want a Merit Council by two-thirds vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| you've got to adopt the Act of 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| So if the judge, if we don't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| and then the judge rules on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| we don't know what we're going to get, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| I'm glad Commissioner Bussler asked if anything changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| because I had a couple questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| I read the Civil Service Law 74, what was sent as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| and TCA Code 8-8-407 states the compensation of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| which means that there's an opportunity for paid positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| if we see it fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| And my understanding is as of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| it's a volunteer position as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| I looked at 8-8-408, and it says chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| and it says that the mayor, our county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| would actually be the one that actually gets to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| the chair of the Merit Council in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| And then I looked at 409 in Duties and Powers, Section 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| and one of the things that stuck out to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| and I'm not saying I don't want the Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| to have all this power, but what I am saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| it kind of alarmed me just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| it does give them a lot more power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| 409, Section 9, says that they'd be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| determine all fringe benefits to employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| coming under the provision of this part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| but there's no definition of what fringe benefits means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| So that means that if I worked for the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| and I drove a car, they could take my car away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| the Merit Council would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| So I kind of dove into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| and if that's now because nothing changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| then maybe we need to start doing a deeper dive into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| because just those three things right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| is what's listed in the paperwork that we were given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| to the Commission a week and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| So those are some major concerns for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| The present ordinance, which was passed back in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| provides the same thing about the Merit Council Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| or members of the Council can be paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| except the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| So that's no change, that's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| In 409, the powers that are in 409,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3551)|
| 0:59:20| they're no different than they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| There is no definition of fringe benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| in the present code, none whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| All we have is what the Court of Appeals has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| that a car is not salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| and taking away a car is not a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| to give for a Merit Council to award anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| to somebody who's had their car taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| That was told to the Merit Council way back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| way back before the lawsuit was even filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| So fringe benefits are not, in any way, are not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| So in the state statute or in the present statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| As it sits now, can us as a legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| define what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| No, we're under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| The only way you can have a Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| is if you comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| State law takes precedence over everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| And if they say you can do it, you can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| but you cannot modify state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| And that's another problem with this private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| Originally, it was a private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| You cannot modify, Commission can't modify a private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| Yet, there were three or four times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| as pointed out, I think, by Ms. Oster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| where Commission came in and did modify what's a private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| You can't modify a private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| that was passed by the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| unless it gave you power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Those are other reasons why this private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| isn't valid today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| And that issue has been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| The seeds of it are right there in the present lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| There's going to probably be another lawsuit filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| with the most recent person who was transferred laterally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| but had no loss of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| But still, the Merit Council, in spite of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| in spite of its own rules, has decided to hear that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| at the great expense of the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| Mr. Chairman, can I ask a question on this subject matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| to Director Booth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| What was the language of that private act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| Well, it was long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| It essentially, when the state act was passed in 1974,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| it virtually mirrored the private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| But the private act that we have has been modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| by County Commission over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| But virtually read the same as the private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| I could go through and send you all something to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| I think one of the things was that it said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| that the council members, as appointed by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| would choose their own chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| And the act of 1974 said the mayor would pick the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| That's probably the major one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| I want to recognize Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Did you have a follow-up to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| I'd like to sort of hear the continuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| before I ask my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| Yeah, I was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| clerical, technical questions, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| In 1990, when we adopted the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| you're saying that we chose not to continue the private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| Where is the language that says we no longer wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| to keep the private act of 1970?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| The ordinance, there was an ordinance passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| that repealed every one of the private, not every one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| but there was a list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| if you go in front of the black book of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| a list of the private acts which are, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| repealed by this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| The Merit Council ordinance, private act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| was at that point repealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| The state law said, and this is where it gets complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| and the judge will ultimately decide if this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| doesn't decide to remedy it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| said that all private acts would be part of a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| if the charter was passed by the voters of a particular county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| that chose to go by a charter government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| And that would have been fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| But the problem was, at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| instead of letting that ride on through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| which would still be okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| the county commission decided to rescind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| And they repealed that private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| They then adopted a private act which was different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| not a private act, they adopted an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| which was different than the private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| and have since modified that from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| So that's basically the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| Commissioner Joe, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Director Book, one of the questions that was posed was sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| how did this just come to light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| And that was a question I asked earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| sort of how are we just now dealing with this or understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| if we're out of compliance with state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| Well, as I pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| this is the proof of the law of unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| and many of you probably don't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| that it happened with the whole county charter back in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| After we'd had a charter for 16 years operating under it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| two constitutional officers filed a suit up in Chantry Court saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| the term limits that you just adopted shouldn't apply to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| That was the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| It wasn't a question of validity of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| And by the time the chancellor got through doing what the chancellor should do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| and always does and evaluate from day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| he came up and he said, whoa, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| you don't even have a valid government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| You don't have a charter that's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| And he ordered that Knox County, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| he ordered Knox County to collect that within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| That went up to the Supreme Court of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| The Supreme Court agreed with Chancellor Weaver and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| you do not have a valid charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Why did it take 16 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Because something came up that caused the court to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| That's the same thing that has happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Nobody looked at it, thought much about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| until a lawsuit was filed based on the Dooley case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3968)|
| 1:06:17| which is where the woman was wanting a car and a gas car, a new car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| because the sheriff had said, you don't need a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| You're not part of your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| That's what triggered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| And once everybody, including the attorneys that were representing the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| in that case, started looking at it, as well as our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| it became apparent at that point, whoa, the same way the chancellor did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| whoa, you don't even have a valid merit council thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| That's why I drafted it, in order to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| bring everything into compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| continue the same protection for the officers and employees of the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| But that's why it was one of those things that once it got looked into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| we said, whoa, is it still legal to avoid ab initio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| It's void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Like the chancellor said, it was regarded as a charter in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| So just based upon that and the dates you provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| you're saying that essentially for 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Knox County has operated a merit council that's been out of compliance with state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| I would like to request a copy, or request of the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| just to sort of lay out a chronological timeline of actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| I think that would help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| I know this is on first reading, and there is a lot to digest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| but as I've been trying to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| I'm trying to better understand it, as well, if you could provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| I will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| I'm going to go back to Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Another change that has me concerned with the state code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| is it does go back to that 8-8-409,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| the powers and duties of the board that Commissioner Biggs mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| but it's subsection 6, and it says that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| except as otherwise provided in this part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| that the merit system council can formulate and hold competitive tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| The word that bothers me is formulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| Right now, our tests are rented from another company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4109)|
| 1:08:36| that has specific knowledge with what is needed for these applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| and our merit system council, or merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| simply picks them up and administers those tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| Does this, in fact, mean that the merit system council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| could potentially formulate these tests to determine qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| of persons who seek employment in any position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| and establish employment lists of eligibles for the various positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| which I know the merit system does back the eligibility list, but it's formulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| They already do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| They don't formulate the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| They don't create it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| So that was just a word that stuck out that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| If you're going to formulate a test and you want to adopt something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| it's the merit council's authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| and they want to say this is a good test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| I mean, to me, that's formulating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| I don't know that they have to start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| But my concern is that if we get a merit system council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| that wants to start from scratch, that technically says it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| They're going to be the same merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| Well, and also minus the alternate, correct, because there's only three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| So that's another change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| We've spent over a year discussing changes to update the merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| and now we're sending it back to 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| I just have a hard time processing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| It's not taking it back to 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| It's adopting the public act as it exists right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| It is the public law as it sits right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| I don't know what this is about taking it back to 1970 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Commissioner Hill has not spoken on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| I sat down this afternoon and listened to the workshop last Monday to get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| to speed and not knowing anything else except what I heard in the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4248)|
| 1:10:56| because I was not aware of this ordinance being introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4256)|
| 1:11:04| The notes I took were I believe I heard the law director say that there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4264)|
| 1:11:14| be no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| There will be no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| But as I'm hearing questions asked, I'm thinking there are changes, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4279)|
| 1:11:29| Commissioner Ward, I believe you were the one that asked about who do we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| in fact, as a commission, go to for legal counsel if it's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| proposed being changed that is actually brought from our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| This is a conflict that has occurred many times in the past, not only with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| the commission but with our school board also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| It was concerning your question about or someone's question about if the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4317)|
| 1:12:06| director, law department actually allowed to bring an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4326)|
| 1:12:15| The response I believe I heard was yes, but it's been almost 30 years since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4335)|
| 1:12:23| an ordinance change was even proposed through the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4343)|
| 1:12:31| All of this is more than concerning because the elephant in the room is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4351)|
| 1:12:39| wouldn't even probably be before us if it weren't this one case that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| brought up so much disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4363)|
| 1:12:52| And probably had this case not appeared and our law department would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| come to us with this change, it wouldn't be under the fire the way that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| My personal feeling is it is very concerning to try to change in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| of the stream when we have a case like this that is pending that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4391)|
| 1:13:20| Director Buch, I mean, you yourself have referenced it over and over and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| The main takeaway I took after I listened to the meeting this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| was, oh, the Merit Council must have already heard this case because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4410)|
| 1:13:38| statement was in fact made that the Merit Council is giving a car in to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4418)|
| 1:13:48| person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| So there's just been so much said that has been at best misunderstood, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4430)|
| 1:13:58| misunderstood for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| And I cannot support this because I do feel like it has been directed because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| of this one case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| And is it true that the Merit Council just did not know about this until just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4450)|
| 1:14:21| a few days ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| The Merit Council has no say whatsoever in what this commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| They offered their opinion and we did it when we finished it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| We didn't have this thing done until it went public on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| That's when everybody got it at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| And at that time they got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| They received it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| The same time you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| The same time the public got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Everybody got it at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| And it isn't just a coincidence that this occurs when we're in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| all this with this one case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| No, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| It's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| It's much, much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| I'm not going to get into the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| There are – I'm not going to comment on a lawsuit I'm not involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| But there are a lot more issues involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| There's a statement in law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Void is void is void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| And that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| I don't – it's no skin off of me if you don't want to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| I am trying to correct something that's wrong in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| my legal opinion, and five or six other attorneys that agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| If you don't want to pass it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| I don't care because it is going to be heard by a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| I'm trying to take that away from a judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| and you never know what the judge is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| So I'm just – that's all I – I don't care whether you pass it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| I'm trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I'm trying to get the Merit Council in compliance with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| and there is no protection for the officer that is demeaned in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4560)|
| 1:16:08| by adopting the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| Just let me ask a question to kind of clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| So what we have now is not legal in your opinion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Not just my opinion, but five really competent, sharp attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| dealing in governmental law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| And then you've made amendments to what we're doing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| correct, over the years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| So then we adopt this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| You can't amend this though, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Because you said you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| That's correct because it's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| You said it's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| When we adopt this, say it passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| you lose all the amendments that we've made over the last 30 years, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| The amendments, but not the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| Rules are really what's the guts of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| You don't lose the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| This gives the Merit Council the authority to adopt rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| and virtually everything at issue now is in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| And all they've got to do is say we adopt the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| we re-adopt the rules that we've already got so there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| Can we have a list then of what we're going to lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| and what they need to adopt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Because I'm sure they're not even aware of what they need to adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| for the rules going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| So in theory, you wipe out 30 years of whatever we've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| and then they have to go in there because we're going to hit the reset button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| They then have to go in there and re-pass all those rules again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| and make them legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| They can just say we adopt the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| They've got all the rules in a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| They just say we adopt these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| That's all they've got to do in one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| They don't have to go through each and every one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| They just have to say this is the body of the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| that we've been operating under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| We'll continue to operate under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| Okay, so we hit the reset button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| Everything gets reset to zero, and then they have to go and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| we want to adopt all the rules we've been using from our magic book of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Yeah, they do that in one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| And Commissioner Hill, I kind of feel the same way you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| I'm kind of all over the place with this as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| and kind of confused on the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| The timing is not great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| I'm not sure where I'm at either on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| I need some clarification too from the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| When you say they can immediately adopt the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| they do not need commission approval for their rules, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| State law says the same thing that the present ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| Thou shalt adopt any rules necessary, you feel necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| for carrying out this chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Same wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| It doesn't have to come to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| I guess I'll say this and hope that it sounds okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| Not that I question you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| This is a big step, big move you're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| after we've spent this much time diving into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| And we've had some pretty competent law directors since 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4772)|
| 1:19:42| I'm surprised that if this is that layering of a flaw in our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| that it hasn't been tripped upon before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| I'm wondering if we should maybe get an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| from the attorney general to send him the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| what's on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| and ask, is our merit council system valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| before we go changing too much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4805)|
| 1:20:15| Mr. Book, would you like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Like I said, I don't care whether you pass this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| It's going to be in front of a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| I don't care what the AG says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| It already is in front of a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| It's going to be in another lawsuit in front of a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| I'm just trying to do what I consider to be the legally proper thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| to bring us into compliance with state law without hurting anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| If you don't feel that way, don't pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| It's going to be decided by a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| Director Book, I'm trying to understand the authority of each level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| so bear with me for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| Tennessee state law establishes merit councils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| the ability to have one or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| and all of the exhibits that have been noted here that are on the digital agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| looks like pages 1 through 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| Those are all directly out of state law, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Okay, so state law is at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| Well, federal law before that, but we're not into federal world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| Thank God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| So state law establishes it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| and these are all the things that are on the books currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| I'm seeing the date at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| This is copyright 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| This is current state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| Whether we like it or not, it is the current state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| Any ordinance we pass is a Knox County, which is below that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| and then any rules that the merit council operates under is below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| Is that the sandwich?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| That's the sandwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| So the merit council can't adopt any rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| but if they adopt a rule that is in opposition of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| which is in opposition of the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| they couldn't pass a rule that says just pick any one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| They couldn't just make their own rule if it's not in compliance with one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| the other two layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| So if they have a current, let's say this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| and we are in compliance with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| if they have a current rule that says something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| they would have to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Well, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| It's not as easy as just sort of saying we keep operating as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| It's my opinion that there's some ambiguity and vagueness already in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| rules, but those don't really come up until you get an issue with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| filing a grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| That's where they come up with, and that ultimately then is decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| I mean, you can tell them you don't have a good rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| but under the authority granted them, they can create their own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| They can't go past what state law allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| They couldn't create something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| I'm just trying to – this has been confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| And, look, the Merit Council is complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| and the history of it is complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| and everything we've been working on and looking at and going through is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| not an easy small ordinance or operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| But I'm just trying to simplify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| You're essentially saying right now, if I'm correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| you're saying Knox County, for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| whoever didn't see it or whatever the case might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| it's come to your attention that we are not in compliance with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| and you're trying to put us in compliance with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| which would, yes, change how the Merit Council operates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| but it is state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| If we don't do it, the judge will do it for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| or may change it completely a totally different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| We don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| I'm just trying to bring us into compliance with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| to continue to protect officers because right now, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| and several other very competent attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| we don't have a valid Merit Council system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| I'm just trying to bring it into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| If I'm hearing you correctly, your worry is if we take no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| and we are out of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| let's say something happens in the next month or the year or two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| at any point a judge may rule in a lawsuit and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| well, you don't even have a valid Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| because you didn't put it in compliance with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| so anything that happens over these next two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| I'm going to throw out and we're going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| You're essentially worried that a judge will throw out actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| by the Merit Council or this commission between now and whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| because we're not in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| What I hear here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| Director Booke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| is that if we bring back in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| we vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| then we're protected a little bit from the state coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| and saying these are some things that you can only do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| instead of maybe you could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| It's giving us a little bit of leeway to design our Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| and make it more fit to the people in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Well, kind of in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| what I'm trying to say is if you pass this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| then you're clearly in compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| It will not affect the issues that have been raised in the Dooley case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5158)|
| 1:26:07| That's presently in chance report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| That has to do with whether or not Merit Council can give an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| a car for personal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| But what brought this to light was this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| but it can affect us in a very negative way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| if we don't go ahead and get back in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| Commissioner Smith, I'm going to recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| He hasn't spoken on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| I guess two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| One, things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| As an example, we've been hearing about the opioid settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| for probably a year and a half now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| but because a few of us attended a conference ten days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| we found out that there was a deadline to be able to have a resolution passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| and submitted to the state, which we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| So I guess my question is I'd like to have maybe one or two of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| who are kind of on the fence on this to explain why we would not want Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| to come into compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| I think that would help my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| So there's a few of you that have gone on the record to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| hey, you have questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| If I could have one or both say why they don't want Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| to comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| Commissioner Smith, I recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| I actually would like to weigh in on this next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Mr. Law Director, if a chance for you judge were to rule on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| there are really only two options he could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| One is just fill it out because we don't have a mayor council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| or two, he can make us comply with the 1974 Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| I don't think he can make you comply with the Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| That would be a judiciary reaching down to the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5292)|
| 1:28:20| and telling them what they had to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| I think his decision would be whether or not there's a valid mayor council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| He wouldn't say you've got to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| He'd just say that's the opinion he would give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| the same way that Chancellor Weaver did in the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| All he said was he didn't say you've got to pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| although he did say 30 days to try to remedy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| 30 days passed and nothing was remedied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| And you said that there's essentially nothing different between the 1974 Sheriff's Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5333)|
| 1:29:01| and the 1970 Public Act, Private Act that was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| that Knox County chose to establish its mayor council under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| If adopted, the 1974 Act, the mayor council would have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| to adopt every single rule they have currently right now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| And you said there is some, I'm going to never pronounce this word right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| ambiguity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| In those rules, if they adopt those same rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| aren't we in the same place we are right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| If they had the same rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| wouldn't you still find that they didn't have the right to have that hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| You'd be right back here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| No, what I'm saying is the rules, well, that issue is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| If they, which has been alleged in the other lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| that the mayor council had no authority under law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| to even hear the grievance of somebody that wanted a personal use car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| and a personal use gas credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| That is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| That's, they had no authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| And their rules don't say they have authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| In fact, it was contrary to their rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| That's what's alleged in that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| It's even contrary to the rules that they established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Would there be a need to weed the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| and get a legal opinion on whether the rules are enforceable and legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5430)|
| 1:30:39| No, because right now I think the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| they create their own rules and they live by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| The lawsuit is your rule didn't even provide for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| You, mayor council, I'm trying to, this is all public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| The lawsuit says you, mayor council, you just pulled out of the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| and said you have authority to hear a grievance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| that wasn't a reduction in salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| You violated your own rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| That's what that says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| It didn't say the rule was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| It said you violated your own rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| and you violated what the appellate courts of the state of Tennessee had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| That's what that lawsuit said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| So the common law aspect of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5481)|
| 1:31:29| it's your opinion that the merit council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| if it doesn't exist, that sheriff's deputies are employees at will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| like the rest of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| If you have no merit system, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5503)|
| 1:31:53| I don't want to get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| I do want to weigh in briefly before I call on Commissioner Hill again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| because I don't have any inherent right to be the last one to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| So I want to respond a little bit to Commissioner Schoonmaker's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| I'm not one of the commissioners that stated that I was on the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| but a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| I want to do the right thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| And as I look around this dais,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| I think a lot of my colleagues are in the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| The deal is that this may be innocent and harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| It truly may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| And listen, this is not a commentary on Mr. Boog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| I've always had the utmost respect for David Boog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| and his understanding of government law, or any of his predecessors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| But the reality is that the timing of this just makes me nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5569)|
| 1:32:58| In real world, real time, the timing, the optics of this are not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| Because the most contentious thing this commission has dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| over the past 12 months has been the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| And now we are once again here being asked to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| what could amount to a sweeping change in the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| And even though it may be innocent, harmless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| and nothing more than a technicality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| it doesn't necessarily look and feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| In response to the question of why would you not want to come into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| with state law, I can definitely speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| Because I lived through the Jordan case and all the ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| and the fallout of the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| And when you're dealing with a home rule county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| not everything is as cut and dried as it might appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| The Constitution of the state of Tennessee says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| that constitutional office holders shall be elected to terms of four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| That's all it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Commissioners, registers, clerks, it does not limit their terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| Knox County Charter, however, does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| And so the Supreme Court says because you're a home rule county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| and you've got a charter, you can essentially trump the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| That's why I'm saying compliance with state law can sometimes get a little blurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| when it comes to charter counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| So I don't know. I don't know where I am on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| I obviously don't want to do something that puts us at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| What happened with the Jordan case was they said you don't have a charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| your term limits are valid, fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| That may well be what a judge says here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| If a judge says we're out of compliance with the 1974 law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| and we're operating on an old law, he may just say fix it, and we fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| I'd also remind my colleagues this is a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| We can hear this ordinance on second reading anytime or never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| So I don't know for sure on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| I want to do the right thing regardless of politics or personalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| I want to do the right thing for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| So I'll move on. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| And really to piggyback on what you said, Mr. Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| to respond to you, Chairman Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| and I need to preface this by the same thing that the Chair did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| David, I swear this isn't personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| I promise you it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| One of the other things I wrote down this afternoon that was a direct quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| was I wouldn't have said it if it wasn't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| Now, I'm here to tell you we all know that to get attorneys to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5749)|
| 1:36:00| on the interpretation of a law is about as muddled as black and white sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5760)|
| 1:36:08| That's clearly why we end up in the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| because attorneys interpret laws differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| So much like our Chairman just stated, we all want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5777)|
| 1:36:27| And whether whoever it might be that is the final interpreter of state law says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| yes, this is in fact correct or not correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| in the end may in fact be a different opinion of what many other attorneys may believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5798)|
| 1:36:46| So, again, as much as it seems like there would be a black and white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| there truly is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| Commissioner Ward is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| I agree with what the Chair said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| I kind of like the idea of Commissioner Smith to send this to the AG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| give us a professional opinion on what he thinks of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| and then I'd be fine to vote whichever way the AG kind of interprets what we have looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| I just don't feel knowledgeable enough at this moment to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| There's a big part of me that wants to pass it because it sounds like the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| and there's another part of me that's got a whole bunch of questions still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| But I'd be willing to postpone this just to give the AG enough time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| especially with holidays and everything, to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| give us a professional response, and then have a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| Mr. Luke, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| Number one, the AG only answers questions submitted by the legislator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5861)|
| 1:37:48| so we can't submit one to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| Secondly, I'm looking around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| There's not a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| I can tell that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Like I told you, I don't care what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| I'm just trying to put this out and saying this is the right thing to do, preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| You don't agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Don't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| In fact, I was at the point where I was saying, well, geez, after the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| I'll just withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| But I'd rather I know where you stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Just go ahead and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Turn it down if that's what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Because I can see there's not two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| So just do it, and let's move on to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| I'll recognize Commissioner Ward and then Commissioner Leslie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| Let me respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| We care what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| That's why we're all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| Maybe, you know, so I'll take a little offense to that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| If I got a call, you know, Jason Zachary and ask him, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| can you go get AG's opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| Like, I can make the phone call right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| This isn't like it's out of the realm of possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| But I think all of us here want to do our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| I don't necessarily want to vote this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| Right now I'm a pass vote because I don't want to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| I don't want to vote against it because I don't know enough information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| I don't think there's any harm in, you know, hunting this 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| just so we get a little bit more information so we can have a little bit more clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| because I know it sounds like there is a lot of us that aren't quite sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| But I also want to make sure I do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| and I don't want our taxpayers to have to go hire outside legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| to then go fight this in court if that's going to have to happen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| So, yeah, we're in between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| Give us 30 more days to do a little bit more due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| Let's get some more answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| Let's get a little more comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| We've had, what, a week to look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| This is more legal jargon than I'd like to, you know, care to read about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| I personally need more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| I'm a pass right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Commissioner Daly, you have not spoken on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| You're the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| I'll recognize you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| The pass would be a no-no, a vote is a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| So I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| We have a call for the question by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| It requires a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Madam Clerk, you can commence with a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| I'm going to start in the Third Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| This is a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| So a yes vote is we are going to then vote on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6021)|

| 1:40:52| I'm going to vote, but I want to say one thing that I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| that I don't think any of you else heard from our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| was that right now, because of a ruling fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6059)|
| 1:41:07| we do not have a valid merit counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| So anything that's brought up and gone to a judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| the opposite side could use that against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| So I'm going to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6081)|

| 1:41:37| because I have a substitute motion that I was hoping to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| before we got to following the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| Commissioner Jay votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6103)|

| 1:42:03| Commissioner Lundy votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Does the past wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| I'd like to hear what Commissioner Jay would like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| so I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Commissioner Ward votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| Commissioner Hill changes her vote to no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| I will as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6139)|
| 1:42:34| The vote is three ayes and eight noes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| so the call for the question fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| I will recognize Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| I think this is important to get clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| I think it's important to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| I don't want to – I'm still confused on many points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| and I'd like better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| I don't want to vote against something that may help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| but I don't want to vote for something that we still have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| So I have a substitute motion to delay the first reading of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| for a time certain of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| If we want to take it up sooner, if we get a question sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| but I can't imagine with the holidays we'll get one faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| So that is my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| I have a motion by Commissioner Jay with a second by Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| to postpone this, and I'm going to clarify this, to the January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| It's going to be the January 24th commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| Commissioner Smith, your line is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| I would like to ask Commissioner Jay if he would be willing to accept a friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| amendment to also ask for one of our legislators to ask for an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| from the Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| I think it would be appropriate for the commission chair to ask our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| delegation to take that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| I'm good with that as a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| So we have a motion by Commissioner Jay, second by Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| to postpone first reading of this item to the January 24th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| and for the chair to request that a member or our state legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6250)|
| 1:44:18| to ask for an opinion from the Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| It's still on Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| Law Director Boock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| I have no problem with this body passing that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| but to get the question to the AG it needs to be a properly worded question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6273)|
| 1:44:41| Those of us who practice law know that you've got to get the right question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| to get the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| And so if you're going to go to Jason Zachary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| I would appreciate if you would allow me to submit to Jason Zachary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| everything we've talked about so that the AG knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| and understands exactly what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| Would the maker of the motion be willing to allow the chair to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| with the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Commissioner Skinmaker, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| Or maybe it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| I think it was Mr. Boock's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Is there any further discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| The motion is to postpone this to January 24th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| with the chair to work with the law director on formulating a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| to have a legislator from the Knox County delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| request an Attorney General's opinion on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6343)|

| 1:45:46| Matter is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6346)|

| 1:46:56| Is this a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| Are votes fine on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| It would be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| In this ordinance, is there any kind of piggyback from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| to help us since we're going to be doing something like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| Are they going to comply with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| No, not at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| The city's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| So they're not kind of throwing something together like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| Well, I'll say that Council Smith and I are working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6443)|

| 1:48:19| Does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| The vote is 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| And that ordinance passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Madam Clerk, let's move to item 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Discussion item Blue Oval Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Commissioner Besseler, this is your discussion item, so you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6505)|
| 1:48:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| So the Blue Oval development is right outside of Memphis and they had been planning this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6530)|
| 1:49:01| development for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| It's the new Ford truck plant that's going to be making nothing but electric trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6544)|
| 1:49:12| I've got some information that still is forthcoming from the developers and from the state where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6552)|
| 1:49:21| they got this development together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| But they started years ago, I think it was like 10, 12 years ago or so, getting the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| And they got a consortium between about five counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| And they used this term, what they had to sell this, Ford Motor Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| They said they had water, which we have a navigable waterway here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| They said they had the trains and we have train access here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| And they talked about the interstates, their infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| We have I-40 and I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| We even have part of the 81 that comes through here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| The only thing we didn't have was the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| But they got other counties together and put everybody together and developed a large part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6606)|
| 1:50:13| of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| We had that opportunity years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| It bothered me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| We had the technology corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| But we had the MPC and other people coming by wanting to build single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| We were set for a big development here in the Knox area with the property we had then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| And we just weren't forward looking enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| But we still got the ability to do some bigger properties and access to the things that Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6636)|
| 1:50:45| has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| And we ought to start looking right now with some other counties that have land that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| available and see what we can do together and have a committee that works with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| counties and see if we can put something together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| And one of the things that they did was very important for the Ford Motor Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| Out of the 4,100 acres that they had for that company, they have 350 acres of solar panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6664)|
| 1:51:11| that's going to be developed to do their electric, their power that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6671)|
| 1:51:18| And we also have the ability here in this area and the climate that has a lot of sunlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| And we can also see what we can do to help people come in here and be powered by solar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| But we do need to start now because it's going to be years before you get to that point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| you get something like that for the area that's good for the whole East Tennessee area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| And so I just thought I'd just throw that out to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| But we have all the amenities that we need to bring big companies in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6702)|
| 1:51:49| But we don't use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| There's some reason that we can't work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| We can't work with some counties around us, but I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| And there's counties around here that have large pieces of property that we could put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| together if they would be willing to partner with Knox County and other counties around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| And one other thing about the space, they figured that most of the people that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6729)|
| 1:52:16| be working in that Ford plant will have anywhere from a 30 to a 45-minute drive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6736)|
| 1:52:25| And I figured out how big of an area that we could cover with a 30 or a 45-minute drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| So we've got a lot of people we could put to work, and we've got a lot of ways of making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| our county a lot better by looking at that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| And again, I've got stuff coming from the state that shows how they put everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| And that's why I wanted to bring that up and see if we could put maybe a committee together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| to start working with other counties to see if we could start developing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| And it'll be a long time before we can get the land together, but we should start working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| on something for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| I'm going to look at my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Would the commissioners like to take a break right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| I actually have an item of other business to come after the next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| Would you be agreeable to going into recess now and reconvening at 6.55?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6796)|
| 1:53:25| We're in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| This meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6806)|
| 1:53:34| Madam Clerk, we are on item 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| Discussion item of the Tennessee Department of Transportation and right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| I'll look to Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| While I was in Memphis down there, there's a bunch of things that I'm on transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| And there's a couple of things that will be coming up this year that we really need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| look at, and it has to do with the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Number one, one is a rule change put out by TDOT itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| And they don't have to bring it before legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| They've got a rule change that says any county road that crosses a state highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6848)|
| 1:54:15| that the county would be responsible for the upkeep of the right-of-way and any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| drainage problems and things around those right-of-ways that crosses over that state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| Now, if you don't think that's something, if they decide to widen the road, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| be responsible in the county to move the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| We're on the state line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| The state now moves the utilities and takes that into their costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| But that would revert back to the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| The other rule is about the change of requiring developers in some of the development about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6886)|
| 1:54:55| right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| They have legislation that's coming back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| We thought we had it killed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| But it's rearing its ugly head again about giving the developers a chance to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6903)|

| 1:55:17| so they wouldn't have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| If they extended or expanded the roads in the county, then a developer would get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| of paying for that right-of-way fee that they're doing right now because they are causing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| problem of having developed the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| And that's coming in as a piece of legislation that I was told is going to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6938)|
| 1:55:44| It would go right into the MPC where they could grant or not grant the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6944)|
| 1:55:51| being given to the county and easier to, later on, work our utilities through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6951)|
| 1:56:00| So anyway, that was two pieces about things that I learned out there that's kind of worrisome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| The first one is about crossing roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| I know our county just went down Emory Road and counted how many of our roads cross there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| And if we have to keep those roads taken care of by drainage and this other stuff, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| Emory Road alone will cost this county millions of dollars each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| So anyway, we just need to talk to our legislation to make sure that PDOT doesn't put that into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| the rules and regulations they don't have to vote on as legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| So anyway, that's what I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| There's other things that we learned at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| But anyway, that's the two things that's kind of troublesome about what it could cost the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| Thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Mr. Bussler, would you get with the law department and have a resolution come up stating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| we'll be against those two issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| I think we as a county commission ought to pass it to our state delegations and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| hey, we're not behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| We're not going to put the county millions and millions of dollars in debt just to appease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| There are some developers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| This is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| Well, Commissioner Bussler is saying this is bad for us in Moss County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Just to follow up on Commissioner Bussler, when planning, someone comes for planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7043)|
| 1:57:31| to do a subdivision, we pay 20 or 25 people right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| But what they're wanting to do is that the developer, this bill wants the developer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7055)|
| 1:57:41| keep that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| If we ever widen the road, we have to turn around and go buy that piece of property from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| that developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| That ain't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| And we're providing the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| We're providing the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| Those two things, Mr. Bussler, we need to do a resolution on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| Hopefully, we'll all pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7081)|

| 1:58:04| We'll make sure that David Bukas has something to do over the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| No, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| And on that subject, I'm going to be reaching out to Senator Massey tomorrow to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| some dates for our legislative luncheon or breakfast with the state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| And I'll also have Drew send an email outlining what the different commissioners may think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7104)|
| 1:58:33| are issues we want to bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| I'll be getting with Commissioner Jay to look at last year's, he has sent me last year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| Some of them I think we were successful on, but there are several that no action's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| taken on as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| The other item of business I wanted to call to your attention is, as you know, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| a judicial appointment coming up in the next several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| We have solicited applications to fill the seat of Judge Emery who is retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7143)|

| 1:59:19| Just as I was looking at the calendar, if we simply add the appointment as an agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| item in December, we're looking at a December 20th appointment date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| And that would give whoever the appointee is ten days essentially to inform their current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7169)|
| 1:59:36| employer or clients or whatever the case may be of their new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7176)|

| 2:04:52| Thank you, Ms. Brooks. Mr. Maddox, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| I'm requesting that the County Commission approve the zoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| and as was recommended by the Planning Commission in the October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| Thank you, sir. Any questions? Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Hello, Mr. Maddox. How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| Thank you. Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| I have a question for you and then first I have a question for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| Director Brooks, the general zoning, what are the parameters for the development of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7518)|
| 2:05:25| The review and the process for landscaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| There are no specific landscaping requirements for the CA zoning that he is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7529)|
| 2:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| So it does not require additional plan review by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| I believe that. Does that answer your question, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| Yeah, that does actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| Mr. Maddox, this piece of property fronts both on Ball Camp and the new Chaud Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7548)|
| 2:05:55| Do you have an idea of where your orientation of your entrance to the businesses will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| I'm sorry. I couldn't really understand what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| This property fronts both on Ball Camp and Chaud Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| Do you have an indication of where your orientation for the front of these buildings will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7568)|
| 2:06:15| Yes. These buildings will all front onto Chaud Road and the Ball Camp Road will be on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7575)|
| 2:06:24| and we plan to landscape across the back and what would be the most southern end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7584)|
| 2:06:31| there is a buffer that's already in there that actually belongs to a neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| but it's like a grown-up buffer now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| But I'm actually working with Knox County to put a road through there from Ball Camp to Chaud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7598)|
| 2:06:49| that would make a nice addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| It would be like a relief valve for the intersection there at Chaud Road and Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7613)|
| 2:07:01| I'm sorry, Chaud Road and Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| Ms. Brooks, typically whenever we put commercial property up against residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| we tend to go with planned commercial so that there are some available tools to provide buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7630)|
| 2:07:18| Is there a reason in this particular case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| It's a particularly small piece of property for planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| Typically you're looking at 20 acres or more is the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| So that's one of the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| We did talk to Mr. Maddox about, and you'll see it in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| a recommendation to follow buffering and landscaping standards that are found in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7660)|
| 2:07:46| especially against the properties that are adjacent there to the residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7666)|
| 2:07:51| Typically on the size property, it would be neighborhood commercial to provide that, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7671)|
| 2:07:58| That has been considered in the past, yes, I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| Okay, so I guess we're relying on, sir, your honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| to make sure that these people who have seen a great deal of change in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7686)|
| 2:08:12| from their front porches, that you do what you can to protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| Yes, sir, and for the rest of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| we're just now getting to the point to where we're starting our landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| for the rest of the main part of the Grassy Creek development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7704)|
| 2:08:29| The roads are in now and almost complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| The street lighting's almost in and all those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| And so now we're starting our landscaping along the roads and on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| So this property will tie in with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| Yes, but this will be actually across the street and much closer to residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| And I've met with the owners, the adjoining property owners, and they're all satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| I make a motion that we accept this as approved by the Knox County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7747)|

| 2:09:23| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7765)|

| 2:10:24| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve C.A. General Business zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| because it is a minor extension of the commercial node that has been established since 2017 by Vote 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7830)|
| 2:10:37| Any discussion or questions for Mr. Maddox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| Chairwoman, entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| I'd like to make a motion to approve this to C.A. and just in response to Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7842)|
| 2:10:58| our district splits right there, which was, I'm certain, what his questions were from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7858)|
| 2:11:05| And I have to say, Mr. Maddox, I'm very pleased with what you've done in that whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| And it's just looking better every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| So I'm very comfortable with this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Hill as per the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| The second is by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| Mr. Smith, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| I just wanted to piggyback off of Commissioner Hill that this development is looking really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7888)|
| 2:11:35| And it's been a real asset to the community to have this development go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7895)|
| 2:11:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| And just for everybody's information, that Food City that's open there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7904)|
| 2:11:50| that was the number one grand opening month of any store in their chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7910)|
| 2:11:57| So it's really doing well out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7920)|

| 2:12:05| Mr. Maddox, we approved, I think it was a pilot for this property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| There was a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| TIF for some of the infrastructure, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| And that was able to help you get this off the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| I would love the Commission to just remember this is one of those great examples of when we use a financing tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| that doesn't cost the taxpayers anything financially, but has a huge economic win for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| and how we can use our TIFs, our pilots, our tools to put a little wind in the sail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7951)|
| 2:12:37| with some of our private sector partners and really bring something to life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| that's going to be a huge benefit to everybody in the community as well as our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| Not only improvements in that to right there to make this development work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| but also then for the main roads, Chaud Road and Oak Ridge Highway, that whole area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=7977)|

| 2:15:06| but I think we received a letter from an organization out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| that actually looked forward to this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| and I think part of the reason was they don't have businesses out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| because there aren't enough residents in that area to attract businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211115?start=8116)|
