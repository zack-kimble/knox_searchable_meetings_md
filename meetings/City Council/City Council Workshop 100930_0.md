| 0:01:52| It is 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| We are having a workshop on the tenure plan and chronic homelessness to go over communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| and operational growth changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| Let me start by asking Mr. Bailey to say a word of blessing and I will ask Mr. Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=123)|
| 0:02:11| to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| If you all please rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| Would you bow with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Dear God, we thank you for this beautiful day and all its many blessings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=139)|

| 0:02:27| for our freedom and those that fought for it and continue to fight for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Help us to be mindful of all the things we have and to be good stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| Be with the less fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| We thank you for all those that are here with us tonight and be with us as we lead and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| pray that we lead in a way that is acceptable to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=163)|

| 0:02:51| home safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| In your name, in Christ's name we pray, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=183)|
| 0:03:13| Ms. Wilson, can you call the roll please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=193)|

| 0:03:25| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| I know that Mr. Greave and Mr. Woodhall are both on pre-scheduled vacations out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=208)|
| 0:03:45| and both called to let me know that and plan to follow up and either listen to the tape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| or watching the video if this is being videoed, which it looks like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| Yes, we have a thumbs up up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| So thank you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| This is a workshop on mostly on the communication plan of the tenure plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| If you all recall back in April, we passed a resolution asking city council, asking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| tenure plan to improve its communications and to report back to us on how they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| This is their report on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Part B down there, the operational growth, I think there is some work going on within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| the tenure plan and how the systems are being improved and I asked them to do a brief report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| on that while they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| So with that, are there any statements from council before we turn it over to Mr. Lawler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| If not, Mr. Lawler, take us away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| And let me say, this is designed actually if people want to interrupt and ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| they should feel free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Do use your lights, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| I will try and recognize people as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=292)|
| 0:05:07| It's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Do you want to see if one of the other microphones is working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| We're on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Oh, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Touched one, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| I was just thanking you for allowing us to have this workshop, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Here are the two objectives of the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| First, we wanted to present our communications plan that has been created in response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| the resolution you passed on April 20, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| And then secondly, it's like Vice Mayor Becker said, we want to update you on everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=342)|
| 0:05:51| we do in the 10-year plan outside of the development of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| So often we spend our time in front of you in this arena talking about permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| The 10-year plan has nine strategies and we want to talk to you about how those strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| are being implemented right now and how we think they're going to continue to be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| in a more effective way going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| This is a terrible slide, but you have it in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| This is the verbiage from the resolution you passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| The important things here, you ask us to develop a communications plan associated when we work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=384)|
| 0:06:33| with the development partner to develop permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| And in that resolution you also talked about the broad-based nature of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| So tonight I want to talk about two things regarding communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| First, our comprehensive communications plan, and then secondly, this public notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| policy that we've been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| I just told you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| I've sent to you a couple days ago, and Councilman Brown, I'm sorry, I just got yours to you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| but our work plan associated with the communications piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| And that work plan is something we wake up every day thinking about and implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| But it has six strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| And what I want to do is go through each strategy and allow you to ask questions on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| because I'm going to tell you, this is not a plan that is in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| It's a plan that is continually evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| As you remember from the resolution, you ask us to present this plan to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| and your input will go in to help continue to shape this plan and make it more effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| But the first strategy, as you see there, has to do with our efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| to engage the community in a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| And we're going to do that from the public input meetings we've been having on a monthly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| primarily at Councilor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| We'll start spreading those out a little more, explore site out east at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| A lot of discussions with special interest groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| I've been to many Rotary clubs, Optimist clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| I've got the mugs to prove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| And just we all, whether it's Robert Finley from our office or Michael Dunthorne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| we're all trying to get out, talk to neighborhood groups, talk to the different civic clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| Thirdly, there has been a Speaker's Bureau that's in the formation stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| We've got five or six people who have said they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| And our communications partner, Ackerman, is helping train those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| and come up with a common talk that we're going to be giving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| they're going to be giving as they go out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| because they're starting to get some requests for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Number four is interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| It's a neighborhood advisory team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| We talk to a lot of neighborhoods individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| The concept here is, what if we were to create a neighborhood advisory team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| made up of neighborhood representatives from the many different neighborhood groups across the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| And this is a little bit of an amorphous entity right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| Robert Finley is providing leadership on this for our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| And what he's doing is talking to Dave Massey, talking to Grant Rosenberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| talking to other neighborhood leaders to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| if the 10-year plan were to create this and have on a regular basis an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| to come and talk to you about issues related to the implementation of the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| or other issues that are important to you about the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| who should be on this? How should they be selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| But our goal, as you can see from that work plan, is by December 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| to have this thing put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| So it's in the form at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| But again, it's a way to regularly interface with neighborhood leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| and give them an opportunity to dialogue with us about the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| and ask questions about that plan as it relates to neighborhood interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| Fifthly, every development, the Flinagan, Menvillas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| go have what we call a development advisory team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| And these are just small teams of people from those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| They're in partnership with the developer or the owner of the property, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| that are creating a dialogue input on the development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| and then the operation process of those developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| We're constructing a community database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| As many community meetings as we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| we now have quite a few names of people who have engaged our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| And this way, when we have, because of their zip code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| and we have certain information pertaining to an issue that's germane to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| we can zip it out to this database to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| and it makes communication, again, more effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| And the final piece of this strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| and fortunately every strategy is not this involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| so we'll move a little faster after this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| but we envision once a year having a homeless summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| And the purpose here, as it's envisioned at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| is why don't we find a city or a couple of cities that have walked this path before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| have a day where we invite them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Some of their time will be spent, if we get your counterparts in those cities to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| part of the time will be spent dialoguing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| Part of it will be bringing a speaker in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| maybe a mayor or someone else who's implemented a similar plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| and talks about the benefits, the headaches, the successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| Just a time where we can talk about ending homelessness through plans like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| through interaction with leaders who have been successful in implementing these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| So that was a big one, and again, that's the longest one we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| But any questions about that as I move to strategy number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Thank you, Mr. Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Just now when you were talking about the homeless summit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| I heard you talk about the objective to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| And it seems like what we're trying to get our arms around is addressing chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| perhaps not homelessness in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Am I correct about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Yes, the plan has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| This is still planned to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| But Knoxville, like all others, well, Houston's a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| When they focused on ending chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| and they started coordinating services between providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| it made all the services better coordinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| And so it ended up serving more effectively and efficiently the entire homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| Our office still wakes up and will continue to wake up every morning focused on ending chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| supporting the development of permanent supportive housing, not all types of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| just permanent supportive housing because that's what best serves the chronically homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| But what we're seeing, which is a great spinoff of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| every homeless service provider is becoming more and more effective at ending homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| for the other segments of the homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| Okay. I just wanted to be clear that I think unfortunately, tragically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| there will always be folks who find themselves for a number of reasons in a situation of homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| and that our targeted efforts are really at that far end of the spectrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| in terms of trying to address the chronic homeless that are absorbing such a large amount of our resources and our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| That's exactly right. I appreciate that point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Yes. On that summit, homeless summit, have you looked at cities of similar size and population in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=815)|
| 0:13:46| And have you actually been to any cities to go and look and observe and see what is working and what is not working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| Have you been doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Councilman Brown, what you're getting at is something we're finding to be the biggest challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| Michael Dunthorne, our office, is really the champion of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| And his biggest challenge is finding a city in similar size to Knoxville with a similar set of demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=843)|
| 0:14:11| that is trying to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| Because if we go to New York and bring all the leaders from New York in here, you're going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| yeah, New York is one thing, Knoxville is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| So we have not found that city yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| You know, we've been to Denver, we've been to Seattle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| But we haven't found the city that is a good mirror image of Knoxville yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| But that's what we're aiming to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| And we hope we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| Yeah, that's enough said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Mr. Pravlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| I want to go back to number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| And I appreciate your efforts to have public input meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| But you and I have had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| I've had it at least two more times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| You all have got to let us know when this is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| I mean, these meetings, I mean, for example, and this wasn't necessarily on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| but, you know, they had that meeting called last Friday for the verandas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| And, you know, it's a pretty sensitive meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| And I knew about it the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| And, you know, I couldn't make the time that it was set up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| So you and I have had this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| But, again, I want to emphasize, it's not my district, it's anybody's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| You have got to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Great point, and a point well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| As we are trying to push to hand off some communication responsibility to our development partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| and to the owners, we have had some missteps there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| And so that's well noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| I know that Knoxville Leadership Foundation heard that loud and clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| that when a meeting regarding Flinagan is going to happen, they need to come to you first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| just as if it was someone else's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| they'd go to them first to make sure they're available for that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| And Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| This is a follow-up to Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| You said that you have been looking for cities with similar demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| to look at what they're doing to address this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Have you looked at cities with similar demographics to find out why they're not addressing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| Is it because they have no homeless problem there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| or is it because they're using their resources for other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| Because sometimes when people don't do something, there's as much value as when they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| Well, it's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| The truth is what we're looking for on top of what you said, the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| is a city that's out in front of us as far as implementing a 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| I think what happened is the larger cities, the Bush administration went after the larger cities first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| because obviously they had a bigger problem, and got them to craft the plans to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| And then it got the secondary cities and then to the third-tier cities, much like Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| So the challenge is going to be, Norfolk, Virginia, is very similar to Knoxville demographically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| and they're a little ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| But demographically, are they similar enough, because they're influenced quite a bit by the Navy population there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1016)|
| 0:17:05| are they similar enough that it would be a good city to invite here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| I think our challenge is those third-tier cities all started about the time or after us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| Ms. Palmer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Well, last night, Mayor Bloomberg from New York was on the Letterman Show, and the issue of homelessness came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| And he made the statement that the city of New York has about 3,500 chronically homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| So obviously, even though it's a much bigger city, there's something going on there for that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| for the size of New York to have such a small amount of people who are chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| Perhaps there is some value in looking at what New York is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| and perhaps finding out how they've managed to go that far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| because Mayor Bloomberg certainly gives the impression that he's quite tight with the pocketbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| and the resources that would be expended for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| It would be interesting to know how many chronically homeless they've housed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| But what you're getting at, the things that have worked in every city are pretty transferable to another city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1080)|
| 0:18:08| regardless of the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| What we want to do, though, is bring to you a city that you would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| they're more similar than dissimilar to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| If there are no more questions, I have a quick point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| I just want to recognize County Commissioner Mr. Jeff Owenby, who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| We always appreciate other bodies coming to learn and hear from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| And Mr. Lawler, continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Strategy number two, government leaders, this is where we make an attempt to communicate better with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| And we do this two ways, face-to-face, which tonight's a great example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| And then secondly, I really appreciate those of you that are willing to drop into our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| Several of you have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| That's very helpful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| You don't have to schedule a time, but any time you want to drop by and just share your thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| that's always very helpful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| So our door is open to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| And secondly, these regular written communications, you get those on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| And I'd like to know, have those been helpful to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| None of heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Frequently what's in those communications, the idea is great, I have no problem with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| but usually I've read it someplace else, usually in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| So from that standpoint, I think you need to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| but you need to be aware that somebody else is beating you to the punch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| Is there anything you would like to hear about on a weekly basis that you're currently not getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Actually, you know, Ms. Palmer, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Sometimes I'll read something in the paper and then read it there and realize, all right, the paper says it's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| John Lawler, do I believe it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| That's like if you've been to the same meeting that is reported sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| But it's in writing, so we at least know it's in writing, so there's some advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| I greatly appreciate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Let's go to strategy number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| This is our attempt to move and develop a series of media relation activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| As you can imagine, this is just us making ourselves available to the different media avenues out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1210)|
| 0:20:21| So nothing complicated about that other than trying to keep ourselves in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| Strategy number four, establishing a strong online presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| You're well aware that when we established the office, we established an online presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| Several of you have given us advice and have given us some good constructive criticism about our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1235)|
| 0:20:44| Ackerman has been very good to help us think through how to improve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| and Robert Finley, of course, is the champion of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| Also talking about the different social media platforms, how do we use those more successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| And also using our website and these social media platforms as a way to create dialogue between us and the public about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1259)|
| 0:21:08| So Robert is right now in the midst of really crafting what will all these look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| because it really has to do with an overall social media Internet strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| So any questions about that one, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| Strategy number five, we're developing just some generic communication pieces that we can pass out at the civic meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1286)|
| 0:21:38| whether it's just a general fact sheet about the 10-year plan, an overview of the 10-year plan, or an FAQ sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| These are things that we just good leave behind, and again, Robert is working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| and this really needs to dovetail with the previous slide we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| that what we're doing through our website really needs to connect well with what we're passing out in our printed pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| and they should each direct one to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| So this is something that's in process, but you have on that worksheet when we're trying to get this completed by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| And finally, we would like on a biannual basis to be able to just give a status of the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1333)|
| 0:22:21| really talk about as we develop more and more metrics to measure success, report in on how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| We talk a lot about how many individuals have been placed in permanent supportive housing, how many have stayed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| how many individuals have been case managed that are at risk in KCDC high-rises, how many have been evicted to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| We talk about stuff like that, but that we'd have a meeting to really talk about what are the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| and what is the difference it's making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| One of the things we're working on right now with regard to what kind of difference it's making is we're in partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| with the health department, the University of Tennessee, conducting a pretty good study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| about looking at a random sampling of individuals who have been housing for more than a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| what did they cost the community two years before they were housed, what did they cost a year after they were housed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| to see what kind of savings or extra cost there may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| But again, this is something that's gone through the independent review board at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| This is us doing the study. The health department's really leading the charge on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| And because it's going through the independent review board, it will have a stamp of credibility so that the results are the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| and it's not something we've just cooked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| So again, that's something we're looking forward to see, to say, okay, the cost benefit, how are we doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1417)|
| 0:23:47| The final piece that I want to present is talk about the public notification policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| Again, I sent that to you yesterday, and I hope you all still have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| This is still, as I said, in the draft form because we've passed this to the law director to say, okay, how do you see this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1439)|
| 0:24:10| When you look at this through the fair housing lens, is it appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| But the big concepts here, and your resolution was really pointing us in this direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| why don't you have a real standardized process that gives direction to developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| who are interested in acquiring city funds for the development of permanent supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| And so here's the process in general terms is that the developer will have 90 days to get site control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1473)|
| 0:24:41| and do his or her due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| Once that 90 days is up, then let's say the property is going to be buildable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| something that the developer is willing to put down hard money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| At that point, for approximately 90 days or a minimum of 90 days, the developer will begin to engage the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1497)|
| 0:25:06| That will be through a series of mailings to surrounding neighborhoods about what permanent supportive housing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| what the development is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| It will be a series of community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Whatever it takes to engage the neighborhoods that are close to the locations of where this housing is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1517)|
| 0:25:26| and gives them an opportunity to understand what permanent supportive housing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| and to really wrestle with the questions of suitability as far as is this an appropriate site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1531)|
| 0:25:38| The developers will make sure it has good access to a grocery store, it's on public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| that it's zoned correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| The developer is going to do that, but we'll talk about other criteria that are also important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| So this will have at least a 90-day process where the developer can dialogue with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1552)|
| 0:26:01| and we'll help facilitate that dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| And then finally, we would come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| And as you well know, there are funds dedicated in the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| and the consolidated five-year plan for the development of permanent supportive housing, these federal pass-through funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| At that point, we would come to you and talk to you about your willingness to direct the mayor to enter into a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1578)|
| 0:26:28| with a developer to commit these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| So it's 90 days the developer has to site control due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| at least 90 days to do just a good public discussion about the site, about what permanent supportive housing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| how it's going to be run, all those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| and then finally coming to you with the details of what's this development going to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| from a sources and uses standpoint and where do the city funds fit in the whole funding mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| I actually had a question myself before I saw your light, Mr. De La Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| John, does the process end with that city council resolution vote or is there –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| what's the process that goes on after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Because my recollection is there is some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Well, it's – this is – traditionally, we have come to you at the end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| So the developer traditionally has been working to put the sources together for 18 months before we ever come to you for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| This is turning that upside down a little bit, where we'll come to you first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| where you'll be obligating those funds contingent upon the developer fully funding the project with other sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| whether those are low-income housing tax credits or grants from the Federal Loan Bank or a variety of other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| So we're – the developer would be here before you probably 18 months before this transaction would really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1666)|
| 0:27:57| So this is – when we come to you, it's not a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| In fact, when the developer comes to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| I would say the developer still has a lot of anxiety about all the things that developer has to accomplish to get the project fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1683)|
| 0:28:12| Thank you. Mr. De La Bope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| John, I was – this last section raises questions about kind of the order of activity in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1696)|
| 0:28:24| And I realize that it's difficult to start a dialogue and then later try to acquire a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| because you've created a problem in terms of can you get it, have you scared off the buyer, the seller, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| But step number two of engaging the public is the one that sort of opens the door to acceptance or not of a 10-year plan facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1718)|
| 0:28:52| And yet by the time that happens, it looks like – I mean, the developers committed money and time and effort to getting the site to build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1732)|
| 0:29:01| So how do you – explain that a little better to me because it's almost like it's a fait accompli after you get to step two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| And I realize you haven't had approval of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| You haven't had, what, the completion of the public dialogue both before and after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| But this idea of going in, getting the site, and then a commitment is made in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| and now we're going to try to, what, soften the neighborhood to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| I mean, I'm not saying you're trying to do that, but that's the perception of do we have the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| Well, this public notification policy was put together really looking at some other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| and how they've approached this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| It would be very disadvantageous to a developer to announce his or her intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| and have a dialogue about that and then just go try to acquire this certain piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| because if there was that kind of need for it, I would say that there's opportunity for some price inflation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1800)|
| 0:30:10| So what we're doing in the public and when the public conversation begins is helping the public really understand what this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1810)|
| 0:30:20| and what it's not, how it operates, and then answer questions that may emerge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| And the public also would have, if you think about suitability, have an opportunity to figure out maybe they know things about the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1829)|
| 0:30:38| that the developer missed in due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| And maybe that would help the developer realize maybe this isn't a suitable site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| But by the time it gets to the neighborhood because it's zoned correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| and it meets the other criteria, the developer is looking at it as a suitable site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| Okay, and you don't see the concern that the community that's on the receiving end will feel like it's a fait accompli| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| and it's being kind of railroaded or rammed down their throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| I mean, that's the danger that they feel like they're under attack and that they haven't had input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| Now, I recognize the point you said, and I started with that, that it would be awkward as heck for Walmart to come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| we're going to build a store in your neighborhood and then later try to buy the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| They're obviously going to pay twice as much for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| It's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| So you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| I don't know whether you're working with options or what you're doing in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| A variety of different ways to get site control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Let me go to Ms. Palmer because I know I think you actually have some ideas on this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| At some point, and we've had so many discussions, I'm not sure which one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| but we talked about the fact that before a developer even looks at a site or a potential site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| that meetings be held with neighborhoods to get their input on potential sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| and then perhaps those could be shopped to developers or the interested parties who would be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| And it would seem to me from the people I have listened to more than addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| that this is a real issue that they don't feel they have any input in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| It goes along with what Councilman De La Vope is saying, that for the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| I understand the developer needs some, I'm not sure what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| discretion and this not to be bantered around to keep the price of the property in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| At the same time, the perception in the neighborhood is, well, here they are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| So I think we need to move away from here they are again to what are some ideas for some possible places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| And this, of course, goes along with conversations we've had about waiting to see the operation of Menvilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| and get some ideas and maybe concerns that people have will either be decreased or dissolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1969)|
| 0:32:58| because they see that those concerns are just not there, or maybe they will be intensified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| But I really do think that before a developer goes into a site or gets involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| that neighborhoods, and we have a lot of neighborhood groups throughout the city in every district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| and I really believe that we need to be having conversations with those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| before a developer even takes a look at a piece of property any place in the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| Because am I correct that this is also a county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| We're looking at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| This is not a city problem exclusively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| It is a Knox County issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| The plan is the Knox City and County Tenure Plan and Chronic Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| The development of permanent supportive housing up to this point has only been contemplated in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| because that's where public transportation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| And chronically homeless individuals don't have their own transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| so public transportation is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| So your previous point, it would be great if the developer in coordination with our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| had developed relationships with churches, neighborhood groups that said X site in our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2041)|
| 0:34:09| would be a perfect site for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| We're really partnering with you in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| That would be the ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| And, of course, with our efforts to get out in neighborhood groups and speak more at churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| maybe those kind of opportunities emerge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| and it wouldn't happen that a developer is coming in, quote, unknown to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| That would be our ideal approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Well, I really do hope that that's something that's seriously considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| No, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| I don't want us to be on council, again, dealing with the very scenario that Councilman De La Vope noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| that it appears to the neighborhood it's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Mr. Brown, is yours directly a follow-up on this or it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Then to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Councilman Pavlis just mentioned a few minutes ago that we're not informed until almost the day before a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2094)|
| 0:35:03| And Ms. Palmer just mentioned the neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| What methods are you actually going to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| And you're trying to inform neighborhoods around these particular sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| That's what you'd be focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| And what methods would you use to actually inform people so that they would know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| Are you going to newspaper, radio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| If I'm understanding your question correctly, if a developer had identified a site and had site control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| and we wanted to begin the public engagement process, how would we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| There's probably a series of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| One, just mailings, getting the general zip codes around there and do a general mailing to, I imagine, a radius from the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2142)|
| 0:35:53| Secondly would be a lot of these neighborhood groups have good email communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| so we'd get to the leaders of those neighborhood groups and get that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| And then third is the meetings we're getting ready, we would use all the public forums that we have to allow those to be known also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2161)|
| 0:36:11| I wanted to follow up on two points Brenda had or Ms. Palmer had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| It's kind of interesting, Ms. Palmer, what I envision you sort of suggesting is sort of saying there is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| there's a tenure plan, whoever, is proposing some housing in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| And a meeting that would be come and talk to us about potential sites, issues that might be related to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| something that says to a geographic area, we want your involvement in this, it would be focused on finding a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| That's what your suggestion sort of is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| That's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| But even before you're thinking about going to West Knoxville, East Knoxville, Northwest, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| even before you're considering a site, in other words, to kind of get an inventory from people in neighborhoods, church groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| other groups of places that they perhaps could be comfortable with in their neighborhood even before a developer starts to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2216)|
| 0:37:05| And that way when you're thinking about potential locations, you can say to developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| these are places that these neighborhoods have said that they could be comfortable with, they could live with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2230)|
| 0:37:17| they won't blast you off the earth or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| They could partner with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Right, and so that even before you're coming in with a developer for a prospective site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| you have a feel for the neighborhood and we're not at an emotional point at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| Great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| We're at a point of looking at this in a somewhat detached way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| But once again, I think that we need to see a year's worth of operation before we know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2256)|
| 0:37:46| Well, my second comment is actually on that, and it's a visceral reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| I know Mr. Pavlis has said this very articulately, and I'm going to try and say it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| I don't like the idea of having said we built facilities up north Knoxville where I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| and in south Knoxville where he lives and now we're going to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| It's a very visceral reaction on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| I don't like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| I do understand the thinking behind it, but it's something that doesn't sit well with me at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| to say now we're going to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| So having said that, other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| Mr. Dellivaupe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Let me jump on the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Ms. Palmer spoke about neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| I'm wondering if there are church groups that would like to see them do something as a congregation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| so that they have a piece of land or that they want to adopt a facility or anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| where it becomes kind of a tie-in to the faith-based charitable kind of giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| I didn't know what success or difficulties you're finding in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| but it may be that a church group could in essence be a partner in maybe even expanding on church grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2332)|
| 0:39:03| Great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Because I think when you think of a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| and you think about the key partners you want to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| you want to have partners with the churches and the neighborhood groups and then the businesses, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| So I've heard what Mrs. Palmer said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| I think it's a great idea, and to combine that with the churches, that's a great approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| I know that in Atlanta there are several very large churches, as we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| and a couple of them independently have purchased or rented condominiums or apartments or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| so that they actually own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| And it's not unlike the situation you have here with southeastern housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| building the facility and the people are renting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| but these are actually owned by the faith-based group, whatever faith it happens to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| so that that increases your inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| It gets the residents of the city involved, and it also eases the burden for the taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| because not only are we looking at the cost of constructing these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| but we have operational follow-up costs for helping maintain the level of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| And that has to be a piece that is considered beside, not after the construction, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Let me hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| We've got a process thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Council rules do not provide for a public forum at workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| Traditionally we've always added one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| I'm going to add that unless there's an objection to adding public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| If you're interested in speaking at public forum at the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| there's a sign-up sheet on the end of the table over here next to Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| And back to you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Well, at this point in the presentation, I want to move it from me to Brad Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| And this slide kind of introduces Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| Well, first of all, the plan is working now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| Over 350 individuals, chronically homeless individuals, are now living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| and have been placed in permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Over 300 still remain there since July 1st of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| And then you've got to remember in the KCDC high rises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| CAC has been wildly successful at case managing the at-risk population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| the population that really if they fall out of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| they're the front door into chronic homelessness again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| CAC has been wildly successful in keeping evictions to the street at zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| And they've almost been doing that a year and a half now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| So there is success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| The thing I think I'm most excited about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| and I think you talked with Mrs. Weatherstone about this when she was before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| at the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| is the coordination and cooperation among the homeless service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| And what happened when we began this process is we talked about every homeless service provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| having a designated agency function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| They could have a unique function, we could remove duplication, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| But it's a different conversation when everybody has a unique function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| in coordinating those activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| And so we're really talking about building a system that's really working to end chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| among all these homeless service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| and maximizing the resources that are already at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| And so 21 months ago, I laugh because it's been an arduous process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| we invited Brad Green to provide some leadership to this process of coordinating our activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2555)|
| 0:42:43| and really building a system that's going to deliver the most effective results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| when it comes to ending chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Brad's going to talk to you about his credentials, but what I wanted him to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| and Vice Mayor Becker and I agreed it would be interesting for him to get you at 10,000 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| and talk to you about what he saw, who he is, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| because you know he has experience in building these kind of systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| Secondly, what he saw when he came in and began to work with the homeless service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| And then thirdly and most excitedly, where the Homeless Service Provider Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| under Brad's leadership, sees us going and implementing the nine strategies of the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| and the impact that's going to have on the chronically homeless in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| Before Brad comes up, let me get Mr. Pavlis and then Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| Yeah, and I don't know that this is the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| I won't do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| Just because I know John is about to finish up his part of it, and this would be a question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| And you'd made the statement earlier about the county really not being accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| because of the bus lines and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| But, you know, I want to throw out the idea is that, you know, during this time that the DA, the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| all the folks that are looking at this county facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| would that be a good opportunity to have dialogue with them to perhaps dovetail with this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2640)|
| 0:44:09| It would be a good city-county venture or, you know, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| And, you know, does it warrant discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| The answer is yes, it warrants a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| The safety center is, of all things, mentioned in the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| And it is a component of the services we need to provide to have the chronically homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| in the inappropriate place to be housed, which is the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| So, fortunately, Mayor Burchett and his chief of staff have expressed a willingness to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| and talk to us to learn about where we are and where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| And then hopefully that will lead to continued conversations with the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and others involved with the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| So it's very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| We just mentioned about churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| As we go through this plan and this process, are you finding very much support from our churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| or is there an indifference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| What do you say about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| It may be kind of hard to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| I have a real strong opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Churches in our community are very generous and they give a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| They have been generous in giving their time in line with how we've provided services traditionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| We've approached this with a crisis mentality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Everybody that's homeless is in crisis, not with the mentality of movement and moving people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| And I'm taking a little bit of Brad's theme here, but moving people from crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| and immediately beginning to reintegrate them into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| And so what's happened is a lot of our churches are stuck in old patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| thinking if they provide food, they provide clothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| they're doing the best thing they can for the homeless in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| What we plan to do is give them new outlets to serve in more productive ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| And my hunch is if we provide them with those outlets and those forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| they'll step up and do it because, again, the compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| and generosity is overwhelming from the faith-based community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| Let me turn it over to Brad if you don't have any more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2778)|
| 0:46:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| It definitely is an honor to be able to share with you a little bit about the journey that I've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| that John invited me on about 21 months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| And I am really, really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| The question you just asked, Mr. Brown, is something that, as John mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| I think we're going to see more and more and more opportunities in the future for the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| and the faith-based community to engage in maybe some different ways than we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| I'm going to tell you a little bit about who I am and how I even came into being invited into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2825)|
| 0:47:15| I've got my clicker here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| And I'm going to tell you this based on really force-shaping experiences about who I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| and that it will inform you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| And I want to use these as I walk through the presentation to share with you how I engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| You know, I am a consultant, but how I engage my clients in the way that I choose to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| First of all, I did my education from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| I've got a Ph.D. in industrial engineering that I got in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| But I got a whole lot more than education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| I was involved with, during the mid-90s, the business world in America was kind of consumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| with Japanese management techniques and what was going on in Toyota and those kind of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| And I was involved with the College of Business, actually traveling around the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| helping companies, particularly American companies, figure out how to adopt those practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| I've got the technical background and all that's great, but what I kind of fell in love with was the organizational nuances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| of why people adopt certain things and why they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| So I kind of became a little bit of a change management junkie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| The other piece of my experience at the University of Tennessee is I was a part of kind of the golden years of Tennessee baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| I was there 93 to 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| And I tell people, during those three years, the University of Tennessee had the best record in college baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| It also happened to be the same three years that Todd Helton was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| So that has a little bit more to do with it than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| But what I learned in those experiences really is about the power of team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| And it was always interesting to me throughout my athletic career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| the teams that did the best were not necessarily the most talented teams, but the teams that knew how to work well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| And that's a big piece of what John asked me to step into is how do these service organizations that really give their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2955)|
| 0:49:24| the frontline people that give their lives to help people who have fallen into homelessness, how do they work together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| And so that's a big part of who I am and what we try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| When I left Tennessee, I tell people that my postdoctoral appointment or residency program was actually at Nissan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2974)|
| 0:49:42| which having studied the Japanese management approach, it gave me the opportunity to see it firsthand and to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| I was in Smyrna, Tennessee, so you see Tennesseans trying to adopt Japanese techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| So you see cultures colliding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| But it was really a place where I learned a whole, whole lot about transformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| I got my first taste of what organizational transformation is about, some of the projects that I was asked to be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3002)|
| 0:50:10| The next major shaping experience was when I left Nissan, I came back to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| and was part of a consulting group that led the CTI molecular imaging group, which is now Siemens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| the PET-CT innovators out in West Knoxville, through a transformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| And that process, when we started working with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| it was really about streamlining their manufacturing and supply chain processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| And we were able to take them from a 45-day lead time to a five-day lead time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| What was really interesting about this and what really shapes, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| why it's a shaping part of who I am is what came after that was they were the most innovative group in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3052)|
| 0:51:04| They're competing against GE and Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| And they were very good at what they did, but they weren't as good, obviously, at the production side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| When we helped them do this, it really unleashed a flood of innovation onto the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| And they introduced eight new products in a year and went from 300 million market cap to two years later, two billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| And that's when Siemens pulled the trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| So that gave me a taste of not, you know, it wasn't anything necessarily that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| It was really untapping and unleashing the potential that was in that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| And so that's a big part of what shapes how I work today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| Then about four years ago, I was part of a church group that went up to give Saturday packaging shoeboxes for Operation Christmas Child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3105)|
| 0:51:59| And I'm sitting in a warehouse doing my volunteer thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| And it's driving me crazy because the process is just horribly designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| So I went up and talked to somebody and offered to come help them streamline what they do because that's what I do professionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| And basically were able to take their flow time to get a shoebox from A to Z from four hours down to a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3137)|
| 0:52:26| I have six facilities doing five million shoeboxes in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| Now it's six facilities doing six million shoeboxes in 21 days, which is roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| they went from 166 boxes per day to 286,000 boxes per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| I tell you all this to say this was one of the easiest things I've done from a professional standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| And what it showed me and how it shaped me was that basically you can use your gifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| and talents to help more than just, you know, the business sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| So two years ago when I started Green and Associates, I started with the vision of combining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| you know, I still want to stay in the business and for-profit sector and do those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| but I also wanted to engage in social transformations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| So when John and I met, this kind of hit me right where I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| And so that's kind of how I got involved in this journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| But I will say there's nothing on here that makes me an expert in homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| And that was made very clear to me by the very people I was asked to come alongside at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| What do you know about homelessness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| And my answer is I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| All I know about is systems and processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| And I have, I can facilitate a design process for us to learn how to work better together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| And that's exactly what I've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| So it leads me to the next slide, which is everything I've learned about homelessness I learned from Robert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| And it's not Robert Finley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| It's got him, Robert Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| And Robert Clark is the gentleman in the middle of this picture here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| Robert Clark is a guy that came into Knoxville about 10 years ago, came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| was dropped off on a bus, went into a halfway house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| Five years prior to coming to Knoxville, Robert was working in the Pentagon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| Robert's story essentially is a story of a guy who was a national merit scholar in high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| came from a two-parent household whose grandparents were two or three blocks away from where he lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| Grew up in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| So he grew up in, he's really an anomaly in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| Went to the University of Virginia, flunked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| His parents said, you need to go to the military if you're going to be in this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| So he got in the military, in the Air Force, ended up in the Pentagon, and he got involved in drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| Five years later, he's in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| Ten years later, after having navigated the streets of Knoxville and the system that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| Robert connected with somebody at VMC and went through their program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| and now is the manager of Jackson Apartments and is trying to make his way back to Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| But what was fascinating about Robert in the CTI world, if I want to understand that system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3315)|
| 0:55:23| one of the very first things that we did with CTI was we took an order that was filled yesterday for a scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| and we just walked backwards through the entire process to understand how it got from A to Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| Well, in this system, there is no customer order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| They're people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| So I asked Robert in one of the early workshops where we're trying to understand how the system works today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| I said, Robert, could you tell your story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| And as he told his story, we filled a whole wall full of sticky notes of kind of the path that Robert took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3350)|
| 0:55:58| And what began to take shape was a story that looked a little bit, you can start to see the rest of these pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3358)|
| 0:56:08| He actually, as his story unfolded, we started to see this kind of cloud of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| and this somewhat of kind of migrating from one service provider to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| In fact, when he introduced himself at the beginning of the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| Robert knew just about all of the people in there that were service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| He'd actually been provided, you know, he'd been helped by each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| He was so humble in thanking them for helping him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| But what also happened was most of them weren't aware of who Robert was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| And it began to help me see that we have a system that is loosely connected, is loosely connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3399)|
| 0:56:48| And what you see here is Robert, we began to kind of replay the 10 years that he walked and where he went in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3408)|
| 0:56:57| And you started seeing someone who was learning more about where to get the services they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| He told us about when I was hungry I could eat four meals a day on Thursday at the different places across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| If I needed new underwear, I knew where to go to get it and I'd throw the old pair away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| He worked with just about every agency that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| And he finally stuck at VMC and went through their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| So what we begin to see and how we characterized this system was somewhat of, again, a tornado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3445)|
| 0:57:36| It almost looked like a tornado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| It looked like, again, someone who was somewhat bouncing around the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| And the cause of that is not that people aren't working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| I want you to understand the people on the front lines of this are doing wonderful things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| but there's a randomness associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| There's a connection with a specific case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| There's a connection with a relationship that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| And when that happens, we see wildly successful stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| But what we want to see in the future is that to be the norm and not the exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| And so one of the things you see in that bottom slide is if you take kind of that tornado and turn it on its end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3490)|
| 0:58:19| we also identify that there's basically four major stages that an individual goes through as they travel through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| if they move from the state of crisis of homelessness and actually integration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| And it's crisis, survival, stabilization, and integration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| And what you'll notice about those four phases is that one phase is quite a bit larger than the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3517)|
| 0:58:45| and that's set on a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| The survival phase is the largest, and the survival phase really characterized about nine and a half out of the ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| that Robert was on the streets of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| It was about figuring out where to get the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| It was not necessarily about how do I reclaim my life and integrate back in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3539)|
| 0:59:07| It was more about how do I survive in the state that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| And so this kind of became the battle cry for the service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| When they began to see this, what really one of the quotes from Robert that really just has stuck with me is Robert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| you know, if I hadn't had so many choices, I don't know that it would have taken me ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| And he didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| He didn't say that in an accusatory manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Remember, he was extremely humble and thankful for the people that had helped him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| He said it almost scratching his head, saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| and what I heard is if we designed a system that had a little more structure and was a lot more integrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| where the path of least resistance is the path that we want individuals to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| then the Roberts of the world would maybe not take ten years to connect with someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| and actually be on a path towards recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| So another, navigating the system part two, is another thing you need to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| This is just a real one of the techniques we use in terms of kind of mapping out how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3614)|
| 1:00:22| And this is CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| We were doing this at CARM, but we did it across all the major agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| At the bottom of that, what you see is a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| And the timeline is day one, someone walks into CARM and intake, they get integrated or input into HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3630)|
| 1:00:40| Day 20 through 25, this was an actual case, this person receives mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3640)|
| 1:00:50| Day 50, okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| I thought someone had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Receive a birth certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Day 115, housing application approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| And then day 120, if housing was denied, this person had to go back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| What I want you to see in that, and it may be easier for you to see on your screens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| the little green slivers across that line versus the big yellow blocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| the little green slivers are what I call value-added activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| Those are the times when the individual is engaged in some activity which is about progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| So of about 125 days, there may be three days where that individual is engaged in our current system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| to move towards where we'd like for him to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| And most of that yellow, they're idle, they're sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| And if I'm a person who has some kind of mental illness, the idleness and the sitting actually has a detrimental effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3701)|
| 1:01:49| on my condition to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| So we kind of have, by the design or lack of design of our current system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| we've taken individuals who probably need more structure in order to get better than the average person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| and we've put them in a really structure-less environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| So those were the major lessons that came out of the early stages of the system analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3726)|
| 1:02:14| So what are we going to do about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| Where are we headed with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Where we're headed is really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| To me, it is really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| And this is the vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| This vision statement is coming from the community of homeless service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| This is not the ten-year plan's vision statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| This is from the people who work in the trenches on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| We envision a day in Knoxville in which the condition of homelessness is rare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| but when it occurs, it's short-term, non-recurring because of the overwhelming support of the entire community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| to help one another find pathways to reintegrate in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| It's rare, it's short-term, and non-reoccurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| Those are the three things that are at the fundamental basis of what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| as designing this new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| So what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Well, we talked about the stages of progression in today's system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| A person enters in with crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| They enter into the survival state for however long that takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| Stabilization, integration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| In the new world, where we're headed, one of the things we would like to see happen in tomorrow's system design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| is we'd like to see that survival state either be shrunk radically or eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| So the days of a person having to go around and getting food and shelter really be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| And the way that it's eliminated is they start their path of integration almost from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| And integration, I'll share with you a little bit more in just another slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| but it's really about awakening hope to what could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| Awakening hope of what it could look like to recapture life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| and then systematically helping an individual kind of put those things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| The other radical piece and the reason that that square is about half the size of the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| is because we believe also that crisis and stabilization can happen in parallel to the integration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3850)|
| 1:04:19| to people beginning to recapture parts of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| So let's see a little bit more about what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| One of the core design concepts of our new design, again, you've got an individual coming into homelessness, fractured state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3865)|
| 1:04:34| They're in a fractured state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| Some authors are calling this essentially a civic death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| So they're ostracized from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| Their core concept about who they are is tied to their state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| It's their I'm a homeless person or I'm mentally ill, I have a mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| I'm drunk or getting ready to be drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| I'm a user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| I'm abused or alone or any other number of negative things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| This is how I see myself and it's a hopeless place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| It's where individuals find themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| What we envision is a system that's moving someone from this place of civic death to a life of meaning and purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3917)|
| 1:05:25| Intentionally moving from a place of civic death to a life of meaning and purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| by reclaiming or gaining in some cases significant roles in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| What does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| It looks like, and you can see that little sliver of gray there at the right hand is gray because it's the same gray as over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3937)|
| 1:05:47| Say I'm a person who comes into the system and I've got a mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| I've got schizophrenia or any number of illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| What the system needs to be designed to do is to help that person get to a place where that is a sliver of who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| It's not the totality of who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| And who I am is really defined by I'm an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| I'm an artist maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| I'm a brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| I'm a sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| I'm a friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| I'm a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| Or I'm a co-worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| And ultimately, again, this is the crux of what we're trying to design from the service system delivery system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| So what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Let me give you a little bit more detail of what that looks like, what this pathway to community integration is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| This is the same basic slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| The first part of this process is about awakening hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| Again, if I die a civic death, I have no hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| I'm walking into the system and the caretakers are going to have to have hope for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| And they do this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| They do this already, but we want to do this system-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Any doorway you come into the system, the very first thing is you're going to be awakened to hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| or hope of a life with meaning and purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| And hope, and they're finding this in the research over and over, that hope is the catalyst for recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| Hope is the catalyst for recapturing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| The second stage, and again, throughout the system these things will be created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| and there's a whole lot more details that John told me he'd kill me if I got into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| but as an engineer I want to get down and tell you exactly how all this stuff is going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| but we can get into that a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| But the second piece of this is empowerment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| and empowerment starts with allowing people to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| Allowing people to choose, and what's cool about the choosing process is not only does it empower the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| to begin to recapture some of their life, but it also sets us up for the next one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4057)|
| 1:07:45| which is self-responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| If I've begun to choose the pathways and you're building on my strengths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| that's another big part of empowerment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| then you have every right to hold me accountable to the things that I've chosen and the pathways that I've gone to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| And self-responsibility is a personal responsibility for my own recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| And again, you can see as a person moves from this state of hopelessness to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| now all of a sudden somebody cares enough about me to help me get to a place where I can be responsible for my own recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4092)|
| 1:08:20| It's an amazing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| The second piece, they'll help set goals for their recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| and the system's going to be set up to help encourage them to take risks and try new things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| because that's how they're going to recapture some pieces of their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| Ultimately, what we really want to help people to do is recapture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| or gain the meaningful life roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| What they've found in the research is that, as people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| there's an interesting article that was a study done in third world countries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4128)|
| 1:08:56| where they were showing that the recovery rate in the mental illness was actually much higher than in a country like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4136)|
| 1:09:04| And they discovered that the reason was is because in a third world country you're required to work if you're going to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| And so the meaningful role of working had a whole lot to do with the person's recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| So part of what we want to do is create a system that helps people systematically build these meaningful life roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| And we want to do it in community, which means in the community that they're in, but also with community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4169)|
| 1:09:41| So all that is to say, this is a vision, this is a goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| We've done a whole lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| I've worked with, we've got at least 15 agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| My last count was 15 agencies and about 40, we're probably up to about 50 people that have been actively engaged in design workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4194)|
| 1:10:02| to build the framework for this new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| So we've got a whole lot of work to do, left to do, but it's really amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| And one of the things I'll point out, I haven't talked anything about housing in this whole picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| And I so appreciate the hard work that you guys have done and continue to do with the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| But I'm also kind of glad that I've been able to focus on what it's going to take to help more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4224)|
| 1:10:32| And housing is necessary, but it's not sufficient, because you can put someone in housing that doesn't have these other pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4232)|
| 1:10:41| and they may or may not stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| And so I just, I'm thrilled to be able to work with the people that are on the front lines doing some of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| And I just want to leave you with the vision, the vision that this, that homelessness can become a rare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| short-term and non-recurring part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| So any questions that you have, I just threw a lot of information at you, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| Mr. DeLaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| I wanted to go back to one of the earlier thoughts, and that was simply, you talked about this fellow, Robert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| who was a merit scholar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| How did he fall into the ditch, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| How did he get to where he was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| It was drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| It was drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Drugs got him into the crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| And, I mean, that was a surprise to me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| You know, you kind of have a certain profile in your head of who these people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| Really sharp guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| He just made bad choices and ended up where he's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| Did he find a way to deal with his drug addiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| Oh, yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| That's been a part of his recovery process, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| And his faith has been a big part of his recovery, he would tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| In terms of the homeless population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| what percentage do you think sort of can be in an up and out mode in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| getting control of their lives and moving on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| There are some that are mentally ill and may never be able to truly cope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| But, I mean, what do you see, from your perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| of the ones that can be helped to gain control over their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| and then move on into this meaningful new life role that you've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| Well, first of all, I think it's all going to be relative, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| So even the folks that have low functionality, as we would see it, can find meaningful life roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| So across the board, meaningful life roles is going to be a big part of everybody's recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| But I understand where you're getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| And I told John, one of the reasons, you know, John answered the question, I think, Ms. Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| may have been your question about chronic homelessness versus homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| And I see this, again, in the business environment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| We may start to focus on one aspect of it's a product line or, in this case, it's a category within homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4381)|
| 1:13:10| But all of the steps in the process that are required to help a person who's chronically homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| are about the same steps that are going to be required to help anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| They just may, I mean, it's akin to you go to a grocery store and I've got ten items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| somebody else has got a hundred items, I'll go through the express lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| and the other person will go through the other line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| It will take more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| It will take more time for the chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| They just have more things that they've got to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| But the person with fewer issues, I think, can fly through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| And provided we have jobs, provided we can create career paths for these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| and they can be skilled and tooled up to go for those things, I think we can find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| One of my goals, honestly, is to lower the need for permanent supportive housing, that there's less need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| I don't think we can ever eliminate it, but that there's less need for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| that there's some people that we might today think these are candidates for permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| but in the future, as they begin to be empowered and they begin to kind of move up, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| they may be able to live in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| A follow-up question is, and we've had this debate up here with no resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| but you're in the industrial kind of management and process management, at least mindset and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4466)|
| 1:14:36| It strikes me as odd that we don't believe that some form of campus style treatment center might be useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4476)|
| 1:14:47| And here's the thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| When you're a manufacturer, you design your plant and your assembly line in a way that deals with each piece efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4488)|
| 1:14:57| until you move on to the next step and assembly and painting and out the door and shipping and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| You don't put shoes in a box or whatever it is you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| But in my mind, I could envision, you know, a 15-acre campus where you have an intake center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| and you go for your drug rehab right on the site and there's job training and other things as well as housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| and you have this way of having immediacy to addressing the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| But so far, we've been told that that's not a good model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| I'm just curious from an industrial efficiency standpoint, how you look at that as opposed to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4530)|
| 1:15:38| scattered organizations treating someone and putting them on a bus and then treating them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| I've actually thought a lot about the campus model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| We've actually got one of the guys, one of my colleagues has spent some time looking at other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| and one of the places he's looked at is the San Antonio model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| And the thing from an industrial standpoint, I would compare it to, and, you know, this is my background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4557)|
| 1:16:06| the automotive industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| When I was at Nissan, even as I was leaving Nissan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| we were actively moving towards putting the Pathfinder and the Xterra and the Frontier on the same product line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4571)|
| 1:16:21| Our domestic competition, our Fords and GMs would have built a whole plant for just Frontiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4581)|
| 1:16:29| Three separate plants, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| And the things, if you think about it, the infrastructure you've got to create,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| if I'm building the big separate plants, I'm duplicating infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| whereas in the Japanese facility and Toyota and Honda were the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| There's so much synergy that happened from the integration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| So I always fall back on worrying more about the integrated system design than the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4613)|
| 1:17:01| there's an element of the big campus idea that feels real GM to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| That's my – we all know where GM has been in the last 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| But the thing that I also like about where we're headed is the community assets are already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4630)|
| 1:17:19| A campus campaign would take an enormous amount of energy and capital to get it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| So let's just say that we're going to go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| Whereas we can create an integrated system today in the current environment by helping these agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4650)|
| 1:17:38| well, the first part and the big win that we have is getting to a place where we've got a common vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| we've got a common mission, and a common set of values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| And that's somewhat – I mean, if you think about the different agencies represented, you've got a big spectrum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| You've got different people, faith traditions represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| You've got different people on the political spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| We've actually come to a place where they said we all believe for a value system that this is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| Now, we don't know for a fact that San Antonio does not – did not –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| they didn't require any kind of integration at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| It was just a simply we're going to co-locate people and, therefore, that's going to happen by proxy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| And another example that I've used before is, you know, you could take an automobile part by part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| and I can put it in your driveway and it's not necessarily a car unless it's assembled together where the systems are working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4705)|
| 1:18:33| So I'd rather focus our energy on system integration and less on the campus model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4713)|
| 1:18:42| Well, I was taking what you showed in one of your slides that you were trying to take this crisis time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| and shrink it so that you get into both stabilization and integration and move those forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| because that was working your way out of the tunnel or out of the plant to the finished product, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| And do you see any better way of doing that, of shortening the crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| It's exactly the way that I'm describing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| We're well along the way to each agency saying, I'm going to play this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| And then the thing that's also got to happen is we've got to move away from cold transactional handoffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| to more warm integrated handoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Well, if you don't fight for turf, each individual agency doesn't fight for turf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| You're doing complementary things, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| If you're a drug treatment agency, you apply your specialty and don't worry about gaining or losing a client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| And I'm doing it with the same value system and orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| That's the real critical thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| What do you mean the same value system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| There's a group itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Every cog is working on the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| Same basic philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| There's a lot of philosophies, competing philosophies in the psychology and social work realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| And for a group like ours to come together and say we believe in this set of values is pretty phenomenal, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| I'm going to turn my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| That's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| Are there other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| If not, we should move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| First speaker is Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| State your name and address and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4823)|
| 1:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Ron Peabody, 65 South Gay Street, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Mr. Becker, what latitude do I have to actually ask questions of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| That's usually not part of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| May I ask for that permission from the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| My sense is that would be at the will of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| And I think it would be something we could approve to if there are no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| Our tendency has been not to do that, not to engage in a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| What is the will of council on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| I realize that this is a difficult topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| and that many people want to have the opportunity to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| and get their arms around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| However, council workshops have typically been an opportunity for various presenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| from the community to present information for council on an information basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| It has not been a back-and-forth dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| And I don't recall we've ever allowed that in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| and it would seem that we might be setting a precedent that could affect future discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| That would be my feeling as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| I don't recall any point in our past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| and a couple of us have been here as long as I have of us ever doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| A suggestion, why doesn't he just make his presentation and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| I'd like to have someone address this question as part of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Council can pick it up from there and possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| Actually, that has been done where people have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| I wish somebody would ask this question and we can choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Does that make sense, Mr. Wheelbody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| That's fine if that's what you all agree to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| Just a few questions, I guess, and I'll just present this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| I'd like to address some things that were said by Mr. Lawler earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| It's interesting, Councilwoman Palmer made the reference to Mayor Bloomberg in New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4943)|
| 1:22:31| stating that currently there are about 3,500 chronically homeless in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| The stated founder and creator of the Housing First concept is Sam Zimberis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| if I'm pronouncing it correctly, he created the Pathways to Housing in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4964)|
| 1:22:51| That is an ongoing Housing First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| and basically is recognized as the very first Housing First concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| and development in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| I want to make one point about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| If you go to that website today, it says that since 1985,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| that organization has found housing for 600 chronically homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| or formerly chronically homeless in the city of New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| Does everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| 600 in 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| That averages 24 individuals a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| And this is at the very program that is stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| and is referred to repeatedly in every basically ten-year plan in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| Mr. Zimberis has been a part of probably 60 to 70 percent of every study involving Housing First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5020)|
| 1:23:50| and homelessness in the last probably 15 years in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| And his program has housed a total of 600 chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| According to their website as of yesterday, I find that very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| If the focus, and this is some questions that I guess we'll just have to put out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5045)|
| 1:24:13| if the focus of this plan remains chronically homeless, I'd like to point out by Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5053)|
| 1:24:20| his original plan that has been developed over a 20-month period with the ten-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| was slated to be rolled out in June of this year, and it was called Knoxville's Road Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| The slides that were excerpted that he presented to you are really only a part of the story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| that was developed and presented to the TYP Advisory Board in December of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5079)|
| 1:24:46| It also included things like the revision of instead of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| they're going to start calling it permanent appropriate housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| that their intention with this revision, as they've currently said, Knoxville TYP 2.0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5095)|
| 1:25:05| is now to move towards facilitating the housing of the entire homeless population in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5105)|
| 1:25:13| Now that's rather interesting considering, according to statements of TYP leadership over the last couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5113)|
| 1:25:24| the admission now is that both at the Menville Manor facility and at the Flinnican School property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5124)|
| 1:25:32| they will house both the certified or technically chronically homeless, according to HUD guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| and also the non-chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| Now, as far as we can tell, that violates the agreement that the Southeastern Housing Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5142)|
| 1:25:50| entered into with the city of Knoxville to receive the NSP1 funds dating back to April of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| The NSP1 funds stated in the contract, and I can show you a copy of the contract that this body passed on April 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5157)|
| 1:26:05| it clearly says that NSP1 funds can only be used for housing projects that are intended for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| and house chronically homeless, according to the HUD definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| Quite frankly, I find it rather remarkable that Mr. Finley and Mr. Dunthorne have both publicly stated on camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5179)|
| 1:26:28| that their intention now is to not follow those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| And I think at this point the city council would do very well to launch an investigation into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| and correct that because, quite frankly, HUD probably is going to want that money back before all this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5197)|
| 1:26:48| You know, it's interesting this conversation continues to come up about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| why there hasn't been more church participation in the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| I find Mr. Lawler's comments earlier rather interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| He didn't actually answer your question, Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| The fact of the matter is the bulk of the church communities in Knoxville have not stepped up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5227)|
| 1:27:15| and put forth more direct financing and commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| One more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| To the ten-year plan because of their adherence to the housing first concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| They do not believe in sobriety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| They do not mandate it at their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| I'd ask Mr. Lawler and I'd ask the board to ask Mr. Lawler if there's been one church in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| or the county that has stepped forward and donated or committed to provide major financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| or land for the development of permanent supportive housing according to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| My understanding is there hasn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| You know, I can go on and, you know, I think that some of the things that continue to happen with this plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5273)|
| 1:28:02| things are said publicly, things are said privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| information continues to not be released to the public about this plan and the things they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| I think at some point this council will need to stand up and listen to what the public is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| The public is saying that this plan is out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| It is not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| And at some point you're going to have to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Next speaker is Dave Gartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| Come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| Please state your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5309)|
| 1:28:49| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| I'm Dave Gartner, 207 Lake Forest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| Could we get to John's slides, about one or two in the beginning, where he lists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| I'll tell you because I want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| It's a list of strategies, I think it was, in that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| The nine strategies in the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| No, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| Hard copy there, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| Six strategies, that's the very first set of slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| And we all have that same piece up here, Mr. Gartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| Slide number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| The comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| The thing that I noted was that in number one, you're talking about the 10-year plan going and talking to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5380)|
| 1:29:51| And in two, they're going and talking to the special interest groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| And there are barriers for speakers to talk to additional groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5395)|
| 1:30:02| And the thing that I'm seeing that I haven't seen very clearly before was actually coming in four, where, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5402)|
| 1:30:10| they talk about talking to people, using speakers themselves, using brochures, using the net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5410)|
| 1:30:19| And I'm beginning to see a little something that I hadn't seen before that they're using, and that's their ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| And I don't know how well this neighborhood advisory team is going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| and how well they're going to actually listen and respond to what the neighborhoods are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| I actually see this as encouragement, and I'm very cautiously optimistic that the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5437)|
| 1:30:47| and community will actually be heard by the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| We won't know until we actually see it, but I'm going to say I'm a little bit more optimistic than I have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5452)|
| 1:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Thank you, Mr. Gretner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5461)|

| 1:31:05| Come down, state your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| I'm Stephanie Matheny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| I live at 7717 Twining Drive, 37919 in Mr. Peabody's neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5474)|
| 1:31:22| I'm speaking tonight on behalf of Citizens for the 10-Year Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| which as of today includes 312 supporters of the goals of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5486)|
| 1:31:34| First of all, I would really like to thank the city, and in particular city council, for its leadership on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5494)|
| 1:31:42| I know that it's been a challenging subject, but I very much appreciate the thoughtfulness of city council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5502)|
| 1:31:50| and I particularly appreciate seeing many of you at the 10-year plan meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| and making sure that you're well-informed and listening to the community as well as to the 10-year plan office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5515)|
| 1:32:07| There's just one issue I want to address right now from what I heard tonight and that I've heard recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| and this is this question of delaying additional developments under the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5533)|
| 1:32:23| I think Vice Mayor Becker's statement earlier is well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| I would add that many of us feel this need is very urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| I personally work on the 100 block of Gay Street, and I leave my office every day, and I see the people that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| and I get upset when I think that through an overabundance of caution that we might delay building more housing for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5561)|
| 1:32:56| I think that we could look at this faith-based model, and I'd be happy to talk to folks about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| I actually have some experience working with churches in developing housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| I think that is a potentially fruitful future direction for this, but I would say that I think even with church sponsorship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5589)|
| 1:33:19| there's still going to be a certain amount of controversy, but I would urge the city and the county to continue moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5599)|
| 1:33:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Nobody else has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| Mr. Gartner, do you have a follow-up comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| Well, can we get an agreement of counsel to hear Mr. Gartner for one minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| He didn't come close to taking his five minutes before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| I certainly would make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| Mr. Gartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Something that people, when you're getting that discussion of delaying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| something that people seem to be forgetting is even though while we don't have experience with starting up of 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5638)|
| 1:34:08| residences, we do actually have some experience with starting up of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| Nobody else has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| Does anybody on council have any closing words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| I appreciate your attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5662)|
| 1:34:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100930?start=5670)|
