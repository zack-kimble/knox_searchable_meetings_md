| 0:00:00| You can find your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=0)|
| 0:00:18| If we could call this meeting to order of the Mott's County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=18)|
| 0:00:21| Redistricting Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=21)|
| 0:00:26| Thank you, everyone, for attending here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=26)|
| 0:00:32| First off on the agenda is approval of the minutes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=32)|
| 0:00:34| last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=34)|
| 0:00:35| I hope everyone's had a chance to look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=35)|
| 0:00:37| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=38)|
| 0:00:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=39)|
| 0:00:41| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=44)|
| 0:00:49| Under announcements, we've had some discussion about how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| going to allow comments throughout this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| And I think maybe the best way to handle this, and committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| members may want to do something differently, but I thought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| might be good for us to go ahead and have our discussion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| proposed redistricting plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| And then after that, before we take a vote, before I allow a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| motion for a vote, allow a comment period from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| And then if we want to have further discussion, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| But my thinking there is if we decide to change one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| two plans, and we have comments before we even talk about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| folks may not get a chance to comment on the changes we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| So I thought that might be the better way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Is that acceptable to everyone to move the public forum up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| after discussion of proposed redistricting plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| And before we make a motion for a vote, if we go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| Does that sound okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| I've got a sign-up sheet at the end of the table over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| If anyone wants to speak at the public forum part, please sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| in over there, if you would, so I can recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| I'll recognize you when you come to the podium anyway, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| is a sign-up sheet at the end of the desk over there if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| wants to speak at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| Does anybody have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Make sure I understand something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=132)|
| 0:02:12| Make sure everybody understands something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Let's define our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| We can approve 7A or number 3, or we can modify either one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=136)|
| 0:02:22| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| Is that our only options, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Or we can develop something from scratch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Those were the plans that we agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| I guess in a way, we rejected all the other plans at the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| I guess what I'm saying, though, that's the options we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| at today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| I believe that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| I guess we could accept a whole other one, or couldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| I don't have one, don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| If we get to amending some of these plans, it could end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| looking generally, it may not look anything like one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| plans, so I hesitate to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=180)|
| 0:03:00| If we go there, we wouldn't, but I think if here in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| committee today, we went that route, we could certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| I think the basis needs to be with one of these two plans if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| we amend one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| I think that's what we've all agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| So, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Okay, well, I guess then we're on to the discussion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| proposed redistricting plans, plans 3 and plan 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| I see the NPC staff has this plan, redistricting plan 3, up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| on the screen as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| Oh, and by the way, I'd like to thank them for putting the names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| of the precincts on these maps as we requested last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| I think that was helpful to folks, just to identify those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| more clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| I guess maybe a way to start with 3 would be, you know, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| we could just say what we like and don't like about 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| I mean, as a beginning, does anybody want to chime in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| Ms. Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Well, 7A was one of the plans we were looking at, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| takes 36 Gresham Middle away from the 7th, and then I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| where District 3 has put the second, taking Dainey West and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| Dainey Middle, and I do feel like, and I've gotten several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| calls and emails and all on moving precinct 36 out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| 7th District, because that is Fountain City as the heart of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| Fountain City, right there with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| So, this is a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| I don't know, since on one plan they moved the second over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| Dainey Middle and Dainey West, and it all borders, Dainey East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| also all borders the second, is there a way that we, 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| District kept Gresham and the 2nd District picked up all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| Daineys that would keep all that together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| I think Gresham has 4,693, and if you put all three of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=321)|
| 0:05:31| Daineys, that's 5,303, or we could keep Dainey Middle, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=331)|
| 0:05:39| think has 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Are you looking at Plan 7a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| And so, what you're suggesting is, is it amended to plan here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| that you would take 36 and put it in District 7, and you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| take all the Daineys and put them in two to replace that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| Yeah, and if that puts too many, because that looks like that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| the only thing that changes with the second in that plan, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| it's Dainey Middle only has 600 and something, and that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| stay over in the 7th if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| Because in Plan 3, we're moving three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| It's Bud Armstrong out of the 8th, it's moving Amy out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| 2nd, and it's moving Mackenzie out of the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| So, that's moving three commissioners out of one plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Do you want to see what it looks like to make that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| The planners, I think, can make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| Let's see what that would look like on 7a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| Because the statistics and the numbers are the thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| I mean, whatever, you know, our criteria to move this few people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| and the range and all those issues come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| So, let's see if we can see what that does for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=418)|
| 0:07:11| Tim, did you guys understand what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=433)|
| 0:07:43| I just like to reinforce the requirement, the criteria we set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=463)|
| 0:08:09| forth here, you know, lowest number of folks moved was one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| the things we were looking for, a small standard deviation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| which is a reflection on how fair the plan is, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| because that's, you know, every one person, one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| And then the community issues come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| And then, I guess, keeping precincts whole was another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| Is this what we got, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| Well, and, you know, of course, 7a has Thorn Grove and Riverdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| and I know that's a big concern also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| And there may be something we can work around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| I mean, if we keep Farragut together, and, you know, I'm not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=532)|
| 0:09:03| keeping them and I'm not saying moving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| I'm not saying anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| But obviously, that means all of us up above in the north are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| to be the ones to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| So we either split them and it splits everybody and makes it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| fair, or we try to work without moving Amy so much down into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| third district and moving us all the way out in the eighth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| or sixth district or however everybody's had us all going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| But obviously, if we keep Farragut together down the fifth, that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| all of us up north have to move big time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| So does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| I mean, will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| And then maybe we need to work toward Thorn Grove, Riverdale, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| high school pedigo or that power area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| I mean, if you keep everything, if everybody's semi-happy down west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| right now on this 7A in town of Farragut is the one that drew it, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| we have to make sure that that north area is as semi-together as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| You know, 50,000 people are going to be moving no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Somewhere or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| It just depends on where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| And 18,000 will come out of the fifth district somehow or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| I mean, those are just the facts of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| The change you just made actually reduced, I think it actually reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| the population moved, which is a good thing, from what we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| And it kept the same range, if I'm looking at this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| So I think we moved 50,000 some before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| So that actually, that's a good change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| I mean, if we're looking at those kinds of criteria, people moved, ranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| that was a real good, that's a real good change to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| You know, Thorn Grove and Riverdale, that's, I've also heard and some of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=657)|
| 0:11:07| friends in that area have made the same comment with Carter High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| I've looked at trying to change that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| That's harder to do because those precincts are so huge and those land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| areas are so huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| You know, at some point, we put 10S and 9 and then tried to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| tried to do some shifting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=694)|
| 0:11:45| Tim, let's try to put 10S on Plan 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Let's put 10S and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| That's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| From this revision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| From this revision, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| And you might save that revision we just had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| See, there's 6,000 population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| I'd just like to see what happens if we put 10S and then put 70, put Riverdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| and Thorn Grove back in the 8th District in Plan 7A, what that does to the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| Is 10S?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| It's going to make the 1st District short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| I can tell you that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| 56,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| But the range is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=754)|
| 0:12:55| So, that actually moved more people and actually moved the range up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| So, that's obviously not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| I mean, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| You said there was three commissioners that would be lost with the plan the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| On Plan 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| She's looking at 7A right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| On Plan 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| We're not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| 7A really doesn't move any commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| It did move Mr. Hammond and he obviously last time said he didn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| He didn't need to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| So, 7A as we have it here before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| Let's pull back up that amended 7A that Ms. Carringer just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| That was one of my main concerns, not moving any commissioners out of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| Current commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=834)|
| 0:14:05| Does anybody have any other suggestions on anything, any moves to make here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| We can look at anything we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| They have the software here to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| We have on the monitor that with Commissioner Carringer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| It's Commissioner Carringer's 7A Revision 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| Yeah, what we did was we put all the Dannys in two and put Gresham back in seven by that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=867)|
| 0:14:36| Rick, when is it going to be possible to, I mean, can we speak about this now since this is a new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| Well, what I wanted to do is let us have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| And then if we have, once we have the plans that we have up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| then maybe open the floor for public discussion on those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| And then we'll open back up the floor for discussion again is what I had thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| If we can come up with some plans that we think, like this revision that seems to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| Well, I can tell you that as the second district representative who is here, I am not in favor of that revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| And that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| I've taken Danny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Those precincts, I'm sure that the people there are wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| But Gresham has a lot more in common with the rest of the second district than those three precincts do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| I disagree because you've got Danny East already in the seventh district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| And you've got Danny West and Danny Middle in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| So Gresham 36 is Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Well, so is 37, 38, and 39, which are already in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| Well, that's Inskip area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| That's not Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| That is Inskip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Well, I think the people who live there would probably consider themselves Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| I know that they do when I go out and knock on their doors and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Well, that's called the Inskip community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| That's how I've grown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| And they had their Inskip ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Fountain City had their ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| The thing is, too, is already people in the seventh district that represent the county that don't have city councilmen to back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=959)|
| 0:16:10| We're already traveling like crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| So to take the second district straight up Fountain City into 36, it pushes us out further down into more traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=972)|
| 0:16:23| I'm just saying, I don't think we've done our best work yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| I'm just saying that there is a problem with this plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| I think that if we keep working on it, we can find something that's going to be more platable to a lot more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| We can move it down into taking some of the third district also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| We've already looked at, I think, 15 plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| We've come down to a point where we have some plans that move 50,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| The others move 70,000, 80,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Somebody's going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Somebody's not going to be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| 30,000 more people are not going to be happy whatever we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| That's why we laid forth that criteria to begin with to try to move as few people as we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| to try to come up with a deviation where we are more evenly balanced in each of the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| because we know we're going to get into this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| I mean, this debate the commissioners have just had is a good example of what we're going to get into if we're not awful careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| This is a temporary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| I want to make that clear again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| This is a very temporary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| It's for one election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| It's an important election, but it is for one election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Our statistics we have now show that we're going to have an additional 50,000 people or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| which means each district is going to have to grow by 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| It's going to be radically different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| It may be in a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| You know, this is the first time we've tried to do this in this manner, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| out in the public and discussing it in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| I was hopeful we could get a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Well, I mean, and this by me, you know, moving over and getting dainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| getting a little more west with the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| I'm, you know, the seventh district is still giving up Pettigo and High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| which probably have more in common with the seventh district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| I mean, if we want to say that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| And that's still taking the seventh district down into Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| Well, Powell considers them the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| So, I mean, I'm not asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| I'm giving up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| We're giving up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| We're being asked to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Well, you're not being asked to give up anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| We're being asked to give up the Beaumont community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| We're being asked to give up the Beaumont community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| And the second district on 7A, it just shows you taking on Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| We also lose Beaumont, Ward 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| Where's Beaumont?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Ward 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| That's being taken away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| Well, you're going to get something taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| We're getting High School and Pettigo taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| I think we're all going to have to give a little bit away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| and we all may have to pick something up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| But it needs to be done in a fair and equitable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| And I think that we need to work on keeping communities together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Let me steer this conversation back over toward the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| This is not about necessarily precincts and districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| And I know we have strong advocates here for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| But we're trying to come up with a plan for Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| And folks aren't here to represent their own districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| All the commissioners aren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| They'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Whatever plan gets to commission, those folks can then advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| for their plans or for their districts at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| And I understand that we have strong feelings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| But, again, that's why I wanted to get the criteria to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| We can find a plan that moves the smallest amount of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| regardless of where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| and comes closest to having the best deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| I think that, for this committee's sake, is the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| Because we're going to get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| 50,000 people is a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| A lot of neighborhoods are going to move regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| And they're not going to be – everybody's not going to be happy, clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| And so we've tried to find the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| We look at a lot of plans, trying to find the best plan that met that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| So far, the best we've come up with, in my view, moves around 57,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| And both of these plans, 3 and 7A, both do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| I just want to charm in here and say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Charm in there, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Charm in or chime in, whichever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| You know, I served 12 years on city council in the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| And redistricting is tough for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| And the purpose of this thing is to move some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| And we know there's going to be changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| And to keep every community or every precinct the same that we're in, it ain't going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| It ain't going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| We are going to have to lose some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| And I think 7A, looking at the figures, I think probably moves the least amount of people to get the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1257)|
| 0:21:06| Not everybody's going to be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| I mean, if I decide to run for something else, I may end up in the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| I may end up in the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| But somewhere down the road in two years, we're going to do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| But, you know, this is not an easy job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| And I don't know how I got put over here, but I'm up here, thanks to Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Because you're charming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| But, you know, we want to do the right thing for the whole community and throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| And I realize everybody has their preferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| But we hope that, you know, when we sit down and we make this change and recommend it to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| that we can all at least get some type of support because we are still in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| We've not put anybody in Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| We've not moved anybody in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| So we're still in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| So let's all try to work together and make this thing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| And I'd like to say, you know, in a couple of years, I mean, we'll probably learn from this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| In a couple of years when this comes up again, part of the problem is the way the precincts are laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| I had a discussion with someone today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| The precincts are so large in some cases, and they don't really, you know, reflect the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| They split neighborhoods, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| They do some odd things that are causing us to get in a little bit of a bind here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Maybe in a couple of years when we do it again, maybe we can, to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| we'll decide these precincts ought to go together or some semblance thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| But we're not there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| This plan is just trying to get something accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| We only have another eight or nine months before an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Well, and, you know, and I'm trying to be as fair as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| I mean, if I was just sitting up here being selfish, I'd say, oh, go for plan three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| That doesn't change my district at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| We appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| So, Rick, 7A doesn't move any commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| 7A only moved Commissioner Hammond, who came last time and said that he was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| did not, did not, did not mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| He's not going to run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| And he actually, if I recall, was in favor of 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1390)|
| 0:23:20| Mr. Doherty, you look like you're deep in thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| I'd like to hear your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| I was just thinking I was messing drag net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Well, of course, you know, the people I've heard the most from, as I've said before, well, at the very beginning of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| I said my concern was trying to keep as many communities together as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| We do live in a representative government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| It's a democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| It's a republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| And we need to have, keep communities together as much as we can simply because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| especially now with just one representative, it's going to be much harder to represent an area that has a whole lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1435)|
| 0:24:05| you know, like we talked about last time, putting Sequoia Hills in South Knoxville just isn't going to work for anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| And that's what my main concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| And, of course, because I guess I live in Carnes, I've heard more from people from Carnes and Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| in that area wanting to stay together as they have been for, somebody told me, 40-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| I figured it was probably longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| But that's still a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| And so probably that's the reason I've got all the phone calls about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| But, I mean, you know, we talk about moving people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| I'm going to start a firestorm right here, and I've just been looking at the map trying to figure out what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| And that is, you know, there's some folks who live in Knoxville that just consider themselves Knoxvillians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| and they may have moved around three or four times and don't necessarily consider themselves part of a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| But, obviously, there's a lot of folks, certainly Beaumont's one of them, and some others, Carnes and Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| I mean, Farragut and Fountain City and a lot of these others that very much consider themselves a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| And I'm a little more concerned with moving communities than I am individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| But when I look at this map, I have no idea where those people who maybe not are community sensitive are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| Does anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| I don't think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| That is the dilemma, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| That's why I think we went to the we tried to create that criteria on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| because I think we recognize that is going to be awful tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| And we're trying to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I mean, to come to that, you know, what are the limits of these communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| And the other thing I'm concerned about, because of the reduction of just one representative, the eighth in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1534)|
| 0:25:42| the geography of that is just going to be horrible for one person to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| I had a discussion with Mr. Armstrong, and I hope he has a good credit card for pilot or somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1550)|
| 0:25:58| He's going to be doing a lot of traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1558)|
| 0:26:07| Let's put 7A back up there as originally proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| Based on comments we just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1574)|
| 0:26:30| Does anyone want to try to make any other moves for either Plan 3 or Plan 7A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| Or do you want to try to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Just the 7A with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| This is the original 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| Without moving Beaumont or Danny or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Beaumont is moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Beaumont is already moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Not moving Danny like we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| It's back to what we had originally, which is Gresham in the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1611)|
| 0:27:06| Would the committee like to hear from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Go ahead and have our public comment and hear what we hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Yeah, I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| We need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Let's recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Let's begin our public comment period then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| And Ms. Sue Maurer, I think, has signed up first to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1637)|
| 0:27:26| Ms. Maurer, if you could give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| I'm Sue Maurer, President of Crestwood Hills Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| My address is 8824 Farmington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| I'm down here tonight because we are in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| We have been in the 5th District forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| We have three county commissioners at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| We understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| We understand that they're going to be cut and there will only be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Richard Briggs will be our only commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| However, because we are one of the largest and one of the oldest subdivisions out there, it's almost 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1675)|
| 0:28:04| We went through this redistricting two years ago when they decided that they were going to change schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| when they were building Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| And they took our kids from Bearden High School and moved them all the way up to Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| passing Carnes and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| People were very concerned and very upset over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Now we come along with this redistricting and we really do not think that it's fair to take a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| the size of ours and split it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| It's going to be very difficult to organize and to have various issues that come up to be able to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1711)|
| 0:28:39| to talk to you people if we have all these different commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| We really feel that we need to stay in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| There are other smaller subdivisions that you could go ahead and move that would not be affected like taking a great big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| And it does create a lot of problems, more so than anybody is really considering right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| So I hope that you will look at it very closely and we'll see to it that Crestwood Hills remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| I know I have talked to several of the commissioners, some of them are here tonight, about the concerns that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| And we really feel, I know that if you move us to the third or you move us to the sixth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| even though it would be only for a year or two, I know and you know that our chances of ever being back in the fifth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| two years from now would never happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| So let's be very honest and let's really look at the picture and realize that we do want to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| It's not fair to take and move all these people into a different area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| That's like taking children and moving them from one school to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| It does cause problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| And we are an established homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| And so we hope that you will consider keeping us intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| What precinct are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| It's actually six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Sixty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| It's the fifth district, Cedar Bluff North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Sixty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Can I make a comment here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| It is for some reason when they did this precinct and also I think it's, Sue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| I think it's fair to say is that part of Crestwood is also 68 East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| And what happened and I personally think it was a mistake when they drew that precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| They should have split 67 and taken that part that was east of Cedar Bluff Road and made that one precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| That way all of Crestwood would have been in the same precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| But what's happened, they actually have a precinct where they split a subdivision in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| And 67 includes part of Crestwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| And then on the west side of Cedar Bluff, it includes Belmont West and Gulf Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| But I don't know why they did the precinct that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| It didn't matter at the time because it was all going to be in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| And I don't know how we're going to settle all of this, but I think certainly when we look at this in 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| when we have to do this again is that we probably need to redraw the precinct line so at least wherever all of this ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| up at is that you have Crestwood, which is how many homes are there, 1,000 homes or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| Yeah, there's 700 homes there, but they've got it split in a precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Yes, I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| That's what I was referring to earlier, the way the precincts are laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| And I'm not sure why they were laid out the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| We can go down to census block level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| It's very costly to do that, but I think in 2012 we're going to have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| We're going to just have to completely reconfigure these precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| Try to make them sensible because this is one where it really doesn't make any sense the way they divided the precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| And it's just probably historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| You know, some of the geography, I think the northern boundary, there's probably Fox Lunas Road or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| But, you know, as we go on in two years or a year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| we're probably going to have to start this process earlier just to get these precincts lined out before we ever get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| I'm not sure now we have time with election on us in less than a year to do much of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| If I could ask a question, do you object more to being in the third district or the sixth district if you do have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| I mean, which of these plans bothers you the most, the three or seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| The sixth district bothers us the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Yeah, I totally agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| It doesn't make any sense to have that community in with those other communities whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| I talked with Karen Carson, who is chairman of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| And they went through when they were redistricting for Hardin Valley and looked at the overall picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| And she said she doesn't understand why today those figures are not being used in setting up, you know, this new precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| I don't know why they are either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| But, you know, it just doesn't make sense the way it's being done right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| I'll just point out the reason we didn't do that, if you recall, is it moved 80 or 90,000 people versus 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| The school board map did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| I mean, if that was in it, that was a consideration we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| We'll get, I'm sure, to round and see if we can fix plan three also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| But, I mean, Cedar Bluff and Ball Camp and Carnes and Salt Way, it's a very, very different area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=1992)|
| 0:33:23| Once again, with the community theme, that's another one I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| Next up on the sign-up sheet is Mr. Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| Mr. Daly, please give your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Carson Daly, 7508 Government Farm Road, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| And I live in the beautiful ninth district that nobody wants to be in, which is basically all right with us as far as that goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2027)|
| 0:33:57| because we love South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| Mr. Brown, no matter what happens here tonight, I got a feeling no matter what you guys decide tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| it ain't going to look the same come county commission time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| So, hopefully, that everybody will work with you and do your best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| I know you're going to do your best, but, I mean, it's going to give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| This is only, I wish there's some way you could just, I asked Mr. McKay just a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| I don't know if we have a law director here, why can't we just leave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| We have nine districts for this next election, but I don't think that can happen by law or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| So, that would be the easiest way to get it done, Denver District, but I don't think that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| But I'm glad I'm on this side of the podium and not on your side of the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| And I know you guys are going to do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| And, like I say, this map, when it comes commission time, I don't think it's going to look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Thanks, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| As to the comment as to could we leave it the way it is, I suppose we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| I think the challenge we have there is we have a standard deviation of, is it 50% or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| Fifty-five percent, which means that somebody would certainly file a lawsuit to challenge the redistricting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2109)|
| 0:35:17| It's so far off that we, I mean, we would get a lawsuit and we would certainly lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| I mean, there's no, you know, 10% is the limit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| So, that's the reason we probably can't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| I wish we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| And if we want to put our head in the sand, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| But I think we're trying to make a good-faith effort here to come up with something reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| Next up is Ms. Amy Brules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| Please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Yes, ma'am, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| Please don't man me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| Speaking on plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Amy Brules, 316 East Scott Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Speaking towards Plan 7A, which I've looked at all of these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| And while it's not ideal for the second district, it is workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| We hate to lose the Beaumont community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| In fact, if I had my druthers, I would like to keep Beaumont and pick up Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| But I realize that that's just not possible because of how the first district is and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| And they need to pick up people, too, in the way that all the wards have to touch and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| I think you and I had a conversation about that online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| And I know that Michelle and I disagree about this, but I feel like Gresham adding that ward to the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2204)|
| 0:36:54| does make sense because we have 37, 38, and 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| It's not a huge stretch to include Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| As far as another thing I want to bring up about adding Gresham versus adding 72 in 72 West and 72 East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2222)|
| 0:37:14| is that when you total up the numbers, when you add 36, that's 1,017 voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2234)|
| 0:37:24| Fifty-four percent are Republicans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Forty-six percent are Democrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| So it doesn't significantly change the balance of Democrats to Republicans in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| Whereas, if you look at the 372 precincts, that's 1,405 voters, 67 percent of which are Republican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2255)|
| 0:37:45| and only 33 percent are Democrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| That does significantly change the balance of Democrats and Republicans in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| So I would have to object on those grounds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2273)|
| 0:38:02| But as far as don't get me started on plan three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| But I do appreciate how difficult this task is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| I think, Rick, you know how much time I've spent working through this and trying to come up with alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| And I am concerned that we do what's in the best interest for the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| But I do feel like somebody needs to be looking out for our inner city districts, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| And that's a huge concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| No, I'd like to just thank Ms. Burroughs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| She has put a lot of time in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| She submitted some plans kind of late in the game, but they were good plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| One of them was very close to 7A, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| They were creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| I was going to say they were good, but they were creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| As did Mr. Leuthold and as did the UT students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Again, we've looked at a lot of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| I mean, a lot of folks have done a lot of hard work on this, and we appreciate all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| Next up is Mr. Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| Mr. Brown had a question he wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| I mean, obviously, it's nine districts because there's two at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| Of course, we all know why we're in this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Everybody that wanted to reduce county commission, I wonder how many of y'all are out there right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| that wanted to reduce county commission, come up here with a great plan and tell us how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| We would love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| He was wondering, because you've got those two at large, in terms of putting it in 11 districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| instead of nine districts, I'm asking Mr. Brown's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| I'm sure that would require another charter change to go to 11 districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| and you'd have to go back through the process to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| People voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| People voted to have it this way, so you'd have to have another vote to go to 11 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| I'm sorry, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| Dave Wright, 6930 Borough Road, resident of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| I'd like to say lifetime resident of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| As some comments have been raised, this is a lot about communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| I've lived on Borough Road all of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| I actually consider myself living in the Gibbs community, but my address is Corrington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| and I'm sent to vote at Rita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| So, you see, even getting voting and all that sort of stuff handled right now for people in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| we cover a lot of territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Even getting larger than that, the 8th District is a huge land mass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| and maybe before I make any more comments about what I think ought to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2455)|
| 0:41:04| everyone should realize that I was opposed to the process which has created this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| Also, then back to what I think it's going to take to satisfy me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| how this redistricting plan should ultimately work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| I would think that the 8th District, being furthest from the problem that is causing the redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| that the 8th District and probably the 9th District should remain intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| In other words, being the furthest away, the only thing that should happen to those two districts is that people be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| So, in satisfying the desires, I think, of the 8th District as we move forward in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| I don't think that I can accept a plan which will take people out of the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| but I certainly appreciate the problem that there will be people added to the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| Then, from a personal point of view, I know county commissioners will come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| With the 8th District being primarily rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| the thing that would satisfy me most would be other rural people being added to the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| So, I think there are three or four points there that need to be considered from my point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Does anyone have a question about anything I've said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| You said that it was further away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| You mean from West Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Is that what you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| I'm referring to one district having three commissioners trying to get to a head count which would have supported two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2561)|
| 0:42:51| Then, we've divided the commissioners by two and only have one per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| I view that to be the problem, the problem being that one district right now has three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| That is the issue, as I see it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| Also, I'd like to recognize tonight that there are people here from the 8th District that could have been going to an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| enjoyable district rally or monthly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Anyone from the 8th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| So, you see, even though we're the furthest away from a problem, we really appreciate what's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| and we would like to give our input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| I hope I've presented their thoughts and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| And there again, does anyone have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| Anyone have any questions for Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Next up on the sign-in sheet is Mr. John Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| Mr. Williams, please give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Yes, my name is John Williams, and I live at 12513 High Forest Lane in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| I'm also an alderman representing the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| and I admit to being one of the principal authors of Plan 7A that's before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| And listening to the comments, I really just wanted to come before you all and try to convey the rationale behind which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2657)|
| 0:44:27| we drafted Plan A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| And I won't make any bones about the fact that there are only two incorporated communities within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| One is the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| One is the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| And if I had my druthers, I suppose they'd both remain intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| But that's impossible with the city of Knoxville, but it's not impossible with the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| So I began with my colleagues this plan trying to achieve three goals that obviously had to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2689)|
| 0:44:59| considering all the objectives that your committee set before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| The first thing that I wanted to happen was the town of Farragut to remain as a single community in one district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| regardless of what that district was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| After that, it was crystal clear that District 5, with 61,000 residents, had to lose a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| The second thing that had to happen was District 9, which was only about 39,000 people, had to gain a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| In other words, using communities, using incumbents' current residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| using Democratic versus Republican consideration of each precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| using minority representation within each precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| we set out to create a plan that met all of your committee's objectives and affected the least number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| Now, in trying to decide which precincts ought to be moved around, I have to confess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| and I recognize everyone here's historical interest in where their precinct might have been for the last 30 or 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| But to be honest, it seems even for the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| one of the things that best defines the community is actually the school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| And I thought about that issue as being a primary driver for what best characterizes the community of Carnes, the community of Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2772)|
| 0:46:22| the community of Halls, the community of Gibbs, South Knoxville, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| And so, actually, we started with the high school districts as a way of driving our decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| for establishing what should go on in these other districts within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| And so, with all due respect to the first speaker, I mean, one of the reasons 67 and 68 were shifted to District 6 is because they are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2800)|
| 0:46:50| as part of the Carnes-Hardin Valley community, most aligned with Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| Likewise, though it would have been great to keep the 73 district, which is the bulk of Powell, within District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| if you look at the school zone, it's actually more in line with District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| We would love to have used an ongoing geography south of the river as defining District 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2830)|
| 0:47:19| but unfortunately needing more residents, that was impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| And quite frankly, with all due respect to Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| the eccentric location of his home in District 8 created a huge problem for us trying not to move him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| We would have preferred to use Precincts 77 and 79 as being better geographic moves for District 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2853)|
| 0:47:42| but with his residence sitting right at the edge of Precinct 77,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| it forced us to move more laterally to add residents from District 8 to District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| And the unfortunate consequence of that, which dismayed me greatly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| was the fact that to preserve the rural character that was alluded to about District 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| we then had to swing around to the north part of the county and grab some residents from that rural area to preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| And unfortunately, it expands the geographic boundaries of District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| So to my surprise, and let me add finally that we did our best to stay out of Districts 1 through 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2893)|
| 0:48:23| We really didn't want to fiddle with 1 and 2, and we tried not to have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| But once these shifts were made in the more rural parts of the county, ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| we found we had to get some people out of some of those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| And that led us into Districts 2 and 3 and just a smidgen of 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| And we made every effort to preserve the political intactness of those precincts wherever we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| Now, I didn't have the breakdown between Republican and Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| I only knew if they were majority Democrat or majority Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| And we preserved almost all of those as they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| And likewise, there was little or no impact on minority distribution in Districts 1 and 2 with the things we proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| When all the dust settled from what we worked on and what we tried to do, as it turned out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| I was shocked, literally, that we came up with almost the fewest number of people affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| that we came up with the tightest statistics among all the plans that were submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| and that it came extremely close, with a few exceptions admittedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| to keeping all of those communities intact, though some moved from one district to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| and no incumbent was affected who was running for reelection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| And so the rest of the decision-making is entirely up to your committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| and up to the commission itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| But I just wanted to let you know, in case there were any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| that all of these issues were considered very carefully as we drafted this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| And we tried to come up with something that met all those objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| and had the absolute minimal impact politically, residentially, geographically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| and as well as with respect to community representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3015)|
| 0:50:23| And if you have any questions about what I've said, I'd be glad to answer them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| Anybody have any questions for Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| Well, just a little bit of comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| I don't think he meant this, but I understand the justification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| and I was in support of keeping Farragut together from day one because I do know it's a distinct community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| But because there's an incorporation and a definite line there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| does not think that it has more of a community sense than many of the other people in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Because I do think that, once again, that's my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| And, you know, I wish, I guess you have no way or no suggestion of how we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3057)|
| 0:51:10| the situation with Cedar Bluff being in the sixth and all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| you don't see any way through your plan of modifying it to correct some of those problems or concerns, I guess I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3074)|
| 0:51:23| I suspect it could potentially be doable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| but you'd have to come back around to 68 and 69 north and talk about moving them toward District 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| and then shift around toward District 9 from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| which I believe was sort of one of the features in part of Dr. Luthold's plan was to move more in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| But that would be the only way because we made District 5 have the statistics it currently has simply by moving those precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3105)|
| 0:51:54| to District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| So to put them back into District 5, you'd have to find some major population areas to move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| And if the goal was to keep Farragut intact still, then you have a limited number of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| As you well know, it's an extremely challenging issue to try to come to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| And I don't envy you, once the new census figures come in in a few years, having to do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| But it seems that the notion of considering it starting at redrawing the precinct lines is a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3140)|
| 0:52:29| In order to avoid the problem that the Crestwood residents, for example, have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| I mean, I think some of those issues need to be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| Plus, I'm sure Farragut's going to turn out to have a large population increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| and you may need to establish more precincts within the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| I think that is going to be the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| In a few years, we're going to have so many more people, it's going to require more precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| I will comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| I don't know if the comment was made by anybody representing the modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| but we ran the numbers regarding the change that was proposed for Precinct 36, Gresham, 72M, Dante Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3178)|
| 0:53:08| and 72W, Dante West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| And actually, from a number standpoint, those changes were absolutely neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| From a statistics and population, it was absolutely neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Does anybody else want to speak before we begin discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| Please give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| My name is Kevin Isbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| I'm at 827 Kevin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| And I'm speaking also on behalf of what Ms. Morrow was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| We live in Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I live in the small section of 6080.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| That part is going according to both plans, 3 and 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| That part is going to be in District 3 regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| However, Crestwood Hills, like she said, is 700-plus homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| We have a homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| It's a voluntary association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| We have a high participation rate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| We have a lot of people that are very close-knit in that community that have been living there for 30 and 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| I have gotten, fortunately, been able to meet the people who bought these houses when they were first there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| We do not want to split Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| According to the Plan A, it's going to be split right in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| And if we have a meeting, a gathering, an association meeting or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| and we have an issue to discuss, we don't want to have to call multiple people to discuss our issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| We definitely want to keep Crestwood Hills intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| And to answer your question that you asked, Ms. Mauer, about preferably 6 or 3, I much prefer 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3290)|
| 0:54:57| I think the demographics in 3 is closer to what we are in Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| And just I would honestly love to stay in District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| We've been there since the subdivision was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| But if there has to be a compromise, we must keep Crestwood Hills intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3311)|
| 0:55:20| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Does anyone have any questions for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| No, I certainly agree with everybody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| How are we going to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| I'd like to just point out that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Fountain City wants to stay intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Barriott wants to stay intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Cedar Bluff wants to stay intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| I mean, everybody wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| So do we do something and put it back on the ballot to vote, to keep it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3339)|
| 0:55:48| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Well, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| We're talking about a single subdivision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Which is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Precinct 67 or 68 East?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| It's 68 East and 67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| Well, but I mean, when you say it's one subdivision, it's actually two precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Well, the subdivision currently in the entire subdivision is in District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| And if, according to Plan 3, it would still be intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3374)|
| 0:56:23| However, if we went 7A, the subdivision would literally be split in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| And that's what we're opposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I'd say that three moves three commissioners already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| I'm not arguing with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Well, I just wanted to give my point about Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| We would like to keep that intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Yes, it's a large subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Yes, there's 700-plus homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| But it's a closer-knit community than any other that I've lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| And with our most recent charter change, Mr. Isbell, as you know, you're going to have two at-large members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| So, you know, when you have a neighborhood meeting in the future, I guess you'll be calling your district rep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| and your other two at-large members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| I mean, you're going to have a lot of people having to show up the way we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Well, I just wanted to give my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| We appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| Please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Barbara Pelo, 8437 Cortland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| I really didn't want to say anything, and then I do, because this is a very difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| And I know you all are in an extremely difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| And I just want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| We live, I live, in a neighborhood which was split right down the middle a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| It has West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| It was split right down Vannisdale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| So if you live on the west side of Vannisdale, you go to school at Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| If you live on the east side, you go to school at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| And it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| I had four children who faced that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| It happened about the time they were in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| And then I now have grandchildren who are facing that issue, lose their good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| You know, it is a difficult thing when neighborhoods, I think there are about 1,300 plus residences in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3501)|
| 0:58:32| So you can see that it was probably the only thing that everyone felt they could do at the time with the population growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3512)|
| 0:58:42| But it is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| You can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| When we have a neighborhood meeting, we have four county commissioners that we need to invite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3526)|
| 0:58:54| And we hope they'll be able to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| So we've been a part of a decision that was made without any public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| And I know for you all the public input makes it very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| But on the other hand, if you don't have an opportunity to express your situation and your feelings, I think it is even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3548)|
| 0:59:18| So I want to compliment you for going into the deep water with the public being able to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| But I do think that, and see, we have two precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| So one group of neighbors vote in one place and the other group of neighbors vote in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| Now, I'm a city representative on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| So I represent everybody in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| I represent everybody in the city of Knoxville, the way we are structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| But when this is to be relooked in two years, please look at some of these situations and redrawing the precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3588)|
| 0:59:59| trying to reestablish neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| Because that's one of the most, I think, one of the treasures of Knoxville is its people and its neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3602)|
| 1:00:12| And as strong as the neighborhood is, so will go the district and the city and the county as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| So just my plea is just let's look at this when you have time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| And I'm sure you'll get a lot of folks who would like to have some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| But thanks for letting me comment on West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| Thanks, Ms. Pilon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you, Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| Anyone else wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| I'm Kent Rose, 6117 South Apopka Drive, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| I live in 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| And actually, I live in the where we vote in Riverdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| But there's one very important thing that we need to know about the 8th District, and that is there's two communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3665)|
| 1:01:14| in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| You've got the Gibbs community and you have the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| And both of your plans are busting up the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| We do not touch District 9 in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| We do not join them in land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| We don't join them on the street in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| As the reverend advises, we're not South Knoxville people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| And I don't have any problem with South Knoxville people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| But the 8th District needs to stay intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| Now, if you want a good plan on how to remedy everything, here's what I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| I would go back and look and see who voted for this mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| And I believe that you'll see that it was four, five, and six and probably number one that voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| And that's who I'd bust up and leave the rest of us alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| Please give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Brian Moneyhun, 5512 Dogwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| First off, let me say thank you for everyone who has put their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| and efforts in on this very difficult thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| I really don't believe that there's going to be a whole lot of folks that stand up and cheer for whatever you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3762)|
| 1:02:50| So let me be one of those that's probably going to holler at you one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| This Plan 7A, I live in the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| and where my children went to school at Gresham, if Plan A goes as unamended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| that would take the heart of Fountain City and put it in a different district than it has traditionally been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3791)|
| 1:03:20| And, yes, that would make me sad, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| You know, I've lived in that district for the past 16 years, and it's just, you know, part of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3804)|
| 1:03:32| You know, you expect to see the politicians that you vote for living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| and around Shannondale and halls at a Fountain City function, you know, at the Lions Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3817)|
| 1:03:46| And, yes, that would dishearten me, but I look at this fine piece of art we have hanging on the wall over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3826)|
| 1:03:57| and I'm looking at the geographical divisions on that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| We've got rivers and we've got ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| And to my mind, the county seat, which is really not much of a thing that people really consider these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3846)|
| 1:04:15| the county seat where the county's business is done, the heart of that, to my mind, should be the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3855)|
| 1:04:24| And everything else should radiate out in pie slices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| because if you're going to inconvenience and dishearten some of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| I think that you should spread the misery out and dishearten several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| So, you know, that's my humble opinion, and make it your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| Seeing none, I guess, committee members, we're back to further discussion on plans three and plan 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3895)|
| 1:05:02| Well, I'd love to, as I said, I lean more toward three, although I do see the big problems here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| And we've tried to fix 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| My question is, is there any way we can fix three to keep these commissioners in their district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| As I said that before, unless we could figure that out, it wasn't acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| I'm still very, very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| And I know I sound like a broken record for those old enough to remember what a broken record sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| But I don't like the idea that Cedar Bluff is in the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| Cedar Bluff doesn't like the idea that they're in the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| I don't like the division of that district between Palacarns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| And I say I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| I mean, that's why I've got the most feedback on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| I don't care for it either, but that's what I've heard the most about for people who are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| one of the problems is going to be most people don't even know we're doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| and they're going to be mad or happy after it's over with and too late to do anything, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| So, but for the people, we're hearing that the people that are close to their communities and commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| and activists, that's what I've been hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| And, obviously, I want to solve Amy's problem, Mr. McKenzie's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| And who else is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Mr. Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Is that feasible to do that using the third as a base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| You're moving two on the east side right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| You've got McKenzie in 31 and Armstrong in 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=3989)|
| 1:06:43| So we could try putting 31 back in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| I mean, that's the McKenzie issue and see what that does for the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| Again, I think I described this somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| It's a house of cards, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| We move one precinct and you end up with two of them getting off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| and then you have to move two more and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| But I'm certainly willing to try that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Let's see what happens if we take 31 and put it in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| Are we going to have more public comment on Plan 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| If we have an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Amy, you told us not to get you started on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4044)|
| 1:07:40| What we can see is if we can move around some of these sitting commissioners with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| and see what that does for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4065)|
| 1:08:00| The overall range, Mr. Strickland, that's what the overall range means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| What the overall range is the standard deviation between districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| It's supposed to be under 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| And that's the one person, one vote issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| So, ideally, I think every district would be something like 42,400 or some number like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| And so you can deviate either lower or higher, but the deviation between all of them would have to be 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| And this is 12.3 just doing that, which is not terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| We had CTAS speak to us earlier and actually said that was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| I mean, plans basically said don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| They said don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| They said we could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| But if you want to make sure that you would win any challenge, you would go under 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| Take that a step further then and put 10 in 9 and 77, 8 and 9 back in 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4132)|
| 1:09:05| Yes, get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4145)|
| 1:09:14| Put 10S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Is that what you meant, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Yes, 10 in 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| 10S or 10N?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| S, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Yes, 10S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| You might have to take both to make it come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| Then what you're going to have is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| Well, no, that may work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| I mean, it's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| No, that's going to be pretty close, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| Then we've got the biggie, Ramsey, Doerr, Kennedy and Riverdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| Well, that keeps that eighth altogether like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| On three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| You're back on 7A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| We're on plan three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| We're on plan three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| And what the suggestion was is to put 10S in 9 and then take 77, 78 and 79 and put them back in 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4202)|
| 1:10:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Which may move 57 back into 7 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| So is that complete, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| That puts us at 54,016 percent overall range doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| We've gone the wrong way, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| It's within the guidelines, but not equal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Yeah, it's the, you know, we're talking about moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| The closest we've come is moving 50,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| This is 54,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| I mean, it's 5,000 is a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| So, but the range is the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| I mean, that's where a legal challenge is going to come in if you're over the range is clearly the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| I mean, you know, 16 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| I don't know if somebody would challenge us on that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Somebody spoke to Gibbs and Carter in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| What about Fort Sumter and Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| Is that, I have to say I'm not real familiar except driving through the area as far as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| Would that be at all a logical shift into the 7th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| Well, I think if you tried to move Gibbs into the 7th District, I don't think our 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4285)|
| 1:11:33| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| We're talking about just Fort Sumter and Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Leaving Gibbs in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| I'm just talking about the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| You'd have to ask the 8th District people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| I don't know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| I think at one time didn't Fort Sumter used to be in the 7th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| State the question again if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| Well, once again, I mean, as far as communities goes, I know there's a very distinct one in Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| a very distinct one in Carter and some of these other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| I'm just not that familiar with 52 and, I mean, what is that, 57 and 60 Hills and Fort Sumter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4321)|
| 1:12:10| They're north of Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| So I guess that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| If they were moved in the 7th District, would that be a comfortable fit for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| or did they very much identify themselves with the Gibbs area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| I don't know that there would be much of a change in the philosophy, but if we're looking at head count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| who is going to come into the 8th to make the 8th larger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| Yeah, that's the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| So I would still, I'd have to stand on my principle, I guess, that I introduced at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| that the 8th District remain intact and someone would have to be added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4360)|
| 1:12:48| But, Dave, what we're looking at here was putting, instead of taking 77, 78, and 79, moving it to the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4368)|
| 1:12:57| leave them back into the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| That will be a plan that I will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| But you would also keep or give up at that point 57 and 60 into the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4381)|
| 1:13:11| So then who's added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| What number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| Okay, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| I just want to get a sense of community and try that and see what it does with the numbers and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| I mean, the computer will tell us about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Let's try moving 56 and 60 into 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4404)|
| 1:13:45| You mean 57 and 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| I never was good at math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| We're going the wrong direction on our deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| I think that's what I was trying to say a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| If the 8th stays as the 8th is right now, someone has to be added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| If Riverdale, Thorn Grove, Ramsey, if all those stay in the south side of the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4453)|
| 1:14:22| and 57 and 60, Hills and Fort Sumter, that's the 8th district right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4462)|
| 1:14:35| That's the 8th district now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| So what I've proposed, what I'm saying is my position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| is I would like to, as the 8th district is the furthest away from the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| to leave the 8th district alone and add something to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| Well, you've got 32 and 33 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| If we're leaving 31 back with 1, you've got 32 and 33 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| How many people are involved there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| I don't see 32 and 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| Spring Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| How many of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| You're westmost green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| They're not in the 8th district right now, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| No, but that's what the 3 shows them going into the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| You're talking about getting something added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| This would add 32 and 3 to the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| That might be an optimal solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| I wouldn't want to speak for those people, though, saying that they wanted to be moved into a rural district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| I would offer to you that maybe the rural district immediately adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| and west of Hills and Fort Sumter, whoever that might be, would be a better move into the 8th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4546)|
| 1:15:54| Petticoat and High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| That's Petticoat and High School, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Well, just the first one, whatever the first one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| Petticoat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| No, High School, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Then you've got to add back to the 7th then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Yeah, this is what you're going to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| That's how Powell gets in halls is doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| As I've said before, though, the 8th district needs, in my opinion, the 8th district needs to remain intact and someone be added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4573)|
| 1:16:23| Amy, you have right now Richard Jokely and Spring Hill, which is what, 32 and 33?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4583)|
| 1:16:33| That's normally called Alice Bell Spring Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| Yeah, Plan 3, I have to tell you, is probably the worst plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| I think that Plan 3 was probably the worst plan I saw in terms of what it does to the inner city districts especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| And, of course, District 2 being my major concern, but I don't like what it did to Part of 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| and District 1 either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| But it was a total disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| It would totally rip the 2nd District apart, not just the fabric, the community fabric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| but just the entire flavor of our district would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| It's adding neighborhoods that traditionally have had absolutely nothing in common with the 2nd District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| and taking away two of our strongest neighborhoods, which is Alice Bell Spring Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| who have a joint, like we're running into the problem with out in Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| They have probably the strongest neighborhood association in the 2nd District is the Alice Bell Spring Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| And this takes them out of the 2nd District and puts them into, and they're an inner city district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| or inner city wards, neighborhoods, and this takes them and puts them into a rural district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| It makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| And that's just one example I can give you out of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4677)|
| 1:18:06| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Well, I'm sympathetic to what she says, and it's typical of a historical fact that there always goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4687)|
| 1:18:17| between county and city in Knoxville, Tennessee, in Knox County, I guess I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| And obviously I'm a county person, and I guess I'm more concerned with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| I'll just be honest about it, you know, or I'm more familiar with it maybe is a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| and I've heard from more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| I think more familiar is a better term because I know that you're concerned as I am with what goes on in the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Your area of expertise is county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| My area of expertise is city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| My grandparents actually used to have a business up on Baxter Avenue and lived there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| and voted at Beaumont for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| I'm very familiar with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| But, you know, I've been sitting here this whole meeting looking at these maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| and I've been looking at them ever since you sent them to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| And I'm just thinking, how do we fix any of both of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| I mean, does it even?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| You look at it until you go cross-eyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| I mean, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| And no matter what this committee does, it's going to 19 commissioners who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| Yeah, but if this committee does a really great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| and really does its best work and sends its best work to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| I hope that the commission will respect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| Well, I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| But right now, I'm not to the point of making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| Either we set another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| Basically, we narrowed it down to these two, and this three does move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| I mean, it just, it's all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| Then you've got 7A and, you know, we're splitting up people, communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| I feel for Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| I feel for the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| I mean, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| I just want to do what's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| I don't know how you can, without splitting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| If we don't split down west, that means all of us split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| Rick, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Is there any law that says we can't fiddle around with the wards and precincts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| No, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| So the committee is just choosing not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| But there's nothing that says that you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Because of timing and because of cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| the election commission would have to send notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| And Mr. McKay spoke to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| How much cost are we talking if we fiddled around with like maybe two or three precincts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| Is that a tremendous amount of money, Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| Not to put you on the spot, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Could you do it by in the morning, Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| I don't think there's any law that stops you from doing it because there are examples of it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| I think the consensus was not to do it just because of the confusion it will cause among the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| To do it really right, you can't just arbitrarily, you know, start changing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| You've got to go out and talk to the people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| And there's a time factor involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| The real direct cost is running an ad in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| which could cost anywhere from, you know, 500 up to a couple thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| And then mailing everybody a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| You've got to mail everyone a letter that's been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| So you're looking at almost a dollar per move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| It's probably less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Whatever it costs to mail a first-class letter and get it printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| What are we talking, 50, 60 cents per voter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| So if you move 50,000 people, you're talking $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| Yeah, but that's going to have to be, that's going to have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| I'm talking about if we just split a precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| Or just, and just like carve out one little piece of a neighborhood that's in a different precinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| and move them to the precinct that the rest of their neighborhood is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| That's not going to cost $50,000 because we're not moving that many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| Yeah, it depends on how many people you move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| So if we only move, like, you know, 400 people, it's going to be $400 plus the cost of the ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4929)|
| 1:22:18| It seems like a pretty small price to me to pay for keeping neighborhoods intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| It seems like once we got into changing some precincts, we're going to be changing a lot of precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| I think once that door is opened, I'm not sure we could just change one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| I mean, if we're going to do it right, that's, we would, I think we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| How many does A.L. Lots, 69 North, 8,438?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4958)|
| 1:22:49| And then our two Cedar Bluffs, 67, 68 East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4969)|
| 1:22:57| If you put those two together, is A.L. Lots going to crucify us if we move them over into the fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4977)|
| 1:23:09| to get the Cedar Bluff back in the fifth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4989)|
| 1:23:18| On which plane are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| That's on 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=4999)|
| 1:23:27| Please don't anybody from A.L. Lots get mad or if Mr. VanGilder puts in the shop or whatever next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| This is only suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| I'm for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| And Amy and I are good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| And we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| We're just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| The issue there will be if you move 69 in to the fourth, and you move 67 back to the fifth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5032)|
| 1:24:00| and the sixth still has to gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| I mean, you just start the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Sixth has to gain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| Yes, sixth, they don't have to gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| And third would have to gain because you're leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| Are you all doing this off of Plan 7A or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| This is on 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Because 3 just seems to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| it's moving three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| I mean, let's, I don't see how we can tweak three unless we go down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| and we split up districts four and five and a little more six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| I mean, in order to put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| The other issue with three is what Ms. Paroles has suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I mean, it really does do a lot of things to the first, second, third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| That's never been one of my, that's never been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| That is, I think that's almost impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| I mean, and that one is fair to the seventh district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| I should love it and I should be up here praising it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| But I'm a fair person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| I want to make as many people happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| But, you know, people voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| You know, we were talking about how we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| I hate to be, I hate to even say this because I was hoping this was our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| Not that I haven't enjoyed the company and the activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| You know, I said last time that, I mean, I like three the best because of what it does in some of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| the rims around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| Me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| At the same time, though, I also said it wasn't acceptable unless we had a way to keep these commissioners in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5127)|
| 1:25:35| So to keep my word, I can't vote for that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| On the other hand, I really just, the idea, once again, of Cards and Pal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5138)|
| 1:25:47| and that whole area that has a culture of its own kind of in between the rural area and the West Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| and you're having Cedar Bluff put in it, which is definitely West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| and having the, you know, things split up and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| Right now, I don't think I can vote for either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| I was hoping we could find some modifications of one of them that could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| Maybe you all can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| I'm right there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| I'm against both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| He's against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| He wants to move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Tank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| What's your suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| But this is very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| This is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| I think my solution is 7A is the most logical one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| It messes a lot of people up, and a lot of people ain't going to be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| But we didn't come here, I guess, to make people happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| We come here to do a job, and it's not going to be an easy job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| And I think what 7A does is it does it equally, and it does mess up some of the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| But I think 7A is the one we've got to go with, with the least amount of district commissioners messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5212)|
| 1:27:00| And next year, or in 2011, it's going to change again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| And I know Ms. Mallory doesn't like the idea that, you know, if you get in one district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| you may not get back in it when you get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| I hope I'm not on it when they start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| But I think 7A is the most logical plan at this time, I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| I would just question one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| I think there's some of us here who are commissioners and some of us here who aren't commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| And I think, obviously, from the discussions we've had from day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| commissioners have a different perspective on this than non-commissioners because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| obviously, for every good reason, this isn't a criticism at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| but for every good reason in the world, y'all are concerned about your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| and you're concerned about your other fellow commissioners' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| If you take somebody out of the district, you're gerrymandering, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| and nobody wants that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| And then I'm still more concerned with the community aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| although, once again, I think if you move commissioners around, you're gerrymandering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| Maybe not on purpose, but, I mean, you just these people were elected by their citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| and you can't just kick them out of the, you know, that district and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| I think it's just a very, very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| Of course, Tank made the point last time, and I think maybe Michelle did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| that when we get commissioned, it's going to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| It's still up to us to do the best job we can and to offer the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| I would, I mean, I would love to somebody come up with a suggestion that would solve the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| on either one of these plans, and I'd love to vote for one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| Right now, I don't think I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| Well, I feel the same way you do, and I agree with Ivan, but I don't feel like coming from this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5319)|
| 1:28:48| if we send 7A to county commissioners, they're going to chew it all to pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| I know you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| But they've got rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| We've got rules to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| They may chew it up, but they're going to have to, whatever they chew up is going to have to be spit out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| That's the same criteria that we've got as far as the deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| It's got to be the figurative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Tank, how do you feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| I mean, I would make a motion that we make, that we take 7A, and if we want to meet again as a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| I mean, everyone, I mean, I've been looking at it and looking at it, and like I said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| I was throwing out the dainies to, you know, Amy and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| I mean, there's probably some other options if we looked at this one map and stuck to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5368)|
| 1:29:36| If we want to meet again as a committee before we send it on to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| I mean, our next meeting is not until the end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| So even if we met again, say, next week as a committee, I mean, I hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5383)|
| 1:29:50| But, I mean, at the same time, I don't feel comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| I mean, I'd like for the very best to actually feel pretty halfway or 90% pretty good about sending this on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5395)|
| 1:30:03| commission, and the way it is, I don't want to cause any more problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| Maybe we can have a recall and go back to 19 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| I wish we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Can I just make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Two comments, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| Number one, comment to the question, you guys are not under the gun to have this done by the 4th of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5424)|
| 1:30:34| You're not, you don't have a time constraint here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| And there's still room, and I see a lot of tweaking that can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| and it's just going to take some time to do that tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| My question would be to the guys out here operating the machinery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| I'm sure that they have probably done some tweaking on some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Have they come up with anything that works any better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| Mr. Brown, they pretty much work with me, and we've come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| I mean, I'm sure that they play with these in their sleep, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| And they have shared with me their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| I mean, we've collectively tried to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| I mean, we've heard these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| I've had the same phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| I'm not a commissioner, but I've had phone calls and discussions, and we've tried to figure out ways to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| That's my only concern about, you know, meeting again on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| We've done an awful lot, unless someone really knows or has a way to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| I know we have, but, you know, a miracle is still out there, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| Mr. McKay, when do we go back in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| When do they start qualifying for the county office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| In November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| I want to say it's November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| That early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| See, we have to be finished by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| You can pick up your petition in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| That's what I thought, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| But we have to be finished in a couple of months, three months, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| It doesn't look like, just tonight, it's kind of discouraging to me that we've tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| I mean, I know we haven't tried everything, but we've not even come close to fixing any of the objections yet, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| I mean, it's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| And maybe there's, I don't know if there's no way to do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| And let me say, I don't want to be an obstructionist, although I certainly have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| But I'll be glad to abstain if you want to take a vote and move this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| I'm not sure there's much hope of, maybe you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| It might take a miracle to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| I just, with a good conscience, I mean, I gave my word that I wouldn't support the number three if we couldn't fix the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5553)|
| 1:32:42| you know, not to put them out of their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| And yet, I still feel very, very uncomfortable with what this does to northwest Knox County and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| Well, I'd like to make a motion that we as a community meet one more time, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5571)|
| 1:32:59| and seriously look at all this because the people that are out in the audience are the people that I really have to listen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| They've taken their time out and they've come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| I appreciate the Cedar Bluff people and obviously the 8th District people, Thorn Grove, Riverdale, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5589)|
| 1:33:18| Amy's concerns, everybody's concerns that I don't feel comfortable with the community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| I'm maybe thinking there might be one other possible few little tweaking things that we might could do before we send it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| That's just my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| I'll make a motion that we meet again next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| No, not next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Too early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| I'm on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Oh, next week you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| What's that next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| The fourth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| How about that next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| I might be out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| If we do that, should we not reopen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| I hate to even say this, but should we not reopen for people to send in new plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| I think I'd be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| You just want to keep this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| I just want to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| I would like to say, if we do have another meeting, I know a lot of people have come up with some good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| Some good plans, some good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| Mr. Williams, several other people have spoken tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| You know, if you do have something you think might work, call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| Let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Let the chairman know and hope we can work it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| But, you know, I think you're all going to end up just like we are up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| You know, we're going to be sitting here twiddling our fingers and trying to count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| And when you look up, it says 59,000 people moved and you're at 18% overall range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| That's what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| It's throwing us out of the range and we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| We've got to get in that range and 7A does that, even though it makes a lot of people unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| I mean, I hope it's not a lot of people unhappy, but it's just something we've got to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| So if we meet again, I'm afraid we're going to end up doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| Maybe that miracle will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| But if anybody's got a miracle out there in your pocket, bring it to us because we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| We have a motion on the floor to meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| In a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Do I have a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| Lloyd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| We're not pushed to no time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| We want to give everybody an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| Well, I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| We still have a little time to work on it and we need to make sure that we have put our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5726)|
| 1:35:33| and we've listened to the community groups and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| That we meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| That we meet again to discuss Plan 7A or Plan 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| I think 7A and anybody that contacts the committee with any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| And I'd like to also, if it's not in that motion, to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| I know MPC's worked hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| And they're the ones that has the computer expertise to look at this and try to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5758)|
| 1:36:05| I think they've heard what people are asking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| And if they can look at any of the arrangements to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| I mean, you know, we appreciate y'all's effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| I know you've done your effort, but, you know, you may have that miracle in your pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| I'd just like to say one thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| The planning commission is in a difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| They don't want to be in the position of trying to say this neighborhood goes in this district or that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| So we have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| I'll put them in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| Even suggesting such a thing because somebody could come back on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| So if you would like, I'll try to work with them as we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| And I want to say, too, I don't really see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| I realize there's more people that like 7A than 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| And I think both of them are very, very flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| But at the same time, if we're going to give time to try to come up with a solution, why would we limit it to one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5810)|
| 1:36:57| I mean, I think there's some, I mean, probably if we're going to get everybody going to vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| and I'm not sure if everybody will, it's going to have to be a combination of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| And so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| I would second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| But I think we ought to still hold both plans open to input from people and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5828)|
| 1:37:15| And I think we ought to give ourselves as much time as possible to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| Rick, I would like to say just one thing, and it's not going to be magic or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| But why don't you talk with the school board about their figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| Because I think that might help you because they went through this with redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| And this may be very helpful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| It may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| But I think it would certainly be worthwhile talking to them to see if they could help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| And we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| We've looked at their numbers already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| And, actually, we drafted a plan based on their numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| But it moved 80,000 people versus 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| So it moved a lot more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| I mean, we could reopen that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| What was their range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| The range was within the ten percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| It was eight or nine percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| And we could open it back up to review some of those other plans still if you all would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| I think we probably need to look at the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| If it moves 80,000, it might be the way we might have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| Also, Mr. McKay, the gentleman brought up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| I would like to really see who voted for this, to move it to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| What precincts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| And which ones didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| I mean, the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| Good boy, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| We have a, on our website, there's a breakdown by precincts, how everybody voted on each issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| If you want to check that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| I'll call you tomorrow and find out how to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| The computer wouldn't bring it up the last time for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| One of those city computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| We're poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| To answer your question earlier, November 20th is the first day to pick up a petition for the 2010 elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| And February 18th is the qualifying deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| So, but, yeah, we'll get you, I'll get you that tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Is the school board districts based on the number of children in that district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| It's based on total population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| Not necessarily the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Not necessarily the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Chairman, can you take, let's take out of the motion about the MPC input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| That puts them in a difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Well, I didn't want them to give us a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| I just wanted them to configure with it, but give it to you or somebody and we can say we want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| I'll work with them to try to look at the two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| I don't want to put them on the spot either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| And we've done this before, but we'll try it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| Take MPC out and put me and Rick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| Well, you know, I mean, honestly, you know, members of the committee need to do some work on these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| We've, I've drafted ten of them and, I mean, as a committee, we need to do some more work on these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5986)|
| 1:39:55| Some other folks that have some other considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| And, you know, the town of Fairgate submitted a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| It met our criteria as far as I saw it without looking at neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| I mean, it's the lowest number of folks, had the lowest deviation of any plan we've ever had in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| Which is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| You know, 4.91% standard deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| We've never in Knox County history had a plan anywhere near that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| They come that close to being equal as far as districts go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| So just to point out those few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| I mean, I know there's a lot of flaws with it, but statistically it is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| And otherwise, the only thing we're going to do is, you know, we'll try to correct Crestwood Hills and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6031)|
| 1:40:38| And then those other 50,000 people are going to come out of the woodwork and say, well, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| It's going to be tough to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| That's the dilemma we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| But I'm certainly willing to meet again and set another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| And Mr. Daugherty, I think, has suggested maybe meeting later rather than sooner to give more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| I mean, obviously we've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| That's probably accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| I mean, maybe in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| I've looked at these until my eyes are crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| And I'm just going to say I'm just obviously not doing very well with it, you know, I mean, myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| And so, I mean, I don't know what else it helps except more input and more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| Let's maybe make a substitute motion to review plans 3, plan 7A, and the school board plan, all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6074)|
| 1:41:22| Bring those back up next time for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| And if all of us would take the time to look at those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| I think we all have copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| They're all on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| And see if there's some adjustments that can be made based on what we've heard here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| So when we come back, we'll all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| And we'll get from Tank the people that actually wanted to reduce county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| That's on the election commission website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| Anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| I mean, I don't know that I want to put the burden on Mr. Strickland, but we can all do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| If you have Internet access, it's out there for anyone to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| He may want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| But if that's a consideration for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| Sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| I would just like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| He just brought up a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| Is there a second to my amendment to hear all three plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| We all second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| We say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| Are you ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| Are we talking about two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| So let's meet again in about two to four weeks, whenever we can get this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| I think it's important to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Second week, third week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Two weeks or four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Three weeks or four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6152)|

| 1:42:39| Preferably in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| Is 630 a good time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Again, was that good for folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| Is later better or earlier for the ones that are here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| Is 630 good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| We'll make it 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| We'll try in three weeks or so, based on the availability of the room and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| I'd like to just say how grateful I am to actually get some in-person input this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| We haven't had that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| I have called people, shown them the maps and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| I'm sure everybody else has, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090623special?start=6191)|
