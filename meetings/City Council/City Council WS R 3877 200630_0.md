| 0:01:36| Councilman figure is logged in but she can't see or hear her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=96)|
| 0:01:42| Okay, hopefully she can. She can see us, I will text her just to ensure that while we're, while we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| Thank you everyone for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| We're going to proceed with the agenda for the parties that will be presenting to us you each will be allowed no more than 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=112)|
| 0:02:01| We would ask you to keep it to 20 minutes or less in your presentation to counsel which might allow us more time to ask questions and have more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=121)|
| 0:02:11| We'll start with law director Swanson, if you would please speak to us briefly about the process for charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=131)|
| 0:02:22| Thank you, Madam Vice Mayor, appreciate the opportunity to share with you a little bit of information about the process that can be utilized to amend the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=142)|
| 0:02:34| I have to confess I was called a little by surprise by this request is, I wasn't aware of any proposal to amend the charter this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=154)|
| 0:02:44| Until last week, and I wasn't aware of this particular workshop until after five o'clock last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| So we're a little bit behind a ball for amending the charter this year, but at least at this point, it does remain possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=171)|
| 0:03:00| As I'm sure all of you know, the city of Knoxville is a home rule municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| And for any home rule municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| The charter only can be finally amended by a local referendum, that means a vote there's got to be a vote by the by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=191)|
| 0:03:20| That is approved by the voters of the particular municipality involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| And that referendum can be invoked in any one of multiple ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| The three ways that you can invoke the referendum. Number one is by passage of an ordinance by the governing body of the municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=211)|
| 0:03:41| Number two by charter commission elected by the qualified voters of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| And thirdly, by a commission of seven members, which would be chosen at large pursuant to the petition signed by not less than 10% of the voters of the home rule municipality voting in the last general municipal election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=229)|
| 0:04:06| So in this case, I think what we're talking about in terms of the method where the process is initiated by adoption of an ordinance by you all as the governing body of this municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=246)|
| 0:04:21| State law does speak directly to the requirements for adopting an ordinance calling for a local referendum, resulting in amendment to the charter of a home rule municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=261)|
| 0:04:33| TCA section six dash 53 dash 105 in particular provides that unless there's been a petition signed by at least 10% of the number of voters who cast ballots in the last municipal election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=273)|
| 0:04:48| There must be an ordinance approved by two thirds vote of the local governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| That means, of course, in order to adopt an ordinance calling for a charter change in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| It's going to have to have an affirmative vote of at least six members of city council, rather than that simple majority of five that you're accustomed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=301)|
| 0:05:11| So just be aware of that you need six votes to change the charter ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| State law at TCA section two dash three dash 204 also requires that the election commission has to be notified of a referendum between 75 and 90 days prior to the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=318)|
| 0:05:37| So a charter change referendum may only be held during a year and a with a general state election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| General state elections are held in August, and in November, even number of years, we don't have a general state election in odd numbered years, so you can only amend your charter through the ordinance process, every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=345)|
| 0:06:03| And that would be your even numbered years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| The ordinance which proposes the charter has to be published in a newspaper of general circulation, at least 60 days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=366)|
| 0:06:18| There's a window where you've got to let the election commission know between 75 and 90 days before, and it's got to be published in a newspaper of general circulation, at least 60 days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=378)|
| 0:06:33| So it's really too late at this point to contemplate getting a charter amendment ordinance on the ballot for the August primary election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=393)|
| 0:06:44| That means it has to go on for the November ballot if it goes on at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| And this year, that election day, as you probably already all know, is November the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| So, if the election commission is to be notified between 75 and 90 days prior to the election, that means the ordinance will have to be finally adopted no later than the August 11 City Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=414)|
| 0:07:10| That would allow the election commission to be notified 83 days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| If it didn't pass until the August 25 meeting, if you waited another meeting beyond that, that would only allow 69 or 70 days depending on how you count, which is less than the minimum 75 days required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=438)|
| 0:07:33| And assuming that the ordinance is passed on a timely basis, the matter then is placed on the ballot with a question frame so that the voters can answer it as either yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=453)|
| 0:07:46| If a majority of the voters who actually vote either yes or no vote yes, then the charter change gets adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=466)|
| 0:07:55| If it's not a majority of total voters in the general election itself, but a majority of the people who actually vote in that election, we know that in some elections, people just leave part of the ballot blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=475)|
| 0:08:09| And those votes would not count if they left this particular yes or no question or questions as it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=489)|
| 0:08:17| If they left them blank, those votes would not count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| It would just be a majority of the people who actually vote yes or no for the particular referendum that's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=500)|
| 0:08:30| So in the short time that I've had to review the ordinance, which has been presented here, it's apparent that the proposed changes to the charter in this single ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=510)|
| 0:08:42| they're numerous and they cover a fairly broad category of topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| So the question arises as to whether or not it's permissible to have a number of questions and covering a whole range of topics, not just a single topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=527)|
| 0:09:00| And the short answer to that question is yes, you can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| The attorney general of the state of Tennessee very specifically addressed that question in an attorney general's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| that's opinion number 06-124 that was issued on August the 2nd, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=551)|
| 0:09:20| And in that opinion, the attorney general concluded that only an amendment regarding the tax rate must be limited in substance to a single subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=560)|
| 0:09:31| The opinion goes on to state that the local legislative body could pass a single ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| including many changes or separate ordinances proposing separate amendments subject to separate votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=577)|
| 0:09:44| So you can do that either way you all elect that you want to do it if you're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| So thus this ordinance, which would cover quite a few changes to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| could in fact legally be brought as a single ordinance providing for a single vote by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| Now, I want to be clear. I'm not saying that this is the best or the most advisable method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| I'm just saying it does appear that it is a method that would be permitted under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| So that's kind of an overall look at the framework for how you go about passing a charter change in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=615)|
| 0:10:24| I'd be happy to address any questions or take any comments you have with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| When I see a council member sing with a hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| Thank you, Mr. Swanson. The first thing I want to do is take the urgency off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| This is something that I would like to accomplish right now, but I realize this is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| This is taking a while to research and figure out how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| But I want everyone to feel that they've had ample time to understand and vote with full knowledge of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=655)|
| 0:11:05| So I'd like to try to do it now, but if we can't, that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=665)|
| 0:11:15| Any questions for me? Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| Director Swanson, the question that would appear on the ballot for the voters who writes that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=681)|
| 0:11:30| Is that something that council would have to write or is your office right? Or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| It is a question that's contained within the ordinance. The question that goes on the ballot is contained within the ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=695)|
| 0:11:43| So typically the drafter of the ordinance, whoever that may be, drafts that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| Now, the the election commission has to review that question and conclude that it is a question that is an appropriate question for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=708)|
| 0:11:56| That you can properly answer yes or no and fits within the parameters that the election commission requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| But it doesn't have to be the law director's office to frame that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| It's going to have to be contained within the ordinance itself. So it wouldn't be a proper ordinance unless it contained the wording of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=727)|
| 0:12:16| So in an instance where you have multiple parts like we're presented with in the proposal today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| would it be likely that we would have a series of questions as opposed to one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=743)|
| 0:12:31| I understand your point earlier about having kind of very recently reviewed this, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| Could you share with us a little bit about what we'd be looking at with regard to that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| I think the answer to your question is it can be one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| You can see that if you go through the ordinance that it's been presented already, it does contain one question and it covers the entire ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| All the changes that are set forth in that ordinance. I think that under the attorney general's opinion, you can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| But if you wanted the voters to address each individual question rather than all of them lumped in together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=783)|
| 0:13:11| then you need to do a variety of different ordinances. It's going to be one question per ordinance and it can be a question that lumps them all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| Or you can do you could do like I saw about eight issues, I think, in going through this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| You could have actually eight different ordinances here with eight different questions that the voters would respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| That way they could they could itemize the things that they wanted to do or did not want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| I can't see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Councilwoman Singh and then if you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| I am imagining that we're going to need to go through this line by line similar to recode, but not as many hours, and then find the wording that works for everybody together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=836)|
| 0:14:12| I don't know if we have the time or if people have the bandwidth to do another workshop and work on that, or if we wait until it's on the agenda to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=852)|
| 0:14:30| So the question is, would we all be pitching in and figuring out the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=870)|
| 0:14:39| where everyone's comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Question is, could you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| You all are in charge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And we shall do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| You all decide how, how it gets drafted and what it says and all those kinds of things. So that's entirely within your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=892)|
| 0:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| I see Councilmember Fugate has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Thank you. This is more of a historical question. When's the last time the charter got changed and how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=906)|
| 0:15:15| You know, I was trying to think of that today. The last one, last charter change I remember is when the hybrid pension ordinance got adopted and that was like a year and a half, two years into the last administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=915)|
| 0:15:29| So that would have been, say, like seven years or so ago is the last time, last charter change that I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| If there was another one, it was fairly simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| Mr. Frost looks like he wants to answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| I referred to Mr. Johnson, who was kind enough to do some research about that if he has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| I'm on a different computer, so I don't have his research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| He might have it at his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| I can only speak to generally what I found in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| There were three charter amendments that were, I would describe as housekeeping related to the pension, supplemental plan provisions for the pension, and then Council put to the voters to advance the primary election for city in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=965)|
| 0:16:21| The Election Commission requested to push forward the election to give them more time for absentee and military ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=981)|
| 0:16:29| I don't have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| The last really significant change to the charter I think occurred when when they did the hybrid pension pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=995)|
| 0:16:51| I have a few questions, but they're regarding the individual items for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| So at the risk of stealing the thunder of our guests, I'll wait, but don't leave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| I've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Mr. Berta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Thank you, Director Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| One thing I thought of in the discussion we've had is whether or not there's any cost to the taxpayers for doing a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1028)|
| 0:17:18| I recall relatively recently, we had a discussion about paying Election Commission back for some of the services they had rendered in the previous election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1038)|
| 0:17:30| Do we have any way of estimating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Are there costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| If there are, is there a way of estimating what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| Yes, there are costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| There are the costs associated with with the city's share of any expenses associated with the Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| putting this on the ballot and all of those kinds of things that the Election Commission has to do with regard to publication and making sure it's on the ballot correctly and reviewing the ballot and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1064)|
| 0:17:56| And now they assess those costs to us after the election is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| I can't tell you how much that that has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| You probably remember the last assessment better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| Since I don't have to write the check, I don't I don't pay as much attention to the figures as maybe I should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| I was just going to say maybe we could have Mr. Johnson or we could have Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| Boyce look for us and look at what the charges were after that 2016 amendment and maybe refer back to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| The difference the variation in the cost for the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| When we recently had to approve increased costs, it had to do with volunteers and sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| So the Election Commission will tell us what the change in cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| And so if there was a difference in price, we should be able to get that from finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| Yeah, this will be more than that, though, because they'll have to publish a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| It's got that all that information on it will have to be a different ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| I'll ask Mr. Boyce to look up and see what it was after 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| So, counsel, if I may, for the sake of time, can we maybe just start collecting our thoughts around some follow up questions as relates to election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1158)|
| 0:19:27| what it would look like that we could send to Mr. Swanson, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| Frost and to wheel individually and then they could follow back up with us at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| I do want to give our guests an opportunity to be able to speak to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| But very good dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| And Councilwoman Singh, thank you for your for your statement earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| This is a lot of information. There are quite a few changes that are being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| And I would love to go ahead and hear firsthand from both from both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| I anticipate it may that we may require some additional conversation since we have limited time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| So if you all are in agreement, if there are no additional pressing questions, are we ready to start with our guest speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1204)|
| 0:20:13| Seeing no objection, we'll now have the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| Dr. Stephen Smith and Brady Watson will now go ahead and turn the call over to you to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| Great. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Can everyone hear me OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| Sound quality good. OK, great. So my name is Stephen Smith. I'm the executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| We've met most of you and I won't bore you with a long background on our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| We're here representing a coalition of groups called the Coalition to Act on KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| ACT standing for Increasing Accountability, Cost Savings and Transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1248)|
| 0:20:56| This coalition includes our organization, Appalachian Voices, One Knox Legacy Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1256)|
| 0:21:05| Community Voices, Statewide Organizing for Community Empowerment, SOCCM and the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| There are other groups that are in discussion with us and we think this will continue to grow and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| There's a lot of support for the basic concept of these measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Our attempt here is to try to reconnect, put the public back in the public utility that the city owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1281)|
| 0:21:31| We, as many of you know, were part of a coalition that worked a couple of years ago to work to try to get KUB to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1291)|
| 0:21:42| raising the regressive fixed fees on their customers around the electric sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| We had a freeze the fees campaign and we brought literally thousands of KUB customers in communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| with KUB executive team and their board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| And let me just say that our focus here is not on the rank and file KUB employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| They do a phenomenal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| We have a lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I interact with a number of them all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| This is really just targeted at the executive suite and at the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| We're trying to make very targeted changes there to help reconnect the public with this public entity that serves them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1335)|
| 0:22:23| And so what we did through that freeze the fees campaign was attempt to really work with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1343)|
| 0:22:31| going down to the board meetings, bringing folks down to actually interact with the board and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| And over time, to KUB's credit, they put a temporary moratorium on the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1356)|
| 0:22:45| But the process of going through that, we learned a lot about the level of engagement and interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| And I think only the electric fee was the one that they agreed to put a moratorium on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| Right now, if you look at your utility bills for gas, water, electric, and wastewater, you currently have to pay $85,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1380)|
| 0:23:11| closer to $87, actually a month before you get the first kilowatt of electricity, drop of water, therm and natural gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| And these are very, very high, and they're very regressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| And part of this has come from, we believe, a lack of direct interaction and communication with the citizens that KUB serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| In addition, there's been some other decisions that KUB has made in reference to extending a long-term contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1412)|
| 0:23:41| For now, 20 years, it is an evergreen contract that will actually extend every day for another 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| There are some concerns about that because other local power companies are actually threatening to leave the TVA system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| including TVA's largest customer, Memphis Light, Gas, and Water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| We then begin, through open records, begin to see how KUB was spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| And we noticed that they had some high-dollar engagement with a PR firm in town on a monthly retainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1442)|
| 0:24:11| And so what we wanted to do, and then we looked at how the board was actually adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| And so what we focus in on is actually getting more community voices on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| and making sure that KUB doesn't self-select the board by curating and limiting the list that the mayor gets to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| We're also proposing that the city council get to appoint two of the seven board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| which we believe will empower the city council to have both a representative of low income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| and also a representative with an environmental protection background and knowledge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| And so we're shortening the board terms right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| If you're put on the KUB board, you can serve for a seven-year term and then be re-upped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| so you could serve for as many as 14 years, which we believe is quite a long time for a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| And we believe that all of the people that apply to both the mayor and hopefully to the city council with this new reform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1504)|
| 0:25:14| the council will be able to see that full suite, the mayor will be able to see that full suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| It will not be preordained by KUB who the mayor gets to choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| because in essence what happens is the KUB is sort of helping self-select their board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| And we believe that limits their ability to be in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| There's a couple of other things in here that deal with getting the meetings up to the public in real time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| getting the meetings out of the top floor of the Miller building so that KUB is out communicating with the public more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| Those kind of things we have in our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| We're willing to have a constructive dialogue with KUB about the best way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| But there are some things that absolutely have to happen in the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| And I believe the board selection process, the terms of the board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| empowering the city council to actually be able to select a couple of KUB board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| And we believe having language in there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| We're not touching the rates. There's a difference between rates and fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| but there's virtually no language about fees in either the KUB bylaws or in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| And we believe there needs to be a clear process so that KUB cannot raise these fees without doing the proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1586)|
| 0:26:34| what's called the cost of service study or a comparable analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| And then having a public hearing where people can come and actually engage the board and decision makers at KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| about whether this is the best way to actually get the revenue that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| We are not interfering with KUB's revenue whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| They have complete ability to do everything they need to do within the variable rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| All we're trying to do is limit the regressive fee structure so that it sends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| it protects low income seniors, students, people in smaller houses and other things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| and sends the proper market signal. So I could go on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| but I know that we want to hear from both parties and we want to engage in dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| We are 100 percent committed to meeting as much as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| Obviously, everyone would have loved to start this process a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| We've had a pandemic. We've had a lot of very important justice issues that are being debated in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| And so we did the best job to bring a package that I think is very well thought through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| It has a lot of the elements that need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| We're willing to work with the council and KUB to get the appropriate mix on the ballot this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| But we feel very strongly and we believe the citizens want an opportunity to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| And then the final thing I'll say is we're not asking the council to make these reforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| We're asking the council just to put it on the ballot so that the citizens who happen to be KUB's customers can actually vote for these reforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1680)|
| 0:28:10| So what you're asked to do is just give the citizens the opportunity to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| And there'll be plenty of discussion about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| And that's what we're asking. And we're prepared to work as diligently as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| But we are keenly aware that there is a deadline approaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you very much. And I'm here to answer any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| Dr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Lynn, I don't know if you were first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| I just have one question about SACE's funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| And what is the intention and motivation behind SACE working on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| Are there any industries that are financing SACE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| And is there a political agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Well, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy is not part of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| We're not an affiliate or of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| We are a standalone 501C3 organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| We also have a 501C4 called the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy Action Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| None of those are affiliated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| We are not beholden or owned by any industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| We do work in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, as well as Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| We have a long history. I have about 25 staff that work for me across the Southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| We intervene in regulatory proceedings all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| We consider ourselves somewhat expert in electric utility policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| We testified before regulatory commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| We are grilled all the time when we go before these state regulatory commissions about our funding and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| Our funding is completely transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| We're funded primarily by philanthropic foundations, the Turner Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Energy Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1785)|
| 0:29:54| We have a couple of larger individual donors that are well-to-do but believe very passionately about things around clean energy, renewable energy, and climate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1794)|
| 0:30:05| And so, no, there's no political agenda. There's no industry agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| And we are not beholden to the Russians or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1809)|
| 0:30:21| Vice Mayor, my question related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| My question was about procedure and process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| I thought we were going to let KEB talk and then open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| In general, I'm afraid that in the interest of time, should we ask questions at the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1836)|
| 0:30:44| I'm just asking because my concern, I have several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| And my concern is we might not get to both KEB and the charter member proposers unless we save all our questions till the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1849)|
| 0:31:03| And I feel confident we won't get them all done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| And I certainly agree. Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| We will now go ahead and ask KEB to please present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| I will turn the call over to Mr. Gabe Bolas, CEO of KEB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| I'm Gabe Bolas, President and CEO of KEB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| I appreciate the chance to speak to all of you all and appreciate the time you're giving me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| I want to be brief because my board chair, Kathy Hamilton, is on this call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| I want her to be able to speak because there's a lot about the board issues, a lot of board topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| Obviously, this is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| I've talked to each of you individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| I've shared my perspective with each of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Bottom line, we serve 450,000 customers with four different utilities across Knox County and six other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1910)|
| 0:31:59| We're a big organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| We care about all of our customers, residential, industrial, commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| All that take into consideration when we do anything whatsoever with our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| You know, I feel passionate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| I don't think the charter change is the right way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| I think conversations need to be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| We're willing to listen, willing to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| We have shown that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| We have done things like freeze the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Be glad to answer any questions whatsoever you have of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| But I do want to let Kathy Hamilton have a few words to say before moving to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| So, Kathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| And again, let me say that I do appreciate you giving us time to speak here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| We were also a little bit surprised by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| We received it last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| And Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Smith has been at our meetings before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| He was there last September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Others from SACE have been at our meetings, but we had not heard of the issue of a potential charter change until this past Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1976)|
| 0:33:06| So, we're still processing it a bit ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| As I've read it, it appears that there are several issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| Some of them are around the area of accountability and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| And just so you know where I'm coming from on this, I'm someone who has spent a good amount of time in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2000)|
| 0:33:28| I spent 12 years as finance director for Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| I'm a CPA, have been licensed as a CPA for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| I spent the first 10 years in public accounting auditing a lot of city and county governments and school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2017)|
| 0:33:45| So, accountability and transparency are things that are very dear to my heart and that I have a great deal of understanding of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2025)|
| 0:33:54| And I just want to say that from what I've seen over my term at KUB, those issues are something that are embraced by KUB by not only the employees, but by the executive management and by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2034)|
| 0:34:10| We live day to day at KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| All of us, by our vision, that we exist to serve our customers and that we want to provide them with safe, reliable, and affordable utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2053)|
| 0:34:24| That's our reason for being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| I also want to address a concern that we really don't care or we don't pay attention to our low-income customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2067)|
| 0:34:39| And I would say nothing could be further from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| We really struggle to try and make sure that we are doing the right thing with our rates and with our fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| I appreciate Dr. Smith giving us the kudos for freezing the fees last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2090)|
| 0:34:59| We did do that after we took a look at it on the electric side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| But when you say that there's a difference in rates and fees, what you've got to take into consideration is that if it's not on your electric bill as a fee, then it's going to get added to the cost of energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2105)|
| 0:35:20| And one of the things that we hear from so many of our customers, our low-income customers that come in, it's about the difficulty that they have in paying their bills in the winter months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2120)|
| 0:35:31| And that's when they are using an excess of electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| And so those fees are part of what we use to make sure that the cost of the energy itself is not too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2135)|
| 0:35:45| We don't want to do anything that's going to cause our customers to not be able to afford to heat their homes in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2145)|
| 0:35:53| And that's part of the decisions that we have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| You also heard about our use of cost-of-service study that we should use and be bound by cost-of-service study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| Well, we had a cost-of-service study, and our last study recommended that we raise our residential rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| That's something else that the board took a look at and said, we do not want to do that because that's not the right thing for our residential customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2171)|
| 0:36:20| That will not help our low-income customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| And so we chose not to take that action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| We've done a number of things over the years in an attempt to try and help our low-income customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| You all are familiar, I know, with Project HELP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| It's been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| We've added the Round It Up program that is used to provide money for weatherization for our low-income customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2196)|
| 0:36:46| We have appropriated over $1.5 million in weatherization and water efficiency to try and help those customers be able to meet their demands and have a utility bill that is more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2206)|
| 0:37:02| We immediately took steps for our customers to stop any disconnects, to defer some rate increases that had been on the table as soon as this pandemic came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2222)|
| 0:37:15| And we acted very quickly and have done more than any other utilities I'm aware of in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2235)|
| 0:37:25| I'm also hearing that we aren't environmentally conscious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| We have recently taken steps to purchase 212 megawatts of solar energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2251)|
| 0:37:40| That will be equal to 8% of our electric load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| And we are the first of a TVA distributor to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| And we are enabled to do that because of the new contract that we signed with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| We're also working with the City on a community solar project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| I also want to say that our charter is very specific in making sure that KUB is an entity that is independent of the rest of city government and is independent from political and special interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2282)|
| 0:38:20| That was done in the beginning and it was seen as something that was particularly needed and necessary by the City Council at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2300)|
| 0:38:29| That charter has allowed us to make difficult decisions that serve the long-term interests of all of our customers in all those communities that Gabe referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2309)|
| 0:38:41| We are an extremely capital-intensive business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| And we are looking over assets that have 100 years of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| That doesn't mean they don't need to be maintained and upgraded in those 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| And we need to be very thoughtful about that and we need to have a long-term view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| The decisions that we make today with those assets are going to impact our customers decades into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2342)|
| 0:39:12| You don't have to look very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| You've seen examples across the country of utilities that have had catastrophic failures because they have not taken the actions necessary to have the dollars and the rights to maintain those infrastructure that they are responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2355)|
| 0:39:32| You haven't seen that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| And that's because of the decisions that have been made by this board and by boards in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| And those boards have a long-term view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| I think that view is partially enabled by the structure of our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| We have four utility systems that have multiple regulatory and business relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| All regulations are different from each system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| And it's a very complex organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| It's nearly a billion-dollar business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| And what I would say to you is that it takes more than a few years to really understand how everything works together in all those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2413)|
| 0:40:25| And it takes that time for each of us, I think, to be the most effective board member that we can be and to ask the right questions of the management at KUB to ensure that we are doing the right thing for our customers and for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2425)|
| 0:40:41| I also want to say about our nomination process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| Yes, we do have part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| We have the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| But what we try to do in that first step is we look to fill a board vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2452)|
| 0:40:59| We look at what we need talent-wise on the board to fill any knowledge gaps that we have among the other members to try to make sure that we have the right people asking the right questions at the right times to make sure that we are responsible and effective board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2459)|
| 0:41:22| I also want to say that after that first process, there's a process that you follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2482)|
| 0:41:33| We send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| There are rights that are reserved for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| If you don't feel that we have provided a balanced and qualified list of nominees, then you absolutely have the right to reject those nominees and to send them back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2498)|
| 0:41:50| So it is a two-part process, and it's a process that I think has worked well and has served the community well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2510)|
| 0:42:00| I also want to say that there are some details here that we're talking about that I really don't think belong in a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2520)|
| 0:42:09| I've never seen a charter that would specify meeting times and meeting locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| Once you have that in a charter, that really ties your hands to a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| And I can't imagine how we would be operating today and what we would have had to have done in light of this pandemic that we're facing right now if we were supposed to have meetings at a specified location and at a specified time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2541)|
| 0:42:40| I also want to say that I serve with some incredible fellow commissioners, and they have a real heart for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2560)|
| 0:42:51| They have a commitment to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| They have a commitment to the low-income people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| And again, we all look to try and do the right thing, to provide the best service that we can at the most affordable rates, and we have specific programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2577)|
| 0:43:09| I also don't think I mentioned we have social workers that work with people who call into us, who have help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| We are determined to do the right thing with the low-income people in our community and make sure that we give them safe, reliable, and affordable service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2596)|
| 0:43:26| So I think I would respectfully say that from our stand, we really don't think that a charter amendment is the right way to address some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2606)|
| 0:43:41| If you think that there are things that need to be discussed, we would hope that you would take the time to meet with us and to have the type of in-depth conversations that we need to talk about what we're doing, how we're doing it, and how we can best meet the needs of those in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2621)|
| 0:44:04| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2644)|
| 0:44:13| Thank you, Mr. Bowles and Ms. Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| KUB was created by the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I realized that it was an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| It serves much more a wider area, but it was created by Knoxville City Charter with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2665)|
| 0:44:33| It was also 80 years ago, and I don't believe we would have imagined some of the things that are going on now to happen at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2673)|
| 0:44:45| One of my biggest reasons around this is it is a municipal entity, and it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| As we see when people get disconnected and can't go back on, water is a basic need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| I think it's something that cannot be looked at in a business model, and that's one of the big reasons I'm trying to bring it back into the municipal umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2699)|
| 0:45:11| So council members, we only have five minutes left in this session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| I'd like to recommend that we schedule a follow up session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| There's just so much information that we need to absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| There's so much additional conversation I think that we need to have with both parties as well as amongst ourselves, because this is a really big decision that we are faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2725)|
| 0:45:38| I also want to say that you bring up some excellent points, Councilwoman, seeing that this charter hasn't been looked at as closely in 80 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| I also want to point out that I don't think that historically there has been a council that has stepped up to engage on the levels that we potentially are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2745)|
| 0:45:56| So I think that there's a lot of opportunity here for us as a council to be more engaged, to come to the table with not only the group that's brought us the Charter Proposed Charter Amendment language, but also with the KUB board and CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2756)|
| 0:46:11| This is not something that we have historically done, and I do think that there are definite changes that need to be made and to be considered, but I think that we're not going to solve that in four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2771)|
| 0:46:23| So if Council is in agreement, I would like for us to look at some dates. Mr. Johnson can look at some dates that we can maybe schedule an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2783)|
| 0:46:35| Maybe it won't take that long, but I'd like for us to at least give it that much time to have a follow-up conversation and further discussion so we can look at how do we want to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2795)|
| 0:46:46| go through each of these items that are proposed line by line and come to some general consensus or discussion, further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2806)|
| 0:46:57| I'm going to open it up now, Council, for your thoughts and recommendations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2817)|
| 0:47:08| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. I think that is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| Like I said, this is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| I first saw this yesterday at 1140 when it hit my inbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| It's the first time I saw all this actual documentation, so I'm trying to get up to speed pretty quickly, and I think going ahead and scheduling a workshop would be the most prudent thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2842)|
| 0:47:40| Council, we will poll for a workshop date and availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| I think it's imperative that all of us be available or try to be flexible to attend in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| If we have individual questions for either of the parties that presented us today, please feel free to go ahead and email them with your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| If you'd like to include all of your Council members, your peers, feel free to do so because we may need to have that information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| But I think that that's a good course of action for us to take moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| I want to thank the parties that took time to present to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| Again, we are on a tight time frame as relates to if this is even something that we would all be in agreement to even put on for a charter change on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2898)|
| 0:48:28| That sounds like that is a process, and there is a lot of information for we as a Council to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| I hope that you all will know that we appreciate the work that's been done, but it is in our best interest to do our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2915)|
| 0:48:43| So we will probably be inviting both parties back to the table for more dialogue, or if nothing else, please look for emails from Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2923)|
| 0:48:54| And I would ask that if you would, please try to respond back as promptly as possible with as much information as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| Councilwoman Singh, thank you for putting this together and proposing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| Do you have any closing comments for Council members before we have to adjourn the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| Thank you, guys, for making this fit into your schedule at such a last minute. I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| Any other questions or comments, closing comments from Council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| OK, having hearing none, we're going to go ahead and adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| It is now five fifty. We will have not quite ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| Council members, we need to get down into our city council meeting a few minutes before six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| But thank you all for your time. And I guess thank you for being here today. Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you. Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2985)|
| 0:49:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200630?start=2995)|
