| 0:02:53| we have two appeals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| More people have signed up if we're reading this correctly, then council rules allow so for 10 a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| So I'm going to suggest that the groups get together and decide who will actually represent you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| Otherwise, I'll just pick the first three on the list. So I'm gonna give you opportunity to decide among yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| We're just following council rules. You have up to three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| for up to five minutes each for either side and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| there's a rebuttal so you have the people that are for the appeal and those that are against it and then those who are for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=212)|

| 0:03:35| two minutes and rebuttal and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| if you look at 10 a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| Which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| the appeal by Sandra Woodland of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| MPCs decision to approve a use on review for child care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| If you are for the appeal, which means you are against the home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| I've got four people that are signed up to say they are against the home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| I'm saying that that way it's easier than saying if you're for against the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| It gets kind of confusing and those who signed up to say they were against the home occupation are Sharon Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| Sandra Woodland Carl Cook and Brenda Brooks if that is right if the four of you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=254)|

| 0:04:26| Okay, then you're on the other side there, okay, that was marked the wrong thing was marked so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Then we that's no problem. So we're fine on that appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| We've got three four and two David Hicks and Carl Cook signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| for the home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Okay, and so then on 10 B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| That's a rezoning appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| So if you are for the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| We've got three people signed up. We've got five people signed up who are against the rezoning. So I'll tell you those names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=294)|

| 0:06:02| a few things to report on first it seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| But every time we have a council meeting in the last few weeks or months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| I start out by thanking our Public Service Department and the emergency service crews for their work during a snowstorm and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| Last week we had a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Storm the biggest snowfall in 20 years and I know from what Chad weth and our public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| I know it was what Chad weth and our Public Service Department called a good storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| It started after rush hour on Wednesday, and it started melting quickly on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| But there was still a lot of snow out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| And I heard nothing really but positive feedback from our citizens a lot of what I heard is that folks were impressed with how well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| Our pre-treatment worked and how thorough it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| I know the brine trucks even got to a lot of the neighborhood streets what we call our level three streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| That are that's in our snow play and we can't often get to them because of the needs on level one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| But the main road stayed passable pretty much straight through the storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| So we were able to get to the level threes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| So again, and I hope this is the last time I have to say it this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| But we thank David brace Chad with all of the public service crews that were out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| We appreciate the our fire department and police department all of our emergency responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| Who made sure that the streets were safe and that you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| We could continue on during this storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| So and I also saw several of the public service employees this morning at the pancake breakfast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| they actually came in and had a little a good breakfast there at the Senior Center and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=451)|

| 0:17:57| I think the biggest question we have here tonight is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| the real question is is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| 25% too much or is 10% enough? I mean we've been trying to get this brought before you for seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1084)|
| 0:18:12| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| Mean it's been seven years. We hadn't been really trying seven years, but we've we've been working on it for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| but you know and another thing about this is it if we vote on if you vote on this tonight and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| Agree on this. We're already behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| substantially on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| what we're paid versus the people in other cities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Is it going to be another seven years before we can get it back on the agenda or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| But you know, it's all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Fairness I think and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| It's not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Like a cost of living increase. I know if it was a cost of living increase 25% would be a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| But this is not about labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| This is a matter of like equipment, you know our equipment you take a small wrecker back seven years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| It was probably about thirty five thousand dollars the average of it and today it can range anywhere from fifty to sixty thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| That's a substantial increase and just like a large wrecker. I mean you take several years back. They were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| the average cost of a large wreck was about three hundred fifty thousand dollars now today a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| Rotator and large wreckers are five hundred thousand dollars plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| You know and and it's just like our insurance it went from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| Forty five thousand dollars a year some fan in excess of seventy thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| And many other things tires from two hundred fifty dollars now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| There are nearly five hundred dollars and it's not just a matter of that. We're wanting to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| I mean our expenses. I don't think you really understand how much our expenses have grown and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| We we just want you to consider this whenever you're thinking about this 10% versus 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| I mean if we're that far behind right now 25% won't even bring us up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| to where we should be like other people are right now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| Four or five years from now. It's going to be we're even going to be further behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| But we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| We just like to have had you think a little bit more serious about it you got a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| Okay. Thank you, sir. Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1226)|

| 0:20:31| Vice mayor palace. Yeah, I think there's some confusion about the 10% I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| Originally y'all had asked for 10% and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| And I are 25% and I had, you know made a proposal that was not successful and then at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| I made a proposal for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| 10% over three years ever for three years three successive years exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| So it will be 30 foot. Well, hold on. It'd be 30% you asked for 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| You're going to get 30% which gets you closer to where you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| You've the the Commission or the committee has done the study and determined that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| Perhaps that you all are behind like cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| But you know, I don't want to belabor this a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| And I mean just you know, you know just for the audience and for the those at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| I mean since oh eight you all did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| bring forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| You know the the records in the in the information that was needed for the Commission to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| The committee to be able to to move and I know some of it was your may have been you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| It was proprietary. You all didn't want each other to know what what costs were some of the you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| Committee members were changed out and there's a lot of various reasons why it didn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| But six years is a long time and we also went to hold on now. Hold on. Hold on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| I've got I've got the floor here and six years is a long time and it kept, you know accumulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| So, but you know, I think that 25% may be warranted but not all at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| That is a huge increase for consumers to have to pay. So, you know, I thought about it obviously in between the two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1325)|
| 0:22:14| That it was first, you know voted down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1334)|

| 0:22:23| So again, I still think it's fair to the industry that you get 30% rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| 25% but it's going to be staggered to make it fair for the consumer as well because there's two sides to this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| Do we have to wait seven years? No, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| You can come back next year. You can come back next week if the if the committee says that it's time to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| But I agree with you, you know, we shouldn't wait and it should be incremental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| Smaller steps rather than 25% all at one time and those huge figures that you threw out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| According to what you've told me and what you said on record is that this is you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| A smaller portion of your all's business doesn't have that much effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1378)|

| 0:25:19| I thought amending it to actually increase it to 30% was too high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=1519)|

| 0:37:08| Actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Miss Wakefield has a really great idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| It's obvious. She has put forth a lot of time effort and money into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2233)|

| 0:37:21| successful one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2241)|

| 0:38:14| councilman, mr. Donaldson others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| To follow up a little bit on what miss Woodland has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| The daycare when I first heard about it. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Thought what is the big deal over a lady keeping three or four children in her home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| Especially if she wants to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| Her own children two of the children that she's keeping two of them her are hers and she wants to homeschool those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| So what's the big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| but as I began to look into it and listen to miss Wakefield and read about her vision and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| Her mission for the high hopes daycare center. I began to realize it is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| than just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Keeping a few children in her home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| If you had have you had a chance to look at her website councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| You see it's very professionally done the mission and vision that she states is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| Very nice. It sounds very good to me. It's just that she has set up shop in the wrong place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| Again the mission and the vision are very nice miss Wakefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| It's just that you're in the wrong location and speaking of location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| I'm a residential realtor for 32 years. And one of the first things that people ask me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| What do you know about the neighborhood what goes on next door? What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| What what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| To say that there's a daycare operation next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| Would not be good for property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| When I first met miss Wakefield over a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| She presented to the Neighborhood Association town hall East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| her vision and her mission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| At that time I understood her to say that she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| After a year she wanted to keep four children now and then after a year she would apply for state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| Licensing a year has come and gone. I don't know what she has done has applied or not applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| With the state, however, I do know that a month ago in front of the MPC commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| She stated that she had the approval and support of her Green Valley activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| from the Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| That is not true. I was at that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| There were 38 people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| one of them which was Greg Lutho from Knox County property assessors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| A lot of people there were out of those 38 I can easily say that half of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| Were not in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| Actually, the discussion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| halted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| There was no motion. There was no vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| So I feel like if the MPC commissioners a month ago had known that the Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| Was opposed to the activities on Green Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| We probably wouldn't be here today there we would probably wouldn't have had to file this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| So anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| That's that's the main thing that I wanted to bring to you and Brenda Brooks is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2484)|

| 0:43:41| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| problem with nine hundred square foot which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| 25% is that MPC also required miss Wakefield to have four parking places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| Well at least four hundred square foot of that home space that footprint of three thousand seven hundred and seventy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| At least four hundred square foot of that is used for the parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2640)|

| 0:44:12| Which means that 1,200 square feet if Miss Wakefield is using that much for her home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| Occupation she is using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2658)|

| 0:47:51| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| Would like to request that the original decision to allow for me to care for four children in my home remain is both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| Recommended by the staff and later voted on by the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| I was advised by the NPC a year ago that by watching only four children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| I was not in violation of any code it has always until now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| Been considered a permitted use is my understanding that child care is not regulated until there are at least six children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2894)|
| 0:48:22| According to Commissioner Cain this is from the minutes from the NPC hearing if this had come up to the city in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| They would not pursue it even if it came up as a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| They would say it is a permitted use yet somehow the interpretation has been made that I am operating a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| Occupation I would not have filed for a home occupation if I was not visited by Scott Elder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| Asking me to file a use on review for a home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Otherwise I was told that I could operate invisibly as do most of the daycares in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| That have less than four or fewer children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| I believe that the approval was granted simply to put me in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| With that sudden change of opinion about the city code which the wording in the code has not changed as mentioned in the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| This is the first time in 30 years that this has been brought before the body in regards to the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| I would like to make it known that after meeting with the Neighborhood Association a year ago to explain what I was doing and answer any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| Questions there was no motion made at that meeting in opposition to what I was doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| That is how I interpreted an approval and did not mean to misrepresent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| It was stated that I was in within my rights provided that I stayed within the city's limit of four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| Non-relative children and that was the end of the discussion. I have done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| Actually after the meeting I felt that miss Woodland still appeared to be unsatisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| So I want to speak with her directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| I asked her if she had any questions or concerns that I might address to make her feel more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| She told me there was nothing that I could do or say to change her opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| However at the NPC hearing miss Woodland claimed that she would arrange a meeting with the Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| Community Club to ask questions and discuss some pressing concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| Since the hearing I've been invited to soak no such meeting and I also haven't received any opposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| Communications since that time I was informed by a neighbor that about the petitions that there is misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| That was used to obtain those signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| My neighbor was told that I have seven children in care, which I do not I have three children in care and they are all right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| Say what those are my three the three children that are in care in addition to my two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| There was also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| He was also told that I would be changing zoning. There's no request to change zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| This would be a permitted use in an EN one zoning district. So there's not going to be any change to zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| I have not applied for licensing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| I have not said that I intend to because I'm not interested in applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| For licensing to to have any more children in care for is the maximum that I would want in care and right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| I only have three which is within those limits. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| Think that it's being misrepresented that I'm running a commercial operation when it's simply not the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| I care for three children two of which are residents of Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| I'm actually serving the children that live in my community and another parent is a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| Elementary school teacher and she is the one that has the infant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| Providing care for the children in my community as a service. It's not a commercial encroachment of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| I operate invisibly with no signage no changes to the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| No zoning amendments that would impact property value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| And I don't want anyone to lose sight of the fact that I do live in a single-family home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| That is my primary residence above anything else. I live there with my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| Yeah, 45 seconds my parents chose me in part because I'm not a commercial facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| But because they want an individual attention that can't be given in a commercial facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| And my droplets are staggered which eliminates any potential traffic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| And my neighbors are not affected by my watching the children in my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| I would hope that the council preserves the original decision for approval or otherwise enforce the code equally by amending was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| Potentially a citywide residential zoning issue if this new interpretation is allowed. Thank you. Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3138)|

| 0:54:50| Oh, well, the definition contained in the zoning code is not a daycare. Do you have six or more kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3290)|
| 0:54:57| They came down on the fact that hey, this is a home occupation. She's getting paid. She's earning a living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| She's earning money doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Well, if you're going to do all that there are thousands of people in Knoxville that are deducting their home on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3306)|
| 0:55:14| Their income taxes that makes them in non-compliance, too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| And I think some of the people you need to remember about this you'll have magistrates out all night long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| With law enforcement come to their house to sign a sign warrants during the night. That's just some of them and then on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3323)|
| 0:55:32| Commissioner Kane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| So we're going to be seeing a lot of this in the future if the people follow the city's unpublished interpretation I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3333)|
| 0:55:42| Realize the council members are learning the facts of this as we speak for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| But this is this violates the spirit of open government and due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| If you want to change a policy that's going to affect this many people in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| Have a public debate put public notice out there and actually publish it in the coats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| And then let let the people comply with that and then I want to make a comment about the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3362)|
| 0:56:10| If you look in the packet that she gave you in the school there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| If you look at the milestones of learning what she's teaching these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| She's teaching them how to walk without falling. She's teaching them a transfer objects from one hand to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| she's teaching them toilet training if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| you're not allowed to teach this in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| Daycare center at the public school is going to be ready to teach this. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| mean, these are basic skills that go back for years in human life and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| Have one minute sir. Well, I believe I'm done on that right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| I'm just saying we need a public debate on this before you make a decision. You actually need to publish this in the city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3406)|
| 0:56:54| You know instead of the city coming down and doing an interpretation on a policy that has stood for more than 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3414)|
| 0:57:03| Thank you. Thank you, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| And now mr. David Hicks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| Please state your name and address for the record and thank you for being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| Thank you very much for having me David Hicks one two two Royal Heights Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| three seven nine two zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| Come before you tonight in appreciation for letting me speak I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| Can start by saying that miss Wakefield took care of my daughter my very first daughter at the age of 43| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| For the last seven months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| My wife and I are both highly educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Every one of these parents that take their children to miss Wakefield are also highly educated people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| We chose to to take to go to this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| With the intent that we were happy with the outcome and every day that I would pick up my daughter and I'll take her home and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| Show my wife just how much improvement was going on a daily basis. I was overwhelmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| I have other friends that take their children to other daycares a lot bigger daycares with a lot of children and they are not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Did not spend a lot of time reading all the codes and figuring out you know exactly what a home occupation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| But I do agree with mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Cook that you know this is not and I can say this from personal experience. This is not a daycare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| It is a lady trying to provide a nurturing environment for four children that are not her own children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| and I trusted her with that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| I have never seen any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| Change to the exterior of her home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| I drove up and down that street for seven months every single day five days a week and the only time I ever saw any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3521)|
| 0:58:48| Disruption is when he ripped up the whole street to put in pot water pipes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| And that was the only destruction I ever saw and I rarely even see the parents picking up and dropping off the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| And there's only four children there, so how can that be a disruption the children do play in the backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| But what a beautiful noise to hear children playing in the backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| So that's all I have to say obviously I'm in support and miss Wakefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| I think that you know if this needs to go to the public and kind of work through the work through the threads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| That's fine, but you know we don't have to burn this burn this building down just because of a simple issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| So that's all I have to say thank you so much for letting me speak. Thank you, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| Okay, now miss Woodland. You have up to two minutes or somebody on your side up to two minutes for a rebuttal if you choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| Mayor O'Hara council at just a few points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| Mr.. Cook, I think he used the word teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| repeatedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| We the last gentleman we are not debating that this is a good school or that she is doing a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| That's not what the appeal is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| The appeal is that the regulations that govern home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| Occupations are being violated those regulations are to be strictly construed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| Clearly they're being violated miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| Wakefield was approved for four children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| We have proof here tonight by their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| Statements that she has four children plus her two children. That's six. That's more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| NPCs own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Allowance said that she could have she was supposed to have two plus her two children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| We're not debating how good a quality her business is it looks like it's a great business model what we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| Concerned about is the fact that we have a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| variance in our neighborhood in the very smack dab middle of Holston Hills and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| That this is a commercial business that should be on the parameter under the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| Under all the things that we have worked so hard to protect us through en1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| And that is our request that the appeal be approved. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| Councilman Del Vecchio yeah, thank you mayor. I appreciate all the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| They all I think were very articulate and made their points very well something was left out as in looking through the appeal I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3669)|
| 1:01:17| Among other things and thinking about this because I've had a lot of phone calls and people have contacted me about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| It was not mentioned, but the general plan and and the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| Actually argue against what MPC did here and in and that is that the general plan states in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3689)|
| 1:01:37| 9.12 and elsewhere 9.9 that if you're going to have activities that are business like in that case they talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| daycare centers or other neighborhood services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| They belong one on the edge of the neighborhood not in the middle of the residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| And you have a map in front of you the one in the in the packet was fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| But if you look at this first map, you'll see that this en area is a total single-family residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| That's that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| One point the second is and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| 9.12 of the general plan says not only is it on the perimeter of residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| But it's on arterial or collector streets, and we've got a local road here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| We've got Green Valley that just serves Green Valley if you want to get to a collector street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| You have to go out at least to show how we drive that goes up to Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| Which is an arterial and the point that's being made is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| You know neighborhood services are great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| But they belong on the outer edge of the community and you have a map in front of you that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| In in color this idea that Asheville Highway and part of Holston Drive up close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3763)|
| 1:02:51| Nashville Highway is the area that serves this community Holston Hills and Chilhowee Hills and actually several other neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3771)|
| 1:02:58| But it's replete with things that that are community service and business activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| You have a sheet of paper that gives you a few bullet points, but I mean there's there's two dozen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| Kinds of things up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| You know between doctors offices and and clinics and churches and schools and the community library in the community park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| And that's where this design community was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| Looking at in in its day, and it's a historic or at least an established neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| Is that the peripheral area is the service area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| It's not in the center and and the neighbors are pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| There's probably 40 or 50 of them out there that that that want you to know that they don't want to see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| Slowly change into something else. I mean miss Wakefield's got a nice idea of taking care of kids and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3821)|
| 1:03:48| Obviously she'd like to do it in their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Maybe it's less expensive to do it there, but but that's the first step once we start doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| we're going down this path of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Finding inexpensive homes in our community that get converted to businesses, and that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| Desirable according to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| It's not why we have Ian zoning and it's not what the general plan says and if you look at the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| It's in your packet as well. There's a reference to the fact that there's been increased pressure in residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| To be rezoned commercial that was one of the concerns and and we're trying to avoid that in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| Some of you weren't here. I guess maybe mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| Frost was here probably eight or nine years ago that we had a chiropractor who wanted to convert part of her home into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| Business area and you know we like the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| They're part of the neighborhood, but we don't want to start doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| We don't want to bring cars in there that we're not familiar with we don't want to have problems that we don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| Someone mentioned that road Green Valley Drive doesn't have a sidewalk. It's got ditches on the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| I mean, it's a place that that if you add more traffic you add more concern, and it's a very local road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| So let me just sum it up by saying that that it's a nice idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| But it's in the wrong place, and we welcome miss Wakefield to to open up a daycare center a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| In an area where it's appropriate and also add some of you have been on council when Sequoia had an issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| With someone teaching more than one student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| They were teaching klezmer music in a house along there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| And and this council said you know what one T one teacher per student at a time is okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| That's what the the home office activity allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| But but not but not running a separate thing as to the point about what's published or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| And and vetted publicly I would say this the general plan has clearly been vetted publicly and adopted by this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| So has the sector plan and so has the ordinance that says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| What a what a home business is or home occupation is and what the restrictions are so I'm not sure why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| MPC didn't look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| I think they were looking at the particular example and forgetting the backdrop therein| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| Which is we work our zones up and through the you know to the planning process. I think that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| I don't think we should just brush that aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| Think those are the main points that we should focus on and I asked your consideration of this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| Not because she's doing something that isn't desirable in some sense, but it's in the wrong place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| Thank you, sir mayor Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Yes, thank you, Mary. I was over there today to look at that particular property on Green Valley and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3984)|
| 1:06:32| I have a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| The Holston Hills Community Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Have you met I'm gonna ask that of the first lady who addressed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| Mrs. Woodland or yeah, mr. Woodland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| Somewhere in our packet, I think you stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| There is a community club within the area. Have you met and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| Miss Wakefield said she has not heard from him. I want to know if you have met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| Okay, that was discussed during the MPC hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| before the vote was taken and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| I can't remember exactly who it was. Mrs. Cole. I believe her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| so she was asking about if we could all meet together and I said yes or something similar and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| With miss Wakefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| Then the vote was taken and actually I was there first for a asking for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| Because I had only received one day notice there had been no sign in miss Wakefield yard at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| I travel that road a minimum of two times a day because that's how I get to how we drive. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| Personally never saw an MPC sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Every person I have asked who are my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| Just my friends around not one person not people across the street not on each side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| no one ever saw the sign and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| it was Tuesday before the MPC hearing on Thursday and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| MPC sends out a little postcard to people who live within 250 feet of the 5711 residents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4093)|
| 1:08:22| There I think that's maybe only three or four people who receive the card and one of those neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| Called me and asked me what was going on and I said, well, I didn't know so I called downtown and found out that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| Was a hearing the next day. I had a one-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| Notice so I went to the MPC hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| Just to ask for a postponement of 30 days because we had not gotten together. There had been no talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4120)|
| 1:08:48| We were surprised by this action actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| That's the way it was at the MPC hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| I went there for the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| My postponement was denied and they went straight into no real discussion about too much about her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| Preschool and then they voted on approving her. And so after the fact that she was already approved I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4145)|
| 1:09:15| Didn't know what the reason of meeting with her would be about when I was agreeing to a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| I thought so that maybe we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| Within the 30-day postponement find out a little bit more what's going on before this approval was granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| But the approval was granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| Okay, other question. I have the owner stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| Previously he had someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| Renting a home who also had I was keeping kids. I don't know if it was a daycare or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| But did anyone complain about that at that time? Is he talking about the same residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| Is it the 5711? I think he's did he own more than one property? I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| I'm not aware. Come back. I'm not aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| Does he own more than one property on the street? I honestly didn't think he was the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| Was the owner I've talked with Karl Cooke senior last year and he told me he was the owner not junior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| So I don't let me ask him to come down if that's all right, man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| You you're the owner of the yes property that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| I paid the taxes on it and they mail the taxes to my address if somebody wishes to go upstairs and check did you do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| Own some other property there. Yes. No, not in Holston Hills. No, so I'm saying the property that we're talking about now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4231)|
| 1:10:39| You had someone there that kept children. Is that correct? That's correct. Yes. Did you get any complaints at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| No, I did not no one from the community said anything. No, I did not how many children were kept there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| Do you know I really don't know. I know that she had like three kids of her own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| Her father had moved in because he'd been in a home care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| Facility and he moved in with them and then she had some additional kids for okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| well, I don't want to be labor of the point, but I wrote over there I looked at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| Neighborhood and really I don't see a big problem with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| Myself, I know that people are up in arms. Let me let me ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| Mark, could I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| If this lady moves out this man owns the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| And if someone else can they come in and open some other type of quote-unquote home business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| Would they have to come back before MPC to do that or tell us about that if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| Among the conditions that were placed on this particular approval was the condition that the use is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4309)|
| 1:11:57| Specific to miss Wakefield so that in the event miss Wakefield moves from the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| That particular home occupation no longer exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| All right. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Those are all of my questions. I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Want to be clear on how many children are there miss Wakefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| Said she has how many children are actually there including her own two if you don't mind coming back miss Wakefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4335)|
| 1:12:28| You have how many including your own including my children there are five total there are five children and yours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| Can keep four or non-relative children or non-relatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| That means you won over I guess but thank you. Anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| Those are my questions one under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| One under the limit, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| Or non-relative children, so your children do not count in that number. Oh, I see. Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| Thank You councilman Delvaux, yeah, thanks one point I want to clarify I want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| Attorney Frost about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| But Mark mentioned that MPC put in a condition that it's personal to her and if she moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| Then it sort of goes away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| That to me sounds like a personal permit and not a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| Which is a zoning land decision that stays with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| I'm going to ask our council if you could advise us about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Two weeks ago or whenever we had the last meeting I asked Mark that question and he answered not about this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| but but that a use that a use on review is something that pertains to the land and not to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| Individual who happens to be occupying it at the moment. Yes. Thank you councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| Before this meeting I researched the issue that one condition that MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| Put on their list of various conditions and I have a concern that the granting of a use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4435)|
| 1:14:03| with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| with the idea that as soon as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| Ms. Wakefield leaves the premises it goes away. I personally I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| Legal concerns that that would be the case you heard one of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| In favor of the appeal talk about the issue of something running with the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| That's a that's a legal concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| Let me give you a for instance when this council rezones a piece of property for sake of argument from c3 to c4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| That c4 designation stays with the property no matter who owns it no matter who's the tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| No matter when the tenant leaves and no matter when the ownership changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| So in that regard I respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Disagree with mr. Donaldson that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| You can condition this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| occupant leaves the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| Premises it might very well be something that runs with the land where the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| person could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| Continue that that use and then you also have an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| Concerning the enforcement of that, but that obviously is more from the administration side of this equation versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| Council, but I would respectfully disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| With that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| I'd like to finish by saying I'd like to move that the appeal be granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| Which I understand in layman's terms means that we would undo or reverse what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| MPC did and deny the use on review, so I'm gonna make the motion that we grant the appeal second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| Okay councilman Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Thank you mayor. I'm a little troubled by this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| If nothing had happened from the outset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| This use would be permitted as I understand it am I correct mr.. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| Not not not with conditions. Just the use if in other words if this had never come to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| That use is permitted in this zone is it not well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| I'm not familiar with the background that led to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| Enforcement of this particular issue that would be probably better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| Placed question with the administration how it got to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| I'd like to address that briefly because because I heard that your confusion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| What happened was that the city has and our ordinances say that the building code official is the one that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4593)|
| 1:16:42| Interprets the zoning codes and in that case mr.. Scott elder was the was the building code official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4602)|
| 1:16:49| He made a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Based on at least three things the fact that the website talked about all this commercial activity that it was a broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| Business type approach that that that it was done for money that there were complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| He was already receiving not sure from whom about this business going on or about to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| He made the determination that that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Something that would have to come under the home occupation standard in section 12 now as I understand the law and someone can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| Correct me if you disagree with his decision you can appeal to the BZA and challenge it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| Just like you can any other kind of permit or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| Interpretation that wasn't done so the applicant went to MPC and MPC has to abide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| I believe by the determination by the code official unless they're going to take it to council and recommend something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| And maybe they will in the future, but but the standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| Determination in this particular file was that that this was something that was a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| Occupation and therefore must go through the use on review process and now we find ourself here MPC allowed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| But I'll submit to you that if you look at the general plan if you look at the sector plan if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| Ordinance, and you apply the facts to this that that their decision is wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| It should be reversed and it also goes against the grain of harming this neighborhood or potentially doing so I'm personally concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| What happens when the next business applicant comes because it's harder to say no the second time you start looking arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4697)|
| 1:18:24| So I don't think we can pick and choose. I think this is the law of the community, and I think it ought to be enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| Restricting this to a peripheral area well you've addressed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| To some degree I guess from a legal standpoint, but I'm concerned the lines appear to me to be kind of blurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4714)|
| 1:18:42| If somebody in any neighborhood and an r1 or an en1 or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| Can operate can keep children after school or whatever up to four or six or whatever the definition is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| It seems to me. They that's a use permitted in that zone period now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| If the health department has to get involved those are some other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| But I guess where I'm going with this that there's some things about this that bother me especially the website because that suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4747)|
| 1:19:15| Something beyond what appears to be present right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| And and may appear to be going toward a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| Genuine business which I agree should be out of that zone should not be in that zone so I am concerned about the balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4764)|
| 1:19:32| But if if the appeal if we if the appeal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| confirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Then can someone else can this person still operate with four children in their house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4779)|
| 1:19:47| The appeal if you read the MPC thing or or think about it if the appeal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| Granted that is that the that the activity is not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| Then presumably the code official could go out there and say cease and desist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| It would be like any other use. It's improper would be like the Klezmer music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| I'm having concerts and teaching five kids at once, but I thought that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| the use of up to four children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| was allowed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| in these zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| Councilman Saunders it might be good if we heard from our zoning facilitator Scott elder. He's here with us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| He can help guide us through the interpretation that was made and the facts of this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| Councilman de la Volpe described some of those and Scott can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4830)|

| 1:21:41| To have her child care business there, but as a gainful occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| What she's conducted there is is considered home occupation. I think ultimately MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| Agreed with that and that is the reason they had there. They accepted that as a use on review and went through that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4911)|

| 1:22:18| According to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=4938)|

| 1:28:14| In front of you with regard to the plan amendment to act on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| But you can initiate your own plan amendment request and and I'm I'm thinking that this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5299)|
| 1:28:27| Is doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5307)|

| 1:29:19| I thought because the neighbors were going to meet with the developer and there was a big debate about density and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| Whether there should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5366)|

| 1:34:55| so we end up with a true town center rather than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5695)|

| 1:35:27| I live in North Shore Town Center at 95 23 Clingman stone Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| First let me preface that throughout the recent meetings with Flournoye North Shore market investors MPC and residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| We are still strongly in support of the town center concept, even though I'm speaking this evening on behalf of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| And a majority of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| I should say I am simply a willing representative of them and due to my profession as an architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| I try to work with the professionals in our community to be engaged and aware of what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| Please know that I and others who have met with Flournoye have made every effort to keep our neighbors in the loop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| With repeated emails and requests for input questions concerns, and I have received no negative comments toward Flournoye's development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5767)|
| 1:36:15| Know too that I bought my home in North Shore Town Center because I believe strongly and carefully planned town center design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| Communities and have worked on them professionally in Knoxville and throughout other cities as you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| Flournoye originally proposed garden style apartments for the remaining 10 acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| Tract of property at the bottom of North Shore Town Center on behalf of the neighborhood several of us became involved and imposed the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| Because it required the removal of TC1 zoning and because the apartments made no effort to comply with the design guidelines of North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5796)|
| 1:36:45| Unfortunately the removal of the TC1 zoning was required because of the developers need to increase density for the economic viability of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| At that time the most important concern for us was that they were proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| Standard suburban garden style apartments with little or no regard for the design guidelines that are part of TC1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5817)|
| 1:37:04| I know many of you voiced our shared concern that it seemed that if TC1 zoning regulations were removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| The remaining portions of the property that the overall town center concept would be lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| And it would be a detriment to the residents who built homes knowing they were protected by the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| We thank you for suggesting that Flournoye meet with us and engage in a dialogue of their proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| Development and how it could add rather than detract from our growing planned community since that time I appreciate Flournoye's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5845)|

| 1:37:43| But they have invited critique been responsive to our comments and readily exchanged updated drawings and designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| From the initial meeting they made it clear that they needed to have a certain distance a density to make the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| Economically feasible yet despite the density and zoning we continue to meet and discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| Flournoye has completely redesigned the apartments with a more urban feel and a design compliant with the design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| They have provided additional drawings indicating landscaping parking retaining walls and buffers though legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| They still have to have the zoning change for density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| We are very pleased that they have agreed to the following points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5894)|

| 1:39:23| We have developed with Flournoye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| the continued redesign efforts that they have put forward and their willingness to continue to work with us in good faith toward a shared interest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5964)|
| 1:39:32| The overall success of North Shore Town Center. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Butler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| And now mr. Column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| Thank you for being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5979)|

| 1:39:47| Hello, bud column 63 12 Kingston Pike Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| 37919| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| Mayor and the councilman has most of you already know we've been involved in this overall project for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=5994)|
| 1:40:03| Very quickly, I would like to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| Because of the way the original ownership was structured and when the notes were purchased and the properties were foreclosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| Our group ended up with the majority but not this property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| Even though this property in question is thought of as a part of and for that matter is a part of the North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6018)|
| 1:40:26| complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| so from that standpoint we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| Do not have a direct dog in the hunt if you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| However, we deem that it is very important to the overall development and I want to point out some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| very quickly the fact you may hear tonight about the density and you may hear about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6040)|
| 1:40:49| traffic and in road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Point out that we had a nine million dollar TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| And we have spent close to 12 million dollars on road improvements those road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6055)|
| 1:41:02| Obviously that amount of money very extensive and those road improvements were based upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6062)|
| 1:41:10| Having the infrastructure in place to handle the original development as was proposed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| 2000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| The density if it weren't for the fact that the properties are separately owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| The density would probably not even be an issue and potentially not even need for the property to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6087)|
| 1:41:35| the overall density from the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| Or the project when you factor in not only the commercial but the residential from what was approved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| 2004 I think Arthur mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| But I want to stress it again, even if this is approved the overall density is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| substantially less the road improvements have been put in to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| accommodate the density that was that was proposed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| contemplated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| 2004 so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| Not only is the density down, but the road improvements are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| To finish up we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Think that this especially with the changes that Flournoye was willing to make to accommodate the neighbors in our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6132)|
| 1:42:20| We think that it is exactly the intent of the town center the new urbanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6140)|
| 1:42:27| idea and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| we have some very exciting things on the drawing board from the commercial side around the lake and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| Next to the target that will carry on the new urbanism the town center concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| One of the things that's been holding us back is getting more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| residential density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| Anyone else has any questions, I'll be happy to answer, but we're very much in favor of it. Thank you, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| Okay, now so we now move to those who are against the rezoning against the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| I have Frank Slegel Gary Bennett and Rob Suggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| If you would just come forward and state your name and address for the record and thank you for being here. I'm Gary Bennett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6182)|
| 1:43:09| 1917 White Aram Lane Knoxville three seven nine two two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| In the next adjacent neighborhood just west of this property my property doesn't adjoin this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| I am within 300 feet of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| And I just I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| I've been to several meetings, and I actually missed the last meeting so that's how I got appointed to be here speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6206)|
| 1:43:33| That's what happens, but a couple points that popped up this thing has changed a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| We were at 246 now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| It's at 248 so a little bit of a curveball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| But just to address a couple of the comments that were made you know when this thing was started in 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| We're never going to get back to that density when we put in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| The target and the public's and change some of that and I understand those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| They were they were done to you know get the thing spearhead to get it spark going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| We lost the opportunity to have the original density so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| What we're looking at here, and I'm off my script, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| This thing is one piece of property. It's 10 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| And from what I understand the new proposal doesn't include any of it the property east of Thunderhead Drive to be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6250)|
| 1:44:18| It is zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| There are places over there where you could have this type of high-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| So anyway this this 10 acres has been targeted as an area to put in what was originally 246 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6265)|
| 1:44:34| What was there originally planned was 160 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| There is road. There's a road loop road in there. There are utilities and infrastructure in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6278)|
| 1:44:45| 460 units now I know with flournoy coming in they will have to get that all up to code, so I'm not arguing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| But it's it's not designed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| 248 units now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| It is a shoehorn type situation where we're going to squeeze all this these apartments and these units into this 10 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6297)|
| 1:45:05| And it benefits the developer it benefits all the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| It doesn't benefit the neighbors that that properties adjoin it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| The other part of it is they will have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| That site was loaded with rock you know we heard him pounding on a rock for four years it seemed like but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| We were excited about the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| They're actually going to fill up to 10 feet of fill in the rear of the property to avoid the rock and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6326)|
| 1:45:33| This is a this is a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| Keep the cost down to keep the cost as low as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| We discussed this at Dwayne's office, and it was said you know well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| And that but there are obviously ways to put ramps in and keep this property at a lower elevation if needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| But the problem there is you hit rock, and that's not what developers want to do is put dollars into the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| They want to get the thing built as least expensive cost and move on so those are a couple points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6354)|
| 1:46:01| That you know again utilize they're trying to utilize the existing infrastructure. They're trying to save costs cut costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6361)|
| 1:46:09| The other thing that really you know we keep talking about the town center concept we were all I was all for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| when you squeeze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| Over 200 and the parking that they had was a 1.73| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6378)|
| 1:46:25| Spaces per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| I think that's so it's less than two cars per unit. I think that you know typically apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| I would I would assume probably there's two cars per unit there to most of them are two-bedroom one-bedroom three-room apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| But the point is there's going to be probably 50 to 70 cars looking for a space to park every night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| But also there is all this parking. There's all these buildings. We're squeezing it onto 10 10 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| So we've eliminated the town center concept in that area very little open green space very little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6412)|
| 1:46:59| Public area there's no walking trail. There's not room for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| Next to our neighborhood. There's a 10-foot buffer and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| There's 10 foot of fill in some areas a little retaining wall, and it slopes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| They're going to plant that you know a few trees in there, but there's no room for the tax 50 seconds, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| So anyway, I would just I know this is changed a little bit here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| But I'm asking that you keep the previous commitments of the MPC and deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| Flournoy's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6447)|

| 1:47:30| Sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| Please state your name and address for the record. Thank you for being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| My name is Frank Slagle in my address is 1924 white Aram Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| My wife and I own one of the houses that is adjacent to North Shore Town Center property that Flournoy's asking to be rezoned to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6466)|
| 1:47:52| allow high-density residential apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Although our house is not in the city of Knoxville because the city limit line is the back of our property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6475)|
| 1:48:01| We do and own a business in the city of Knoxville and we in the building it occupies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| We are city taxpayers, and we are property qualified to vote in city election in addition as I understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6485)|
| 1:48:12| We have legal standing if the need arises to appeal to a higher court because of the proximity our property to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6492)|
| 1:48:20| property being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| This is really a unique situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| None of the residents in North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| Which live in the city have legal standing in this case because they live so far away from the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6507)|
| 1:48:33| There are 33 house homes in the city at North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| And even within that neighborhood for residents have signed petition opposing the sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| The one-year plan change and the rezoning we have more than 1,200 homeowner signatures on a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6523)|
| 1:48:49| Opposed to this sector plan change zoning change in 24 units per acre density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| The people who live in Admiral's Landing, Lake Ridge, and North Shore Landing have legal standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| Because they are so close to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| But they are on the very edge of the city limits because of the finger annexation that was forced on us years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| We are not against development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| We are not against apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| But we are against high-density apartments that would put a parking lot literally 10 feet from our property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6552)|
| 1:49:18| Think about it. That's the width of a parking space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Between their parking lot and our property line and more than 200 vehicle trips in and out every day according to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6561)|
| 1:49:29| The Southwest County sector is very densely populated and continues to be fast-growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=6569)|

| 2:00:42| when they talk about a number of the emails that I've gotten over the last couple days has had to do with this legal standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| And maybe you can explain a little bit about what this means. Thank you. Councilman grave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7248)|
| 2:00:53| Standing in this particular circumstance. I heard mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| Slagle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| Discussed that that that's a legal concept whether or not a party has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| The ability to bring a suit if they have some claim or some injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| I respectfully submit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| Tonight that is not an issue for City Council to consider that is a judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7272)|
| 2:01:18| determination whether or not someone does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| Or does not have standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| Think I think the other thing that I want to point out to council is that I don't think that we are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| Finished with the final plans in the final what this is finally going to look like and this is one of the reasons of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| Course it has to go back to MPC for the for the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| But I also know and the commitment has been made by the developer that they will continue to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| Not only the city residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| But also the county residents in terms of what they can do in order to continue to improve them improve the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| so I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| respectfully request that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| Council honor the motion that I put forth and that has been seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| Thank you, I don't know if mr. Column or one of the other gentlemen that spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| For or against can answer this but I keep scratching my head and wondering we started out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7331)|
| 2:02:16| Excuse me. We started out with 24 acres that we're going to take up this housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| Density idea and then for some reason I don't quite understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| We either gave away 14 acres to a school system or sold it and kind of reversed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7347)|
| 2:02:34| The action we're going at so now we're we're struggling to shoe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| I guess more units than this site maybe should have and can anyone tell me how did we get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7358)|
| 2:02:45| I mean, maybe that's maybe that's spilt milk, but I just I don't understand exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| That aspect but but the school now adds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| children and their safety and less space to foot the density so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| And maybe that's for MPC. But could you could you tell me something? I've been here since day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| So I hope I can tell you well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| Mr. Cotman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| Well, I asked for him they can both speak but I just want to just want to hear briefly to try to be brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| Just get to the point. What how do we get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| There was originally planned multifamily housing where the school is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| The difference is in the original plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7402)|
| 2:03:25| There was a line of single-family homes that was a buffer between the multifamily homes and the residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7405)|
| 2:03:32| So they were going to step down towards the so now they're moving they're sliding down toward North Shore in the liquor store and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7412)|
| 2:03:41| Where it normally takes 20 acres to build a 250 acre complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| They're trying to cram it down into ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| It'll be nine buildings a swimming pool a pavilion a clubhouse and a play yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7427)|
| 2:03:54| That's the equivalent size of four parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| There is no green space because there is no space the buffer that everybody keeps talking about between our neighborhood is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7438)|
| 2:04:05| 10 feet wide that's the width of a parking space and in the middle of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| They're going to put a fence and on one side of the fence are going to put trees that are going to mature to 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| Feet unfortunately the trees they plan on planning or giant green Arbor Vita that do grow to 25 feet and die| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7454)|
| 2:04:21| But they are 12 to 20 feet wide at that point and they've only got five feet between their parking lot and their fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7461)|
| 2:04:27| It's just not enough space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| But the reason they've moved it down here and there's there's at least three other sites in North Shore town center that would hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7469)|
| 2:04:37| Enough acreage to support a development this size and the general plan which requires that you keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7477)|
| 2:04:45| Out of scale developments next to each other they need to be moved internally to keep it away from this my issue was the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7485)|
| 2:04:52| Maybe that mr. Cullen can enlighten me. What happens? Why do we give up half the land that we needed for density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7492)|
| 2:04:59| Well as you recall the school system wanted the property and we met with the neighbors in our development and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7499)|
| 2:05:07| The consensus was that that would be a good fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| We're trying to create a community we're trying to harken part of the town center you're saying exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7512)|
| 2:05:18| So our group sold a piece of property and donated another piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| Frank is correct. There were in the original plans where the school was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7524)|
| 2:05:30| Plans that we didn't produce but were plans that we inherited there were plans for multifamily and for rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7530)|
| 2:05:37| multifamily rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| And I want to point out again that that was I can't remember exactly how much would have been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| I saw one plan that was over 300 units. I saw another plan. That was only a hundred and ninety units, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7546)|
| 2:05:52| But the plan on the property in question that was approved was for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| 160 townhomes that would have backed right up to the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| Mr. Sligo is correct based on the last plan that I saw that there is an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| That's only 10 feet from property line to curb line in the in the plans that floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7568)|
| 2:06:14| No, I has my argument would be that you what they are planning to plant there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| When that is planted, even if there is a curb line and there is parking for those residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| They will not be able to see that parking from their home. In fact what they would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| After this fact would probably be a whole lot better visually than what they have seen for the last 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| You're gonna plant a green screen. You said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| Exactly the keep in mind when you talk about density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| When you talk about density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| part of the whole town center concept and part of the new urbanism concept is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| For pockets of much higher density. That's part of the not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| The density part but to make it look and feel more of the old-time community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| It is with taller structures. That's why we have scaled back the density on the rest of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| We've got a six acre lake and we're getting ready to try to do commercial and restaurant around that lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7633)|
| 2:07:20| That would be perfectly in keeping with the town center concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| I think that this plan that Flournoy is talking about is the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| There's going to be a lot of green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| the density on this particular tract would not be an issue if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| whole thing had been town center and it was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| divided between two ownership groups and that was simply a fluke of the way the original owners financed theirs and then when they went under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7660)|
| 2:07:47| How the notes ended up getting sold at auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| Well, I got you there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| What about the comment that they they could put these apartments to the east and I don't know where that maybe land outside of your turf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| I don't know, but they were saying there are plenty of places to put a lot of dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| Activity that would feed the town center. Well with all due respect the plans that we had been working on on our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7683)|
| 2:08:11| Involved more of the office and retail component and we even looked at doing apartments on some of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7691)|
| 2:08:20| behind our commercial property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| we feel like the best plan right now is to keep that as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| zero lot line housing single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| which is I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| Might have you seen how close their houses are to each other. They're a lot closer than 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| And by the way, I would venture to say a lot of neighborhoods that are considered quote-unquote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| Single-family residential you may have your neighbor's driveway a lot closer than 10 feet to your property line. Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7726)|
| 2:08:55| Thank You councilman Wallace, thank you mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| Well here again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| There's another tough issue and a lot of a lot of parts that you don't wouldn't normally see on a typical rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| but what we're asked for tonight is whether to push this back to MPC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| and for their reconsideration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| Took some time this week went back out and met with Brad Salisbury at Canon Canon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| Look at these plans and bigger than we had a little little even bigger than what we were presented tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| But it is three-story up against North Shore town North Shore landing. It's three-story there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7765)|
| 2:09:32| It's probably a hundred feet from the house to the building building the building. It's a little over a hundred feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| So it's you know, it is ten feet off the property line, but it's still a good ways away from the building building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| it's three-story on that on that back side and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| And I think his parking exceeds what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| Code requires if I understand his drawing here. He's presented it requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| 336 spaces and he's providing 425| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| So I think there's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| And we're not here to vote on it the zoning tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| we're here to vote on whether to send it back to MPC and I think that's a clear distinction and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| And indeed if it comes back then we'll have another then we will talk about whether to you know to approve or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7810)|
| 2:10:16| So I intend to support pushing it back to MPC and SNM as a councilman grief recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7816)|
| 2:10:24| Thank You councilman camping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| No, I don't I don't have much to say here I'd you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7827)|
| 2:10:33| We've had a significant change in plan. I mean more than anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| I really would love to support this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| It's I mean intensity the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| It seems like a great place for it, but we we you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| These people the community that lives nearby there were promised something there was a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7846)|
| 2:10:51| There was a concept just because that didn't work. It just seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| Unfortunate to change horses midstream. I think the apartments were planned to be up on the hill previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| There was some downsizing and development going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7861)|
| 2:11:05| towards that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| You know, I believe we need to honor that and something something good will come out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| I don't think the development is going to crash because you know, we're not putting an extra 80 units in it. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=7873)|

| 2:13:32| Original concept of what was started there has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8012)|

| 2:13:53| and they're the ones that are agreeing that the density down here as long as this developer follows the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8033)|
| 2:14:01| Guidelines of the of the town center there in favor of that this developer has agreed to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8041)|

| 2:14:22| Thing and that the residents have not been involved those residents that are directly affected which live within the North Shore town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8062)|
| 2:14:29| But I would like to call the question madam, right? So there's no other lights. We'll go ahead and vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8069)|

| 2:26:22| At the public meeting last week up at the church. There's actually three bridges alone or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8782)|
| 2:26:28| There's another one just west of where the end of this project ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| Where the water comes underneath Westland Drive, so it crosses from the south side over to the north side and the lady spoke out and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8793)|

| 2:26:47| I've seen got the signs that are there on both sides of the culvert and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| She says her property floods, too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| I just wondered why that wasn't taken into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| You know when we're tearing up their whole road and can it be added in and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| Can we take care of that at the same time if you want it to last another couple more years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8818)|
| 2:27:03| We could probably add it in. It's one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| Creeping scope expansion. I mean where it's it's a where do you stop that particular one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| The the judgment of the consultant was that it was more a debris problem than it was a capacity problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8832)|
| 2:27:19| So we're gonna get it on the list of public service to maintain it on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8839)|
| 2:27:25| Should take care of the problem if it doesn't I guess we'll probably be back in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8845)|
| 2:27:30| And just seeing that it's sensors. So it's right there. I mean, it's like 10 feet outside the boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| I mean, it was just barely outside. I mean, I don't know where you stop, but that's she brought the complaint and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| And and and I I agree that that that should that could have been a consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| But this project already grew a couple of times by fairly significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| But I mean it was when it first started one reason this has taken so long is that when it first started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| It was a much smaller scope. And as we got into it, we realized that this other bridge this other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8879)|
| 2:28:07| Curve up the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| Could be taken care of at the same time and it's just a matter of where you stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| There's there I mean, there's other alignment issues on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| We I mean we could spend several million dollars there and several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| Several more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| Yeah, and there's not a lot of real estate there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| I realize that but I think it's an it points to the it points to the need for me that there should be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8907)|
| 2:28:34| Strict guidelines and we're doing this roads improvement like that that sidewalk should be accounted for in the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8914)|
| 2:28:39| I mean, yeah, it makes it bigger but now it's the time to do it when you got it all torn up, too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8919)|
| 2:28:42| Well, you're gonna have to close Westland Drive again to fix that third culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| And the sidewalk issue was a part of the discussion all along the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8928)|
| 2:28:56| The expansion of these culverts allows sidewalk in the future when we do have have funding there was some opposition in the neighborhood to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8936)|
| 2:29:04| putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8944)|
| 2:29:05| sidewalk in so that was not a slam-dunk by any means and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| it it would add a significant amount of cost to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8951)|
| 2:29:16| To the project to go ahead and do it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8956)|

| 2:29:31| We probably would have gone in but there was a significant amount of opposition to the idea oddly enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140218?start=8971)|
