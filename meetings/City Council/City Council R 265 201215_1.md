| 3:08:23| Yet all around, growth was occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| There were dog fairs and dog parks and fancy apartment, ball fields and bike trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11306)|
| 3:08:31| Even a hotel and museum was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| Yet in that one section, time had stood still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| The elders would say there once thrived a community that had been taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11317)|
| 3:08:42| The child would grow up and die, another taking its place, having never been given opportunity or space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11322)|
| 3:08:50| This generation after never would see that their people could be as prosperous and successful as their ancestors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11330)|
| 3:08:57| For you see, darkness fell long ago in the guise of removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11337)|
| 3:09:02| Oh, excuse me, renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| For you see, in the bowels of that infrastructure lie the remains of black businesses, homes and churches, never to be seen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11344)|
| 3:09:14| Yet to this day remain the elders of old crying out in the wind, the story forgotten and untold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11354)|
| 3:09:21| As our griots stand on the summit, they hear the martyrs cry out from the heavens above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11361)|
| 3:09:27| Matthew 2540 in all of its glory and the cries reaching the ears of Knoxvillians still say to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11367)|
| 3:09:35| How long before we are avenged for the loss of our might?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11375)|
| 3:09:39| How long before the great wrongs are made right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| How long before our children can see true daylight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11382)|
| 3:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| Thank you, Ms. Sheik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11389)|
| 3:09:52| The next person signed up to speak is Mr. Theotis Robinson, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11392)|
| 3:09:59| Mr. Robinson, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| And is Mr. Robinson on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11403)|
| 3:10:06| Yes, ma'am, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11406)|
| 3:10:07| I've enabled him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| He needs to unmute himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11411)|
| 3:10:12| Mr. Robinson is a former member of the City Council at the tail end of the time of urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11412)|
| 3:10:19| So I'm looking for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11419)|
| 3:10:21| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11421)|
| 3:10:22| Mr. Robinson, can you speak and make sure we can hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11422)|
| 3:10:31| Ma'am, I've asked him to unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| He doesn't hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11437)|
| 3:10:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11438)|
| 3:10:39| Okay, Mr. Robinson, we can hear you if you can just start by saying your name and address for the record and then three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11439)|
| 3:10:44| My name is Theotis Robinson, Jr., and I live at 508 Union Avenue, Unit 506, approximately six-tenths of a mile from where I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11444)|
| 3:10:55| My family lived at 721 Acres Place, the site of the Knoxville Civic Auditorium Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11455)|
| 3:11:02| Fifty years ago, I sat where you now sit, making decisions about the future of our great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11462)|
| 3:11:09| Acres Place was a unique neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| I attended MacMillan School, which no longer exists, and later Green School, just west of the current present-day Green Magnet School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11471)|
| 3:11:21| Most of the families on Acres Place owned their homes, as did my parents, Alma and Theotis Robinson, Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11481)|
| 3:11:29| But then came an urban renewal project, just one of several, which swept away not only Acres Place, of which I have many fond memories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11489)|
| 3:11:37| but also Church Street, where my late friend Avon Rawlings lived, and several additional streets with multiple homes, businesses, and churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11497)|
| 3:11:46| One such church was Macedonia Baptist Church, where I was baptized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11506)|
| 3:11:51| Not one homeowner, not one business owner or church was paid equitable value to compensate for being uprooted from our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11511)|
| 3:12:01| What was lost could not be replaced with the meager dollars afforded because their worth was undervalued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11521)|
| 3:12:07| Families and businesses struggled to compensate for the difference between what was lost and what was required to replace them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11527)|
| 3:12:16| And now, more than half a century later, we meet in this place to reckon with the economic injustice wrought more than half a century ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11536)|
| 3:12:25| Tonight, you are called upon to make amends for the actions of your predecessors, for their lack of vision, for their lack of consciences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11545)|
| 3:12:33| This resolution, presented by Vice Mayor Gwen McKenzie, affords you the opportunity to begin to make things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11553)|
| 3:12:41| Councilwoman McKenzie sits in the seat I once occupied when the Morningside Urban Renewal Project was considered and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11561)|
| 3:12:49| In that program, we moved from paying market value for homes to paying replacement value for homes, which made a huge difference in equity for Black families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11569)|
| 3:13:01| In the Morningside Urban Renewal Project, we moved from total home removal to replacement with the construction of 200 new brick homes and two senior citizen complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11581)|
| 3:13:12| And we moved from total removal to renovation where possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11592)|
| 3:13:16| What Vice Mayor McKenzie is asking is appropriate as a good first step for addressing past misdeeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11596)|
| 3:13:24| I would add to her proposal the need for the city to invest city dollars into the funding mix since the city was a part of acquiring these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11604)|
| 3:13:34| There are other steps our city government will need to take in the days ahead to ensure equal economic opportunities for all our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11614)|
| 3:13:43| not the least of which is the proposed building of a baseball stadium and entertainment complex with its many inherent economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11623)|
| 3:13:52| And tonight, I stand with Vice Mayor Gwen McKenzie in calling on you to approve this resolution. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11632)|
| 3:14:00| Thank you, Mr. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| Next person to speak is Tanisha Baker. Ms. Baker, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11642)|
| 3:14:07| I am, I believe. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11647)|
| 3:14:12| Yes, you can start by saying your name and address for the record and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11652)|
| 3:14:17| My name is Tanisha Baker at 1036 Pleasant Knoll Avenue here in Knoxville 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11657)|
| 3:14:25| So I want to first thank you all for allowing all of us to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11665)|
| 3:14:30| And particularly as we find this issue important as a person of color, I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11670)|
| 3:14:39| And I want to offer my support and encouragement of the proposed resolution presented by Vice Mayor McKenzie that will allow Knoxville to become a city that allows all citizens to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11679)|
| 3:14:51| As I review the content of the proposal, I understand it's not an attempt to change the past because we know we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11691)|
| 3:14:58| But it's about fixing the future and investing in a group of citizens that have suffered long-term effects of policies and actions and structures that have led to inequities to access and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11698)|
| 3:15:11| Additionally, it has limited the ability to gain measurable economic wealth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11711)|
| 3:15:18| So when all citizens have equitable access and opportunity to quality of life, economic power, equitable physical and mental health resources, the city as a whole becomes more attractive and welcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11718)|
| 3:15:32| Knoxville will then attract people and businesses that find value in diversity and that show evidence of investments in all communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11732)|
| 3:15:40| There are facts about our city that are concerning as it relates to outcomes of your citizens of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11740)|
| 3:15:46| The disparities and challenges have remained long enough to indicate that previous or current actions are not sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11746)|
| 3:15:54| And it will take an aggressive, collective and intentional response to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11754)|
| 3:15:59| And I understand that there are rarely, if any, perfect solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| An effort to delay this is an attempt to make it more perfect is not reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11764)|
| 3:16:11| This idea may be met with skepticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11771)|
| 3:16:14| There are those that will oppose the resolution simply because of predicting failure and not wanting what has seemed to be the pattern, a symbolic investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11774)|
| 3:16:24| But what we need is real buy-in, something that is tangible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11784)|
| 3:16:29| So I appeal to you to break the patterns of the past and facilitate tangible change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11789)|
| 3:16:36| Some have very little faith, but I, for one, still hold on to some hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11796)|
| 3:16:42| I'm holding on to the belief in better days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11802)|
| 3:16:45| So I ask that you be a part of the healing that will restore hope for those that truly believe that it is impossible to embrace progressive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11805)|
| 3:16:55| Although there have been some disappointments and letdowns before, I hope this is not one of those times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11815)|
| 3:17:01| This is a chance for you to choose and provide evidence of your values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11821)|
| 3:17:07| On behalf of those that have suffered, have felt reduced and stifled, for those that want to create a city that values all, I appeal for you to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11827)|
| 3:17:19| As elected official, oh, am I done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11843)|
| 3:17:24| I have my three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11844)|
| 3:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11845)|
| 3:17:26| I appreciate you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11846)|
| 3:17:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11847)|
| 3:17:28| Thank you, Ms. Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| Next person signed up to speak is Mr. Zimbabwe Montalvo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11850)|
| 3:17:38| Mayor, I've enabled him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11858)|
| 3:17:41| He's phoning in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11861)|
| 3:17:42| He needs to hit star six on his phone to unmute himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11862)|
| 3:17:46| Go ahead and announce yourself when you hit star six, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11866)|
| 3:17:54| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11874)|
| 3:17:55| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11875)|
| 3:17:56| Go ahead, and if you could state your name and address for the record, and then you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11876)|
| 3:18:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11880)|
| 3:18:02| Zimbabwe Montalvo, 1828 McCall Avenue, Knoxville, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11882)|
| 3:18:10| My statement will be brief because everything that has been said has sufficiently covered any position I would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11890)|
| 3:18:21| I simply say vote for the resolution, understanding this is an initial step, and let's in concert move with great haste to redress those things that happened and that are continuing, and that is what I have to say tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11901)|
| 3:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11921)|
| 3:18:42| Thank you, Mr. Montalvo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11922)|
| 3:18:44| We appreciate your brevity as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11924)|

| 3:18:48| Dr. Kessler, is the next person signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11928)|
| 3:18:53| Reverend Kessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11933)|
| 3:18:56| Hi, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11936)|
| 3:18:57| Thank you so much, and thank you, Mayor, for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| Thank you to the City Council, and a special great thank you to Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11944)|
| 3:19:05| I'm Reverend Rene Kessler, 2327 Woodbine Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11945)|

| 3:19:12| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11952)|

| 3:19:17| Beck was established as a result of the destruction to the Black community in Knoxville by urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11957)|
| 3:19:24| In Knoxville, the first building was demolished in 1959, but long before the first building came down, the spirit of a people was torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11964)|
| 3:19:33| When Title I of the Housing Act of 1949 began, so began the destruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11973)|
| 3:19:38| High School Elementary School was located in urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11978)|
| 3:19:42| In 1949, the school went to the 6th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11982)|
| 3:19:45| After 1950, when the 6th graders graduated, the school eliminated the 6th grade and it only went to the 5th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11985)|
| 3:19:51| The following year, the 4th, the 3rd, the 2nd, until only one grade was left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11991)|
| 3:19:57| Students worried about what was happening to their school, what was happening to their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=11997)|
| 3:20:02| Again, long before the first building came down during urban renewal, the spirit of the people was torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12002)|
| 3:20:09| Churches were another very important part of the Black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| Many would not survive urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| Some churches would split, others would struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12014)|
| 3:20:17| Twice, the government would exercise its authority to remove a church, Shiloh Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12017)|
| 3:20:24| Shiloh was organized in 1865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12024)|
| 3:20:27| At that time, the later church was built on the corner of West Clinch Avenue and Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12027)|
| 3:20:32| That edifice was served there until 1928 when the government, the city of Knoxville, purchased it along with some other nearby buildings for the purpose of widening Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12032)|
| 3:20:43| The gym theater at the corner of East Vine Avenue and Central Street served as a temporary place for worship for this congregation until they located it East Church Avenue at Lithgow Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12043)|
| 3:20:53| When that was completed, by September of 1965, the government came in again and the church had to close its doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12053)|
| 3:21:01| Shiloh mentioned in their anniversary that they had been organized since 1865, but once again, now urban renewal had closed them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12061)|
| 3:21:12| Today, the church still operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12072)|
| 3:21:14| It was able to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12074)|
| 3:21:16| Buford Delaney and his family were all uprooted in urban renewal with their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12076)|
| 3:21:21| I want to close with my last minute to acknowledge there's only one Black business that has survived urban renewal, and that's Jernigan & Son Mortuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12081)|
| 3:21:29| It was devastating to the Black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| I promised Nikki Giovanni that I would read a snippet from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12091)|

| 3:22:04| We were living in that community because white folks didn't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12124)|
| 3:22:07| It separated whites from Blacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| Until, as usual, whites saw we had made a loving community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12129)|
| 3:22:13| Then they wanted to break it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| You sometimes wonder when they will get enough of throwing what they don't want away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12135)|
| 3:22:19| Then watching our love build something special and grabbing it back to feel the foundation our love had created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12139)|

| 3:22:41| Mr. Booker, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| Mayor, I've enabled him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| He also needs to hit star six on his telephone and to unmute himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12165)|
| 3:22:51| Okay. Mr. Booker, if you could hit star six and then we'll all be able to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12171)|
| 3:23:05| If you hit star six and then say that you're on, then we know that we can hear you and you can speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12185)|
| 3:23:15| He's unmuted himself. Can you hear us, Mr. Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12195)|
| 3:23:25| Well, Mr. Johnson, maybe you could work with him on the technical difficulties while we go to the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12205)|
| 3:23:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12211)|
| 3:23:33| The next person signed up to speak is Johnny Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12213)|
| 3:23:37| Reverend Skinner, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12217)|
| 3:23:47| I wish we could meet in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12227)|
| 3:23:51| Reverend Skinner, can you see him, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12231)|
| 3:23:57| Yes, ma'am. He needs to unmute himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12237)|
| 3:23:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| Reverend Skinner, if you hit star six and then announce yourself, we'll know that you can hear us and we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12241)|
| 3:24:07| My name is Johnny William Skinner, 4425 Laura Gold Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12247)|
| 3:24:21| Thank you. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| Well, I just want to say that I'm in full support of the resolution being presented by Vice Mayor Wynn McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12263)|
| 3:24:35| The only thing I have to say, I'm sorry it took so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12275)|
| 3:24:39| I've been in Knoxville now for 29 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12279)|
| 3:24:43| I came from New York to be here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12283)|
| 3:24:51| And I used to work with an organization called Bank on New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12291)|
| 3:24:59| They were against redlining, which did not put economic power into the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12299)|
| 3:25:09| And I hope that the city council will support this resolution so that we can move forward as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12309)|
| 3:25:21| And so our young people will not have to leave Knoxville to find better living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12321)|
| 3:25:29| Many of my young people in my church, Mount Zion Baptist Church, which was founded in 1860,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12329)|
| 3:25:35| they had to leave Knoxville in order to find better jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12335)|
| 3:25:41| And it reminds me of something that Felix Rowerton, who helped build New York City out in the 70s, said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12341)|
| 3:25:49| He said no person graduating from high school in New York should have to go to Dallas, Texas to find a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12349)|
| 3:25:59| And a lot of my young people had to go to other cities to find the kind of job for which they qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12359)|
| 3:26:07| So I'm supporting the Honorable Vice Mayor Wynn McKenzie and this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12367)|
| 3:26:17| And I hope that the city council will support it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12377)|
| 3:26:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12381)|
| 3:26:23| Thank you, Reverend Spinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| Mr. Johnson, if Mr. Booker is online, we can go back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12385)|
| 3:26:31| Just let me know when he's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| We could circle back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12393)|
| 3:26:35| Dr. Kessler is helping to get him connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12395)|
| 3:26:37| Right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| Or should we wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| I think they're still working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| So I think we can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| Next person signed up to speak is Ms. Deborah Ingram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| Ms. Ingram, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| I am. Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| Please state your name and address and you'll have up to three minutes to address the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12413)|
| 3:26:57| My name is Deborah Ingram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| Address is 3919 Porter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| I am the current president of Burlington Resident Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12421)|
| 3:27:07| And I had a whole speech written out, but right now I just really kind of want to speak from the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12427)|
| 3:27:13| Vice Mayor, I want to go ahead and thank you and appreciate you for bringing this concept to fruition and kind of into our space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12433)|
| 3:27:23| However, I don't believe the content of the proposal is where it needs to be in order to meet the needs of those who have been moved by urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12443)|
| 3:27:37| So I had a few things that I did want to speak on in regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12457)|
| 3:27:43| And also just to note, this is something that I've been mentioning, and I'm sure my parents have been mentioning, as well as our grandparents have been mentioning for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12463)|
| 3:27:53| We have an issue with the trust of the city and the people at this point, especially the Black people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12473)|
| 3:28:01| I oppose this proposal until there's some amendments made to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12481)|
| 3:28:09| Because the apology, one, is not going to feel as genuine as it would if the city has more buy-in to this program or this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12489)|
| 3:28:21| Meaning the funds that we're trying to allocate from federal funds or federal grants, that's not going to be enough for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12501)|
| 3:28:29| When this urban renewal happened twice, at least that we can count in our history of this city, it didn't, as a previous speaker just now said, it didn't happen just right when the first building was torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12509)|
| 3:28:43| It happened prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| The breakdown of the people were a mental breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12525)|
| 3:28:49| And if you don't understand, that can cause PTSD to a person, especially when it involves their income and their livelihoods of their family and their children and their own children's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12529)|
| 3:29:01| So, right now, until there are amendments made, there's not enough money in this budget to rectify and fix and correct the things that needs to be corrected for our future and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12541)|
| 3:29:13| I also want to add that what I always tell my son, I have a 13-year-old, recent 13-year-old teenage child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12553)|
| 3:29:23| I've told him since he's been on the campus with me at Tennessee State University prior to my graduation in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12563)|
| 3:29:31| Be accountable. Be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| And right now, I can't say that this city in the past, the present, and I'm afraid of the future has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12573)|
| 3:29:42| I would love for you all to be a little more accountable and to communicate with the community a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12582)|
| 3:29:47| Because I haven't gotten to speak with you, many of you, if I've already contacted you, especially the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12587)|
| 3:29:53| But Vice Mayor McKenzie, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12593)|
| 3:29:56| And I thank you very much for the proposal, but change it a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12596)|
| 3:30:00| Thank you, Ms. Ingram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12600)|
| 3:30:03| Next person who signed up to speak, is Mr. Booker available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12603)|
| 3:30:08| I think he might. Yeah, I think they're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12608)|
| 3:30:11| Mr. Booker, if you can announce yourself, then we'll know that you can hear us and we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12611)|
| 3:30:20| You can go, Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12620)|
| 3:30:22| All right. Mrs. Baum, can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12622)|
| 3:30:25| Yes, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12625)|
| 3:30:26| And please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12626)|
| 3:30:28| You have up to three minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12628)|
| 3:30:35| Okay, go ahead, Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12635)|
| 3:30:37| And start by saying your address, if you would, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12637)|
| 3:30:41| Your address, Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12641)|
| 3:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12642)|
| 3:30:43| This is Bob Booker at 2621 Parkview in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12643)|
| 3:30:49| And I'd like to give an historical perspective of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12649)|
| 3:30:55| For 89 years, blacks in Knoxville were at the mercy of segregation laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12655)|
| 3:31:01| Race relations here were good, but never fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12661)|
| 3:31:05| From 1875 to 1964, the city of Knoxville enforced state laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12665)|
| 3:31:11| and its own ordinances that kept the lives of black people separate from the general population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12671)|
| 3:31:18| We were first arrived in the back of the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12678)|
| 3:31:21| sitting in separate waiting rooms at the bus stations and train stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12681)|
| 3:31:25| We were restricted from treatment at three of the city's main hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12685)|
| 3:31:30| There were no seats for us at the movie theaters except a balcony at the Bijou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12690)|
| 3:31:36| There were no rooms for us at the hotels and motels, and white restaurants were off limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12696)|
| 3:31:42| Until the mid-1950s, blacks could not read a book at Lawson McGee Library that was owned by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12702)|
| 3:31:50| Because of those restrictions and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12710)|
| 3:31:52| the black community had to create its own business and social society that proved successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12712)|
| 3:32:00| Just before urban renewal began, it had 9 taxi companies, 21 cafes and grills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12720)|
| 3:32:08| 9 billiard ballers and pool beer tappers, 16 beauty shops, 8 barbershops, and 5 dry cleaners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12728)|
| 3:32:16| just to name a few of the 107 viable businesses that were destroyed by urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12736)|
| 3:32:24| Urban renewal left nothing to pass on to descendants of at least two generations since those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12744)|
| 3:32:32| Those urban renewal projects that began in 1958 destroyed all but one of those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12752)|
| 3:32:39| Through the laws of eminent domain, the property owners were given fair market value for their assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12759)|
| 3:32:45| But that was totally inadequate to successfully relocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12765)|
| 3:32:49| Homeowners were put into debt trying to buy another house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12769)|
| 3:32:53| Many renters lost the pride of housekeeping by being forced into public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12773)|
| 3:32:59| 14 of the city's well-established black churches were uprooted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12779)|
| 3:33:04| 8 built new structures, 6 moved into abandoned white churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12784)|
| 3:33:09| The members struggled with a church note, a house note, and the effort to re-establish the business, which proved to be impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12789)|
| 3:33:18| The iconic Carnegie Library, where I read my first book, fell under a wrecking ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12798)|
| 3:33:24| The clinics and medical buildings of Dr. Green and Dr. Presto, where they were forced to practice because they couldn't practice at Knoxville General, were destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12804)|
| 3:33:35| A motel, two hotels, and several tourist homes that accommodated black tourists were put out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12815)|
| 3:33:43| Indeed, urban renewals were operated and controlled by the city of Knoxville that largely used federal funds to achieve their goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12823)|
| 3:33:53| They went too far, and the black community has never recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12833)|
| 3:33:58| And I think this resolution could be a start in that recovery, and I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12838)|
| 3:34:04| Thank you, Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12844)|
| 3:34:06| Next person who signed up to speak is Mayor Dan Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12846)|
| 3:34:12| Mayor Brown, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| Yes. Can you hear me all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12854)|
| 3:34:19| Yep. I think you know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| Okay. You can't hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12861)|
| 3:34:24| We can hear you, so if you could just start by stating your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12864)|
| 3:34:28| We can hear you. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12868)|
| 3:34:31| Yeah. Daniel Brown, 2318 Dillon Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12871)|
| 3:34:37| To Mayor Ken Cannon and members of Council, I have the honor to serve with one of you, and that was Councilman Charles Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12877)|
| 3:34:48| And I want to thank all of you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| I'm here tonight to express my support for the resolution brought forward by Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12891)|
| 3:34:59| This is indeed a historic night for our city, and as a former mayor and first African American mayor of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12899)|
| 3:35:09| I have experienced local history directly and also served two terms on the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12909)|
| 3:35:16| I am well aware of the thought process in a somewhat controversial matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12916)|
| 3:35:22| Race is a subject we prefer not to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12922)|
| 3:35:26| However, in order to be fair and equitable to all our citizens, we must discuss this problem forthrightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12926)|
| 3:35:36| I urge those of you on Council to support this resolution, as it will go a long way towards ensuring justice and equality in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12936)|
| 3:35:48| I am a fifth-generation resident of Knoxville, dating back to my great-great-grandmother, Lizzie Robinson, who was born in Knoxville in 1825.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12948)|
| 3:36:03| A major investment in the underserved community would, in the long term, improve the economic and social well-being of all of our citizens, and is long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12963)|
| 3:36:18| I thank you for listening. I want to thank Vice Mayor McKenzie for her work on this resolution, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12978)|
| 3:36:27| Thank you, Mayor Brown. Next person signed up to speak is Mr. Kent Minow. Mr. Minow, are you on the phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12987)|
| 3:36:35| Yes, I am. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12995)|
| 3:36:38| Yes. Please start by saying your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| Yep. I'm Kent Minow. I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13002)|
| 3:36:48| And the Harvey Broom Group of the Sierra Club would like to thank Vice Mayor Gwen McKenzie for writing this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13008)|
| 3:36:54| Two things we really like. First, it presses us to look closely at our city's past and see the consequences of past actions in the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13014)|
| 3:37:03| And second, it gives us a great opportunity to give definition to the kind of future we'd like to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13023)|
| 3:37:10| When we look at the past, we see, despite a regional culture of segregation, thriving African-American-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13030)|
| 3:37:18| Imagine watching an old silent movie with an all-black cast at the Gem Theater, located, close as I can tell, over First Street, where the dog park is located now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13038)|
| 3:37:27| What would it have been like to stay after the movie and see a performance by Bessie Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13047)|
| 3:37:33| When you plug in an electric car at the Promenade parking lot, look over at the reconstruction work on what was the Cal Johnson building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13053)|
| 3:37:40| try to imagine the businesses that once took place in those now-exposed rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13060)|
| 3:37:45| Mostly, think what our city would be like today if the prosperity of that rising black middle class had been encouraged rather than stamped out by a misguided act of urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13065)|
| 3:37:55| Also, what an environmental delight First Creek and the banks of the Tennessee River near the bottoms might have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13075)|
| 3:38:03| had it been nurtured and managed for green space instead of being paved over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13083)|
| 3:38:08| The more difficult act of imagination is considering a future where those past hopes and dreams are honored and supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13088)|
| 3:38:14| Think of black-owned coffee houses, bars and restaurants, nightclubs, concert halls and movie theaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13094)|
| 3:38:20| What about black-owned construction companies, dentists and optometrists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13100)|
| 3:38:25| Such things have not been totally wiped out, but clearly a lot of economic and cultural development has been seriously hampered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13105)|
| 3:38:32| We all pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13112)|
| 3:38:35| We also believe green spaces are for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| So we imagine the blessings of natural spaces extending throughout Knoxville and Knox County and not just in more prosperous areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13117)|
| 3:38:45| Some folks criticize the timing of this proposal, but we see it as the perfect time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13125)|
| 3:38:50| There's a nationwide commitment to ending racism that's quite visible now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13130)|
| 3:38:54| And when we keep putting off dealing with a chronic problem, it's likely to become a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13134)|
| 3:39:00| This proposal gives us the opportunity to clearly express our intention as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13140)|
| 3:39:05| You folks sit in the chairs your predecessors sat in when the problem was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13145)|
| 3:39:10| Let's change the heritage of racism to one we can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13150)|
| 3:39:14| We not only owe it to our African-American friends and neighbors, but also all of us will be a lot happier in a future without racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13154)|
| 3:39:22| Let's imagine it first and make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13162)|
| 3:39:24| Please vote yes on this resolution to create an African-American equity task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13164)|
| 3:39:29| Thanks for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| Thank you, Mr. Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13171)|
| 3:39:33| Next person who signed up to speak is Sam Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13173)|
| 3:39:35| Mr. Brown, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13175)|
| 3:39:40| Thank you very much, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13180)|
| 3:39:43| This is Sam Brown, 2744 Selma Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13183)|
| 3:39:49| I just want to take this time to commend our Vice Mayor, who just so happens to be my city council representative, for submitting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13189)|
| 3:40:00| Thank you for continuing in the vein of the legacy laid by your father when he came to establish our local Urban League affiliate over 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13200)|
| 3:40:12| So thank you for your hard work today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13212)|
| 3:40:15| I will say to all of our city council members and to you, Mr. Mayor, and to everyone who is listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13215)|
| 3:40:23| this is an opportunity for you all, who are leaders of our city in such a time as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13223)|
| 3:40:30| to make a statement not only to those of us who are experiencing the adverse effects of the atrocities of urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13230)|
| 3:40:41| but you can also make a statement to posterity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13241)|
| 3:40:45| I have the esteemed privilege of pastoring the historic Logan Temple AME Zion Church that was located at Commerce Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13245)|
| 3:40:54| where the now Marble Alley Lofts are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13254)|
| 3:40:58| And I can tell you that we have the opportunity to get quantifiable data that will tell us in specific ways how families were affected adversely by the atrocities of this urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13258)|
| 3:41:15| This is a time for us to make a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13275)|
| 3:41:20| It's a small action to start building bridges, a small action to build relationships, and a small action of impartiality, fairness, and character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13280)|
| 3:41:31| This is a time for us to make an investment in our brothers and sisters, our communities, our neighborhoods, and ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13291)|
| 3:41:39| So I would ask you all to please, please vote yes to pass this resolution for once in the life of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13299)|
| 3:41:49| Let the government make a decision for the right cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13309)|
| 3:41:53| Thank you all so much, and thank you again, Madam Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13316)|
| 3:41:58| The next person signed up to speak is Mr. David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| Mr. Hayes, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13321)|
| 3:42:09| Yep. Can y'all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| Yes, we can. Start, please, by saying your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13331)|
| 3:42:16| Cool. David Hayes, 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13336)|
| 3:42:20| First, I want to say shout out to everybody who spoke before me and anybody speaking behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13340)|
| 3:42:25| Y'all are awesome. I look up to y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13345)|
| 3:42:27| That's what we need. This is the kind of engagement that we need with things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13347)|
| 3:42:30| So it's great to be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13350)|
| 3:42:33| Just want to start off by saying about this resolution, if you vote against this resolution because of this acknowledgement and commitment to Black people, you are willingly promoting racism and white supremacy, point blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13353)|
| 3:42:45| And you should be remembered as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13365)|
| 3:42:48| Now, each of you have the opportunity to do something historic tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13368)|
| 3:42:52| And while this is an historic resolution, it needs more to materially improve the conditions of Black people in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13372)|
| 3:42:59| We've had studies and committees throughout our city's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13379)|
| 3:43:02| We've had recommendations. There's city-sponsored recommendations to reform the administration to be more inclusive to Black people that were never fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13382)|
| 3:43:11| The city has made many promises to East Knoxville and other Black communities that have been broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13391)|
| 3:43:16| Many organizations have done extensive research into community needs and have repeatedly brought so many solutions to deaf ears on council in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13396)|
| 3:43:23| So when I see there's no requirement for the use of these funds, and when I hear that we'll create a task force to do the work, and that's it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13403)|
| 3:43:30| I am heavily skeptical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13410)|
| 3:43:33| Now, committing $100 million in grant money over 10 years, about 10 or exactly $10 million a year, is a nice gesture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13413)|
| 3:43:42| but not nearly enough to address the legacy of white supremacy and the current systemic racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13422)|
| 3:43:48| Now, unless you're the police department, grant money is not guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13428)|
| 3:43:52| So we need a large commitment of local money, especially since it's the city government apologizing for its role in the oppression of Black people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13432)|
| 3:44:00| We need to see that represented on local money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13440)|
| 3:44:03| So we need you all to produce, for the first time ever, I believe, a city budget that would reflect your true commitment to racial equity and the empowerment of Black people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13443)|
| 3:44:12| Again, this is an historic resolution, but ultimately, Black people are still getting crumbs of the pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13452)|
| 3:44:20| So I hope this resolution is the first step in real systemic change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13460)|
| 3:44:24| And again, if you vote against this resolution because of its commitment to Black people, you are willingly promoting racism and white supremacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13464)|
| 3:44:32| So I hope you all will vote yes to this resolution. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13472)|
| 3:44:36| Thank you, Mr. Hayes. The next person signed up to speak is Ms. Artise Slay. Ms. Slay, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13476)|
| 3:44:45| Ms. Artise Slay, are you on the call? If you could unmute yourself and announce that you can hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13485)|
| 3:44:54| Mayor Schneitz to unmute herself. I've enabled her to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13494)|
| 3:44:58| Okay. If she's calling into that, you need to hit star six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13498)|
| 3:45:02| This is Artise Slay. I am on the call. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13502)|
| 3:45:07| We can hear you. If you could just start by stating your name and address for the record, and then you'll have up to three minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13507)|
| 3:45:13| Thank you. I am Artise Slay at 1719 Maple Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13513)|
| 3:45:19| Thank you so much, Mayor Kincannon and City Council, for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13519)|
| 3:45:25| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie, for bringing forth this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13525)|
| 3:45:31| I am for the resolution, and I pose this question. Is there a bomb in Gilead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13531)|
| 3:45:40| I'm from Knoxville. I was born at Fort Sanders Presbyterian Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13540)|
| 3:45:46| I grew up in College Hills, which is now called Ridgebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13546)|
| 3:45:50| It's in between Lonsdale and Mechanicsville, and Knoxville College was right in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13550)|
| 3:45:58| I could hear the band playing when Knoxville College was really alive in its heyday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13558)|
| 3:46:06| If you look at Knoxville College as it stands today, I think it stands as a symbol of the state of the African-American community here in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13566)|
| 3:46:17| It stands as a picture of what it looks like for our community to lose hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13577)|
| 3:46:23| Reverend Kessler spoke about the spirit of our people being broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13583)|
| 3:46:29| and she also informed us that the only business that survived urban renewal was Jarnagan and Sons Mortuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13589)|
| 3:46:39| And isn't it ironic that it's a place where you go to bury the dead that still stands? That is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13599)|
| 3:46:51| I think about the prophet Ezekiel when he was taken up in the spirit by the Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13611)|
| 3:46:59| and the Lord took him into this place where there was a valley full of dried bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13619)|
| 3:47:06| And these bones were so dry. They were so dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13626)|
| 3:47:11| And the Lord spoke to the prophet and asked him, can these bones live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13631)|
| 3:47:18| And the prophet told God, you know whether or not these bones can live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13638)|
| 3:47:25| And so the Lord God told Ezekiel to prophesy to those bones and those bones would live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13645)|
| 3:47:35| And when Ezekiel began to prophesy and commanded those bones to come forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13655)|
| 3:47:42| they came together bone to bone and they stood a strong army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13662)|
| 3:47:50| It was the children of Israel. And what I found out when I read this passage was that those people were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13670)|
| 3:48:03| had the mindset to where they were saying to themselves that their bones were dried and their hope was lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13683)|
| 3:48:11| Ms. Slade, you have just a couple seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13691)|
| 3:48:14| I see that. I see that. I want to say that it's time. It's time to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13694)|
| 3:48:25| Systemic racism and racial injustice doesn't change with money and an apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13705)|
| 3:48:34| It's a good start, but we've got to get to the root of this evil system, expose it and completely destroy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13714)|
| 3:48:41| Thank you. Please vote to approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13721)|
| 3:48:45| Thank you, Ms. Slade. The last person who signed up to speak on this item is John Bosett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13725)|
| 3:48:52| Mr. Bosett, are you on the phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13732)|
| 3:48:56| Yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13736)|
| 3:48:58| Okay, if you could go ahead and start by saying your name and address for the record and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13738)|
| 3:49:03| My name is John Bosett. I live at 7421 Somerset Road, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13743)|
| 3:49:12| Mayor Kincannon and members of the City Council, I come here to urge you to pass Vice Mayor McKenzie's crucial resolution on racial equity restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13752)|
| 3:49:26| But then you need to use your influence to see that this is widely understood and supported in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13766)|
| 3:49:37| Can we join other leading cities like Asheville, North Carolina? I believe we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13777)|
| 3:49:44| I come here as a white resident of West Knoxville who has only late in life become aware of the full systems of injustices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13784)|
| 3:49:56| systems of injustices done for decades to our African-American sisters and brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13796)|
| 3:50:04| What I've become aware of is that these injustices flow not simply from racist attitudes, but even more from systems of white supremacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13804)|
| 3:50:16| systems that we white folks don't even see because we don't have to cope with them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13816)|
| 3:50:23| We are riding in them. And that echoes what MLK said about complacent white moderates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13823)|
| 3:50:30| Even before urban removal, the legal codes of New Deal federal housing programs and bank redlining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13830)|
| 3:50:39| aggravated the huge racial wealth disparities we've already been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13839)|
| 3:50:46| Then, like many other cities, Knoxville did major industry to its black citizens with urban removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13846)|
| 3:50:55| But not only homes and businesses and churches were destroyed, it destroyed the black communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13855)|
| 3:51:03| that sustained the lives of thousands of black Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13863)|
| 3:51:08| Together with such things as underfunded public schools, racial discrimination in criminal justice and school discipline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13868)|
| 3:51:17| unequal access to mortgages and on and on, baked in legal and economic systems of white supremacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13877)|
| 3:51:26| have advantaged white citizens and disadvantaged black citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13886)|
| 3:51:32| It'll take decades of learning and investment to begin to right the ship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13892)|
| 3:51:42| This resolution commits us to begin that healing by recognizing and exploring racial inequality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13902)|
| 3:51:50| Amazingly, the time is just now right for us to take crucial actions if we manage this new baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13910)|
| 3:51:59| to empower black businesses and neighbors for community benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13919)|
| 3:52:05| So we have a rare opportunity right now to go forward on the path of Vice Mayor McKenzie's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13925)|
| 3:52:14| and make a big contribution to a national reawakening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13934)|
| 3:52:19| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Bossett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13939)|
| 3:52:22| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13942)|
| 3:52:27| And so now it's your opportunity to have a discussion and I'm here to help you manage the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13947)|
| 3:52:37| Who wants to speak and has a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13957)|
| 3:52:43| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13963)|
| 3:52:48| We can't hear you. We need to unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13968)|
| 3:52:57| Try that unmute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13977)|
| 3:53:00| So, Mayor, since you support the resolution, are you then agreeing to the fact that your office is going to work to help implement these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13980)|
| 3:53:11| these things? I mean, I'm trying to figure out the logistics of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13991)|
| 3:53:17| And I'm assuming if you're supporting it, that there is some level of agreement with you and Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=13997)|
| 3:53:25| or is that to be worked out? Like who appoints the task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14005)|
| 3:53:33| Who do they bring the recommendations to? Who applies for the grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14013)|
| 3:53:40| I'm just trying to get some tactical kind of answers, if you can give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14020)|
| 3:53:46| Well, I'll speak first and then Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14026)|
| 3:53:50| I would just say that those details have not been determined, but I do agree with the sentiments and aspirations in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14030)|
| 3:53:59| And, you know, Vice Mayor McKenzie and I have spoken and said, if this is approved by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14039)|
| 3:54:05| that we'd be happy to meet and go over more details and, you know, try to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14045)|
| 3:54:13| create something that council could then review or figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14053)|
| 3:54:17| You know, those are a lot of things. There are a lot of things that have not been determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14057)|
| 3:54:21| We do not have a plan for what the task force would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14061)|
| 3:54:25| But I'll let Vice Mayor McKenzie speak to some more of her ideas that she, why she put that in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14065)|
| 3:54:33| Thank you, Mayor. And so Council Member Fugate, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14073)|
| 3:54:37| That would be some of the discussion for council to have input on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14077)|
| 3:54:41| I absolutely could have brought a full fledged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14081)|
| 3:54:45| Here's how I feel like it should be established and all of the terms and ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14085)|
| 3:54:51| But as a collective body, as a council, I think that's something that we need to all have some input on and recommendations on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14091)|
| 3:54:58| So absolutely. Can I help bring just some framework for us to start the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14098)|
| 3:55:04| Absolutely. And we'll look to my colleagues here on council to work through that as well as with the mayor's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14104)|
| 3:55:13| OK, I mean, I'm not I'm not arguing the point. I'm just trying to figure out the logistics, sort of like we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14113)|
| 3:55:20| about what comes next with the sports authority, what comes next after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14120)|
| 3:55:25| And so so is this a committee of city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14125)|
| 3:55:31| Is the task force a task force of city council or joiner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14131)|
| 3:55:34| That's one of the things that you and the mayor will talk about and bring back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14134)|
| 3:55:39| Yes. And so my initial recommendation would would be that council would get X amount of appointments in the mayor's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14139)|
| 3:55:48| because they also will have to do some work in conjunction as well as with community empowerment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14148)|
| 3:55:54| would have a point would get X amount of appointments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14154)|
| 3:55:57| But again, those are logistics that we would we would start working on together as a council once this is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14157)|
| 3:56:03| OK, thank you. Council member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14163)|
| 3:56:09| Thank you, Mayor. I want to thank Vice Mayor McKenzie for bringing forth this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14169)|
| 3:56:14| I think a lot of thoughts gone into this and I think we've all spent a lot of thought on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14174)|
| 3:56:20| And I thank everybody for speaking just now. And the history, the context is all really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14180)|
| 3:56:28| In reading this and thinking a lot about it, I think of it in two parts. They're connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14188)|
| 3:56:33| But one is about recognition and reconciliation. And I think urban renewal was a federal program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14193)|
| 3:56:43| But Knoxville played its own role in implementing that. And there's a clear connection between the legacy of that and modern poverty among African-Americans in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14203)|
| 3:56:54| So I think it's important that we recognize that. I think that's a very fundamental part of healing and moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14214)|
| 3:57:02| So for that particularly, I'm grateful for Vice Mayor McKenzie for you for bringing that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14222)|
| 3:57:10| The questions I have are more around the second part of this, which is the practical elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14230)|
| 3:57:18| Reducing poverty is a worthy endeavor and we should be committed to it and particularly among the African-American community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14238)|
| 3:57:28| And that's going to require a sustained commitment. And I imagine that's why part of the part of the reason this resolution includes 10 years is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14248)|
| 3:57:37| this isn't a flash in the pan. Addressing this and improving it's going to take a sustained effort and a commitment by all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14257)|
| 3:57:45| So, you know, it's one of the things that I've been advocating for the 100 Knoxville initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14265)|
| 3:57:51| I think there's a lot of good ideas that the task force will come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14271)|
| 3:57:55| But I think springing from the Memphis 800 initiative, that's the type of thing I think where we can invest in investment that lasts a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14275)|
| 3:58:04| So it's similar to Ms. Baker. I really enjoyed her comments earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14284)|
| 3:58:09| I'm optimistic about the task force and I think it needs to be creative and imaginative, but also spring from previous attempts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14289)|
| 3:58:19| And so our previous investments, I should say. And so I think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14299)|
| 3:58:24| I wanted to share that perspective, but also kind of talk about the 100 million because it may take more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14304)|
| 3:58:33| May take less than that. So I'm just curious, Vice Mayor, if you could provide some context about why 100 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14313)|
| 3:58:41| Why 10 years? Talk a little bit about that, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14321)|
| 3:58:45| Absolutely. So why 100 million? You would be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14325)|
| 3:58:52| And I think you've heard some of the comments this evening that 100 million dollars is not enough money to be able to reinvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14332)|
| 3:59:01| When we're talking about breaking cycles of generational poverty, providing opportunities and access for the black community to be able to have opportunities to start now building generational wealth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14341)|
| 3:59:13| There's so many things that go into this, and this is why this task force is going to be so incredibly important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14353)|
| 3:59:18| because we need to make sure that we have people at the table who are passionate about this work, who are going to be looking at strategic solutions, benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14358)|
| 3:59:28| There are a lot of agencies and there's some nonprofits that are already working in some of the lanes, particularly that the task force will be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14368)|
| 3:59:35| I would gather economic empowerment or development, financial literacy and education, early intervention and also health and wellness prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14375)|
| 3:59:46| So that's just my from my lens. But again, this is where I feel like we need to have the task force in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14386)|
| 3:59:53| Let it be a collective body of people from the community, business sector, education sector, financial sector, all of those that are going to be working collaboratively together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14393)|
| 4:00:03| The 10 years, because we need to have a time frame on this on this task force, this commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14403)|
| 4:00:10| This is a very, I mean, dire situation currently when we talk about a 17 percent African-American population with such a high rate of poverty of people living in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14410)|
| 4:00:22| And so this, you know, envision this is going to be a volunteer task force, but they're going to have some really tough decisions and work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14422)|
| 4:00:32| So we need people who are passionate and committed to this fight. The hundred million dollars is it's a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14432)|
| 4:00:40| We don't know what recommendations the task force is going to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14440)|
| 4:00:44| I would assume that the task force is actually going to do a lot of work and research on who who are already working in these lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14444)|
| 4:00:51| What is their capacity? What is their programs look like? Do they need to expand programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14451)|
| 4:00:57| Are there going to be recommendations for them to potentially expand their programs? What would that look like and what would what would that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14457)|
| 4:01:04| So I'm not necessarily saying that the task force has to get out here and reinvent the wheel, because, again, we've had we have people who have been working in these lanes and have been advocating for these issues for quite a quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14464)|
| 4:01:17| And so I'm excited to see a collective group of people at the table in the form of this task force to work specifically on these disparities in the African-American community and those strategic solutions that they will recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14477)|
| 4:01:30| So I hope that I answered your question. If I didn't, if you have a follow up question, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14490)|
| 4:01:36| I really just want to understand your thought process behind the term, the amount and the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14496)|
| 4:01:41| So that that does help. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14501)|
| 4:01:49| Ms. Parker, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14509)|
| 4:01:54| Thank you. And thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie, for bringing this resolution forward and sparking a very important conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14514)|
| 4:02:05| I have some of the same concerns that have already been lifted up by others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14525)|
| 4:02:14| You know, even just in the title of the resolution, I'm concerned it might send the wrong message with the racial equity restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14534)|
| 4:02:28| But, you know, I kind of read it as can we restore our city back to racial equity, back to a time of racial equity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14548)|
| 4:02:42| And, you know, I just don't want to send that message that any effort put forward through through this resolution is an effort to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14562)|
| 4:02:57| to go back 50 years to a time when, but instead, it's a resolution to rectify some of the harms done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14577)|
| 4:03:12| And when I say that, I also want to emphasize that in establishing this, it should not be thought of as the black fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14592)|
| 4:03:23| It's not, you know, the go to pot of money that the city goes to for everything, every black issue in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14603)|
| 4:03:34| This should be a very specific initiative to address the destruction wrought by urban renewal in a very specific part of our city and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14614)|
| 4:03:48| That's one of my major concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14628)|
| 4:03:51| We, as a city, receive federal funding that is already designated to address the disparities in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14631)|
| 4:04:03| That funding needs to stay where it is and continue doing the work that it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14643)|
| 4:04:09| And this needs to be additional funding committed by the city and sought from other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14649)|
| 4:04:17| That's, you know, another one of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14657)|
| 4:04:22| I have the same concern regarding the task force and would just, you know, echo some of some of the concerns that were raised earlier and say, you know, I look forward to more discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14662)|
| 4:04:43| Because it concerns me if the mayor's administration is going to be able to appoint as well as community empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14683)|
| 4:04:51| That's a little overlap, but we have time to discuss those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14691)|
| 4:04:57| And the other thing, you know, is just the amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14697)|
| 4:05:00| Even if we are talking about the investment that the city needs to make to reconcile what happened during urban removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14700)|
| 4:05:12| You know, even that hundred million is a drop in the bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14712)|
| 4:05:18| I think of many of our major corridor projects over the last couple of years, Cumberland Avenue comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14718)|
| 4:05:28| That small little area was at least a couple of hundred million in investment from city and other funds to help revitalize that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14728)|
| 4:05:39| So if we're serious as a city about truly revitalizing, you know, almost a fifth of our community, a hundred million over 10 years is honestly just our should be our basic commitment to our residents of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14739)|
| 4:05:57| It doesn't seem to be a number that goes above and beyond if we're truly trying to revitalize a community as we have in other parts of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14757)|
| 4:06:08| So I'm willing to, you know, support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14768)|
| 4:06:13| I would prefer amendments that would strengthen it a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14773)|
| 4:06:18| But after earlier discussions, I can't imagine we're all on the same page for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14778)|
| 4:06:25| So I will support this resolution, but hope to be able to work to strengthen that and continue to emphasize to our current administration and to future ones that this is an investment that the city must make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14785)|
| 4:06:41| And each budget year, I'm going to be looking for that investment to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14801)|
| 4:06:46| It is something we can easily put into our capital budget, like we have done for other projects, and raise the money, bring it into our current budget as we raise the money and find the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14806)|
| 4:06:58| So I would like to see the city make that type of commitment, even if it's four years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14818)|
| 4:07:04| Let's put, you know, part of this $100 million in our capital budget so we can start to plan towards it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14824)|
| 4:07:16| If I can address that. Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14836)|
| 4:07:19| And I want to definitely look forward to working with you and our other colleagues on council about some of those concerns that you had as it relates to the budget and also the structure of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14839)|
| 4:07:33| But I wanted to speak specifically about the title of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14853)|
| 4:07:38| And when I use the word restoration, it is not about taking us back to where we came from, but it's about healing, that restoration piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14858)|
| 4:07:47| That word was actually used from the context of Mrs. Zimbabwe Mutambu, who has always talked about rescue and restoration of the Black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14867)|
| 4:07:59| And so that word has really resonated with me over the years that has been part of his plight and his fight for the African-American community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14879)|
| 4:08:07| And so in the context that I'm using, it is about healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14887)|
| 4:08:11| It is about restoring that trust that has been broken across the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14891)|
| 4:08:20| I just wanted to thank you for that clarification and offer up one final thought that I forgot to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14900)|
| 4:08:28| Which speaks to the piece that you mentioned, the healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14908)|
| 4:08:37| That's one other thing that I find unfortunate about the timing of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14917)|
| 4:08:45| The fact that we've had to deliberate on this resolution at the same time as this baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14925)|
| 4:08:51| And the fact that the city is in the midst of another period of urban renewal that we are not acknowledging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14931)|
| 4:09:00| We're not acknowledging how it affects our current residents, how it affects our low-income residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14940)|
| 4:09:06| And I am concerned that this will be seen by the public and maybe even adopted by some members of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14946)|
| 4:09:17| As a sign that it's time to move past past harms and to a new and happy future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14957)|
| 4:09:25| But that is not possible if we are in the midst of committing current day harms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14965)|
| 4:09:32| Thank you for sharing your points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14972)|
| 4:09:36| Thank you, Ms. Pfeiffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14976)|
| 4:09:38| Any other questions or comments from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14978)|
| 4:09:42| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14982)|
| 4:09:49| So, thank you for all the dialogue and to all of those who have spoken on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14989)|
| 4:09:58| I do have some questions because it certainly does come, you know, for me from a budgetary perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=14998)|
| 4:10:06| And just a lot of confusion and unclarity about some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15006)|
| 4:10:12| But can you speak to, so you talk about the $100 million and part of the resolution states that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15012)|
| 4:10:21| urges the city to commit to the investment of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15021)|
| 4:10:26| And just really is a top line tally of a lot of investments that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15026)|
| 4:10:32| So, whether it's the Austin Homes Master Plan, the Walter B. Taylor Five Points Master Plan, Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15032)|
| 4:10:39| Morningside Park, Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15039)|
| 4:10:43| I mean, they're, you know, close to a dozen and a half different projects and master plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15043)|
| 4:10:50| A top level accounting right now is about at $44 million that has been invested in this community and the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15050)|
| 4:10:57| And really working, be it infrastructure, be it business investment, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15057)|
| 4:11:05| So, and that doesn't really include programming that's been included, be it through Urban League or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15065)|
| 4:11:13| other initiatives, workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15073)|
| 4:11:17| You know, that also includes Change Center, Cal Johnson Rec Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15077)|
| 4:11:22| So, I'm really curious of that $100 million, how much of what we've already invested, have invested or currently investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15082)|
| 4:11:34| and have already promised to invest counts toward that $100 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15094)|
| 4:11:42| So, Council Member Testerman, you're kind of leaning into Council Member Parker's former statement that she made previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15102)|
| 4:11:55| about there being some, not being very clear about this investment versus existing investments that have already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15115)|
| 4:12:04| I would not include investments in parks and greenway spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15124)|
| 4:12:09| Primarily, what we're going to be looking at is direction from this task force that, in my opinion, would be very specific toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15129)|
| 4:12:16| people investment, job opportunities, job training programs, things that are going to specifically enhance a person's opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15136)|
| 4:12:25| or abilities to be able to get living wage jobs, be able to work themselves out of their current state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15145)|
| 4:12:34| which a lot, again, we know that is a higher percentage of people living at poverty rate that are people of color in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15154)|
| 4:12:42| And so, again, I don't want to speak for the task force and what solutions that they may come up with in addition to what we've already seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15162)|
| 4:12:50| invested, but the investments that have been made up to this point will not be included in this new commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15170)|
| 4:12:57| So this $100 million then are new dollars, so nothing that's been committed or not that's been allocated and not even spent up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15177)|
| 4:13:08| is not included. So it's $100 million of new dollars that we're looking at. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15188)|
| 4:13:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15194)|
| 4:13:16| And, you know, again, I mean, I'm about, you know, lifting everyone up. I mean, you know, the Urban League has done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15196)|
| 4:13:24| Stan Johnson with SEED, the apprenticeship program that he has going, you know, on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15204)|
| 4:13:30| I mean, I think there are great programs that with Daris Upton and his diversity inclusion and working through Project GRAD and apprenticeship programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15210)|
| 4:13:40| and trying to develop corporate partners. I think there are a lot of opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15220)|
| 4:13:46| You know, I will just say my greatest concern, you know, putting the onus on the Community Empowerment Department from a grant standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15226)|
| 4:13:58| if we're looking at $10 million new dollars a year to come up with federal and state grants, local grants, that is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15238)|
| 4:14:07| And that's assuming those grant dollars are there. And I guess my questions are, you know, A, understanding grants and understanding how competitive grants are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15247)|
| 4:14:20| If the bulk of these dollars are coming from that, you know, that takes, you know, a lot of manpower to be able to write those, to apply for them, to look for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15260)|
| 4:14:32| providing those dollars are even available. And, you know, and I guess my question is what, you know, what are the consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15272)|
| 4:14:42| Should the department, you know, fail to secure these grants in a given year, do no fault to their own if those dollars don't exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15282)|
| 4:14:50| And I guess, too, my biggest question is, you know, can you share what are the benchmarks for success when it comes to these dollar expenditures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15290)|
| 4:15:01| You know, kind of understanding what the end game is, what the goals are. I understand the overarching to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15301)|
| 4:15:09| But when you're putting dollars to tangibles, I'm just trying to have a better understanding of what these benchmarks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15309)|
| 4:15:20| So, yeah, so first and foremost, and thank you for sharing your questions and your viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15320)|
| 4:15:28| The first benchmark that I think that we all can attest to would be that high poverty rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15328)|
| 4:15:34| That would be one that would be a goal to say that, yes, we want a commitment and we want strategic solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15334)|
| 4:15:40| And we want to be able to track those things to make sure that they are impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15340)|
| 4:15:44| Those those solutions that are going to be recommended by the task force as it relates to the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15344)|
| 4:15:51| Absolutely. It's work to to apply for grants and to provide all of the requirements that may go with reporting that goes with the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15351)|
| 4:15:59| So this is part of where this conversation and partnership with the city administration, with the mayor's administration will come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15359)|
| 4:16:07| Does community empowerment have have the capacity to be able to to do the work with their current staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15367)|
| 4:16:14| That may be something that has to be looked at. Also, in the context of this one hundred million dollar investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15374)|
| 4:16:21| there's also the ability for private investment where people can invest privately into this fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15381)|
| 4:16:27| And there's also the ability, as Council Member Parker was speaking to, for us to be able to allocate some city operating dollars into support, supporting this, this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15387)|
| 4:16:40| And so we as a council are going to have to be able to have some conversations and work toward what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15400)|
| 4:16:48| Again, with the structure of the task force, with the funding, we all are going to have some skin in the game as well as we should as a city government body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15408)|
| 4:17:02| Well, thank you for that. I mean, you know, I go back to just a lot of the unknowns and it is a substantial amount of money and ten million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15422)|
| 4:17:15| I mean, it's it's tough. And, you know, having looked at the actual resolution as well, they did pass in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15435)|
| 4:17:24| They've still they tabled even kind of making steps moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15444)|
| 4:17:30| And I know that others are other cities are grappling with the complexities of how this is accomplished, who have done sort of mere resolutions like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15450)|
| 4:17:41| And so, I mean, I'm I'm, you know, certainly about equity and opportunities and am on board with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15461)|
| 4:17:53| I just I have a great deal of questions and would like to better see a collaborative effort with the city and this task force and, you know, who's on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15473)|
| 4:18:06| It talks about a study with the task force. How much is that going to cost? You know, who's on it? Who's going to conduct that study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15486)|
| 4:18:14| What are the dollars anticipated? There's a lot. I mean, there's a lot. This is heavy. It's complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15494)|
| 4:18:21| It's and from a budgetary standpoint and looking at what other cities have done, I've just I continue to have a lot of questions and would like to see more fleshed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15501)|
| 4:18:34| With a collaborative effort with the administration and and how they anticipate moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15514)|
| 4:18:46| And if I may, Mayor. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15526)|
| 4:18:52| Councilman Testament, we referenced the actual resolution. We know that there was a resolution in Durham, North Carolina, Evansville, Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15532)|
| 4:19:01| And so because of those resolutions that I studied also, that was why it was so important that we as a city put forth a dollar amount time frame that would be actionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15541)|
| 4:19:15| Because at the end of the day, when we talk about that type of investment again, I want us to to look back at what has been suffered by people of color in this community, in this city that has unintentionally put them in situations of generational poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15555)|
| 4:19:35| And so this resolution, as it relates to the task force and everything that they need to do, I absolutely could have brought that to to my colleagues today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15575)|
| 4:19:45| However, when we talk about collaboration, I feel like that is part of that collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15585)|
| 4:19:52| Each of us can have input into into what the task force, the appointment of the task force and sits on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15592)|
| 4:19:59| Those are semantics, if you will. And for those who don't care how it how it works out, you also have that opportunity to just say, hey, I'm going to let those of us on the council who have a passion to work on this, make those decisions and we'll be in agreement on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15599)|
| 4:20:14| The mayor made a statement that says that she and her administration are willing to that they support this resolution and working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15614)|
| 4:20:23| And, you know, I cannot speak for the mayor or for the community empowerment department as to whether or not they made it may need an additional resource to be able to help work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15623)|
| 4:20:34| But at this juncture, I would say that whatever is necessary, that I'm compassionate enough and I feel like it's important enough and that the time is now for us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15634)|
| 4:20:43| I will not compare us to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15643)|
| 4:20:47| Knoxville, Tennessee is a unique city, just like Asheville, North Carolina is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15647)|
| 4:20:51| We would have ended this conversation probably an hour ago if all we were asking for today was an apology and an acknowledgement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15651)|
| 4:21:00| But whenever we start talking about anything, real investment in people and helping to better their living conditions and the opportunity and access for generations, for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15660)|
| 4:21:13| This is where the conversation gets very intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15673)|
| 4:21:17| And I applaud the questions. I know that we, you know, we are looking to be financially responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15677)|
| 4:21:23| But I also want to say that if we have a city where we have a population of people who we are not looking at strategically, how can we help better those their conditions as far as employment, health care, early intervention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15683)|
| 4:21:38| Then we are not going to be a city that is going to be able to thrive. All of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15698)|
| 4:21:43| It will not just be specific to the black community, not being able to, but it's going to affect our entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15703)|
| 4:21:48| And so, again, you know, that's a decision each of us have to kind of search our hearts as to what we believe and what we're willing to do as it relates to this to this commitment and this ask as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15708)|
| 4:22:01| So thank you for sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15721)|
| 4:22:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor Kennedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15723)|
| 4:22:05| I would just go to you, Council Member Fugate, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15725)|
| 4:22:10| I just did want to say that we don't have all the answers and it's very it is very complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15730)|
| 4:22:16| And, you know, I also hear that it's not just about infrastructure things, which is what the city sort of specialized infrastructure and capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15736)|
| 4:22:28| But there's an interest in things that are outside of what the city typically does, for example, education and job training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15748)|
| 4:22:34| So maybe as you all consider the composition of the task force, it can consider people in those areas as well, because that's part of wealth building is investing in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15754)|
| 4:22:49| So they have the ability to earn a good living and start their own businesses and have access to capital and all those things that are private sector, business sector, education sector, things that could complement the work that the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15769)|
| 4:23:02| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15782)|
| 4:23:04| Mayor, I was just going to say I had a conversation with a friend of mine that we worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15784)|
| 4:23:11| We've been working to try to improve the city for the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15791)|
| 4:23:15| And if this was easy, it would have already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15795)|
| 4:23:18| This is very hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15798)|
| 4:23:21| If there's no magic bullet, we all keep looking for a magic bullet and there's not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15801)|
| 4:23:28| We've had a micro lending fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15808)|
| 4:23:31| We've had the heart of Knoxville Empowerment Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15811)|
| 4:23:35| We've had nonprofits working with affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15815)|
| 4:23:40| We've had entrepreneurship centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15820)|
| 4:23:42| We've had lots of different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15822)|
| 4:23:46| The money part is scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15826)|
| 4:23:49| And the logistics of how it gets worked out are not going to be decided tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15829)|
| 4:23:58| But what gives me hope is a task force that can coordinate all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15838)|
| 4:24:09| For me, you know, and I've reflected about this a lot, and it's not about the money as much as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15849)|
| 4:24:17| Is there a group somewhere that can help bring to a collective table all the programs that are going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15857)|
| 4:24:28| We talk so much about, is it more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15868)|
| 4:24:32| Maybe it's not even as much more money as it is coordination and collaboration to know what all is actually being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15872)|
| 4:24:42| Duplication of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15882)|
| 4:24:44| So this is not going to be, you know, I can't even speak to it articulately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15884)|
| 4:24:51| It's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15891)|
| 4:24:54| I think the gist of it is, and the reason I was asking about the task force is because I think that's where the rubber meets the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15894)|
| 4:25:03| Dollars won't be the only solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15903)|
| 4:25:07| If it were the only solution, dollars have been thrown at things for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15907)|
| 4:25:13| I think collaboration and figuring out a prioritization of what holistically works is a good practice for everything that we try to deal with across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15913)|
| 4:25:29| And it's not government that's going to fix this by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15929)|
| 4:25:33| It's going to be our nonprofit partners, the faith community, everybody that works on uplifting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15933)|
| 4:25:43| So is this resolution everything that all of us want it to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15943)|
| 4:25:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15949)|
| 4:25:52| But I don't know what else we do but start here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15952)|
| 4:25:56| So I will support this resolution with many misgivings and questions and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15956)|
| 4:26:05| But I'm going to have faith that people of good faith will come to the table and look for solutions rather than to continue to blame, vilify, and point fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15965)|
| 4:26:22| It is time to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15982)|
| 4:26:25| So I will support this resolution, Vice Mayor McKenzie, and look forward to trying to help you continue work that I've been doing for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15985)|
| 4:26:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15997)|
| 4:26:39| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=15999)|
| 4:26:42| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16002)|
| 4:26:44| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16004)|
| 4:26:46| I just wanted to briefly, I know we're all really exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16006)|
| 4:26:51| I wanted to thank Vice Mayor McKenzie for initiating and giving us a start to pivot and really try and change things that people have been trying to change for a long time and frustratingly have not been able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16011)|
| 4:27:10| So I feel like it's a hard pivot to try and make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16030)|
| 4:27:16| I also think that we should challenge some of our governing partners because I feel like partnerships with them, and I think I'm touching on what other people have said here, is what's going to determine success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16036)|
| 4:27:29| You know, and I think about education disparities, which have been studied six ways of Sunday and haven't, you know, we're going to have to challenge them to partner with us in that hard pivot, not just in reiterating, you know, what's already been looked at and determined is a disparity, but actually addressing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16049)|
| 4:27:52| It's a holistic thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16072)|
| 4:27:54| And I just, I don't want people to be disappointed that people really want to make a change and get somewhere and move the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16074)|
| 4:28:04| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16084)|
| 4:28:06| I also want to say thank you to all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16086)|
| 4:28:08| And I know some of them had other comments that they didn't get to make state, I guess, because maybe the time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16088)|
| 4:28:18| So obviously, they know they can email us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16098)|
| 4:28:21| I know my colleagues probably have the same sentiments or the same comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16101)|
| 4:28:25| I've gotten lots of phone calls and emails, and certainly not been able to respond to them all over the past few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16105)|
| 4:28:31| So appreciate all the feedback from the community on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16111)|
| 4:28:39| Thank you, Council Member Rodgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16119)|
| 4:28:41| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16121)|
| 4:28:43| I just want to add two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16123)|
| 4:28:45| This is a really important challenge for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16125)|
| 4:28:49| To some of my colleagues' points, this is not a new challenge, but it is one that we should continue to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16129)|
| 4:28:57| It's a worthy endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16137)|
| 4:28:59| And it could be that we're making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16139)|
| 4:29:03| It's just going to take time to see the needle move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16143)|
| 4:29:05| So I like to think that, well, it's just the reality that it took decades to create this problem, maybe centuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16145)|
| 4:29:15| It may be a couple more decades before we see the needle move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16155)|
| 4:29:19| But the seeds we plant now won't bloom until then, and we have to continue to pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16159)|
| 4:29:25| So I'll be supporting the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16165)|
| 4:29:29| If nothing, to pursue this with good intent, to be optimistic, to do what we're trying to do, the hard things that we're asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16169)|
| 4:29:39| So this is a hard thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16179)|
| 4:29:41| This is probably the hardest thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16181)|
| 4:29:43| So I think it's worth the continued pursuit of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16183)|
| 4:29:47| I'll also add a second thing is this is the exact type of big dilemma that we need to talk about as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16187)|
| 4:29:55| And so I would encourage my colleagues to move heaven and earth so we can have a retreat in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16195)|
| 4:30:03| If we need to do it virtually, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16203)|
| 4:30:05| But this is among many hard, complicated topics that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16205)|
| 4:30:11| And I think we need to find time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16211)|
| 4:30:15| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16215)|
| 4:30:19| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16219)|
| 4:30:21| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16221)|
| 4:30:31| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16231)|
| 4:30:33| As Council Member Ryder was saying, there have been a lot of phone calls, a lot of e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16233)|
| 4:30:37| Not everybody in agreement with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16237)|
| 4:30:43| So I wanted to comment on that, that I think we're all aware that there's a lot of suffering and injustice all around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16243)|
| 4:30:53| There's been genocide and mass removal of Native people from their lands, the land that we're standing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16253)|
| 4:30:59| Knoxville City has 25% poverty rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16259)|
| 4:31:03| But for those who are feeling that this is divisive, I want to say it's not a context about whose suffering is greater or more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16263)|
| 4:31:15| I'm concerned about all of the poor and all of the working people that struggle and feel disregarded by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16275)|
| 4:31:25| And I think there's a lot of work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16285)|
| 4:31:29| But I'm supporting this resolution because this is a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16289)|
| 4:31:33| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16293)|
| 4:31:35| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16295)|
| 4:31:37| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16297)|
| 4:31:41| Council Member Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16301)|
| 4:31:45| I'll just say, I mean, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16305)|
| 4:31:47| I mean, I think we're all coming to this resolution from a whole lot of different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16307)|
| 4:31:55| You know, do I think there's a lot of good intent in coming to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16315)|
| 4:32:03| And I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16323)|
| 4:32:05| But here's what I'll say, is that I would never come to the table with $100 million of anything without a strategic plan and a roadmap about how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16325)|
| 4:32:15| I'm very open-minded about how to start to approach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16335)|
| 4:32:23| I have a great deal of concerns that nearly $50 million that has been committed to this district that doesn't hold what this resolution and other resolutions across the country have supported, be it minority business ownership, which we absolutely need to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16343)|
| 4:32:43| and incentivized homeownership and access to affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16363)|
| 4:32:49| I mean, we've invested a lot and continue to invest a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16369)|
| 4:32:53| And so, you know, obviously, as a resolution, this isn't anything, it's not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16373)|
| 4:33:01| And so to move forward with this, but I think there's going to be a great deal of deliberation and with this task force, a great deal of accountability on, you know, again, what's already been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16381)|
| 4:33:13| And then, you know, if the city is asked to ante up and for whatever amount, I mean, if the grant dollars aren't, you know, are we not able to secure them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16393)|
| 4:33:27| You know, does that mean tax increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16407)|
| 4:33:29| I mean, those are a lot of concerns on people's mind when they see, you know, $100 million put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16409)|
| 4:33:36| And so, you know, I'm just, I'm raising these concerns because I think, obviously, there's a lot greater dialogue that needs to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16416)|
| 4:33:47| And a road map on how we're going to get there and the accountability factors with this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16427)|
| 4:33:54| And I just, I really hope that, again, this coming to the administration with not a lot of notice, quite frankly, that there is a collaborative, a true collaborative effort with the administration to sit down and really determine how this is going to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16434)|
| 4:34:16| and how these dollars are going to be secured and allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16456)|
| 4:34:22| Thank you, Council Member Testerman. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16462)|
| 4:34:26| Thank you, Mayor. And I appreciate all of the comments because I know that they are heartfelt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16466)|
| 4:34:33| I also appreciate the concerns. And Council, I just want to implore each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16473)|
| 4:34:40| You've heard people speak to this resolution. I want you to make a decision about this resolution, not because of fear or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16480)|
| 4:34:51| But I want you to make a decision on this resolution based on what's in your heart and what you feel is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16491)|
| 4:34:59| It's interesting that a lot of times we don't, you know, we're OK with, you know, I mean, we're responsible for a whole lot of money in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16499)|
| 4:35:11| And we're not the only council that's ever done that. But it pains me sometimes when we're faced with challenges such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16511)|
| 4:35:20| We're saying that because the spirit in which this resolution is, is that we want to see the African-American community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16520)|
| 4:35:31| We want to leave it a lot better with this decision than what it has been before we came along, but also during our time here on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16531)|
| 4:35:41| And so that that's really what it's about. And again, I don't want to do not feel pressured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16541)|
| 4:35:48| I want you to vote your heart and what you think is right. I don't want anyone to make a decision today and then wish that you hadn't done it because no, none of us are forced to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16548)|
| 4:35:58| And so, again, I hope that you vote your conscience and more importantly, vote your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16558)|
| 4:36:03| I don't want to really continue to go down the path and talk about the about what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16563)|
| 4:36:10| But also, I want to say when people talk about what about poor white people or poor Hispanic people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16570)|
| 4:36:16| One of the things that I think that we all can can agree on is that anything that has historically been put in place to help poor black people, black people at all helps all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16576)|
| 4:36:28| Black people were not the ones that started holding up signs or putting signs in windows that said black only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16588)|
| 4:36:34| Those signs were put up by other people who black people we weren't welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16594)|
| 4:36:39| It was a time that we were not welcome. And so what you will find historically in the black community is that we are people who are collaborative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16599)|
| 4:36:48| We are people who want to see our people thrive and get a hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16608)|
| 4:36:53| This task force will be looking specifically at some of those disparities and gaps specific to the black community and some strategic solutions, because, yes, investment has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16613)|
| 4:37:04| And we still have not seen the type of improvement in these benchmarks that really should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16624)|
| 4:37:10| We should see based on some of that investment. So because this will be specific and I don't want to continue to beat this dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16630)|
| 4:37:18| But I just kind of hear some comments that I want to just say that, however, we vote on this resolution that, you know, please vote your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16638)|
| 4:37:31| If nothing else, just vote your heart. So thank you, Mayor. Are there any other questions that we have about about this? Are we ready to call for the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16651)|
| 4:37:43| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16663)|
| 4:37:48| I'll just I'll just say before we go to the vote, I'm very inspired by the members of the public who spoke to this and the members of council for having such a constructive discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16668)|
| 4:38:00| and I'll share a quote that inspires me that this discussion has made me think of because a lot of people have been working on these issues for many, many years, including some who spoke to us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16680)|
| 4:38:12| So it reminded me of this this quote from John F. Kennedy. All this will not be finished in the first in the next 100 days, nor will be nor will be finished in the first 1000 days, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16692)|
| 4:38:27| But let us begin. So let's begin with this council, with this city of Knoxville in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16707)|
| 4:38:34| So thank you, Vice Mayor, for helping lead this discussion and bringing us to the council. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16714)|
| 4:38:44| Seeing no further questions or comments. Mr. Johnson, would you conduct a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16724)|
| 4:38:51| Council Member McKenzie? Yes. Council Member Parker? Yes. Council Member Ryder? Yes. Council Member Roberto? Yes. Council Member Singh? Yes. Council Member Smith? Yes.

| 4:41:22| You all, this has been an effort the city has been working on for many years, and I'm excited that this furthers our commitment to our urban tree canopy, and also addresses some of the concerns and suggestions we've heard from the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16882)|
| 4:41:39| This is something that I just heard so much about, and I'm really excited that we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16899)|

| 4:42:14| The first one is Dale Madden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16934)|
| 4:42:16| Mr. Madden, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16936)|

| 4:42:22| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16942)|
| 4:42:23| Thank you for speaking with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16943)|
| 4:42:24| Oh, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16944)|
| 4:42:25| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16945)|
| 4:42:26| I appreciate the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16946)|
| 4:42:28| So I live in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16948)|
| 4:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16949)|
| 4:42:30| Name and address for the record, please, and then you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16950)|
| 4:42:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16953)|
| 4:42:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16954)|
| 4:42:35| My name is Dale Madden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16955)|
| 4:42:36| I live at 8400 Badgett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16956)|
| 4:42:38| I am presently chair of the City Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16958)|
| 4:42:41| Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight in favor of the addition of the Tree Mitigation Bank section to the Tree Protection Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16961)|
| 4:42:48| The City Tree Board has been discussing the need to modify the current Tree Protection Ordinance for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16968)|
| 4:42:55| The Tree Board was considering how to increase the city's ability to adequately protect the public benefits that trees provide to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16975)|
| 4:43:05| Although we have looked several times at issues that the current ordinance presents, we feel that the proposed Tree Mitigation Bank should move forward at this time, and we support its passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16985)|
| 4:43:18| This section will allow mitigation when a particular project cannot meet the present requirements for trees to be maintained on sites under the Tree Protection Ordinance and still develop the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=16998)|
| 4:43:33| Because of site conditions, restraints, the preservation of existing trees, or the planting of the required number of trees, this section will allow the applicant to move forward by providing funds to the city for replacement trees at another appropriate location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17013)|
| 4:43:49| In the past, a variance was allowed when compliance wasn't able to be accomplished on the site and the public benefits of trees did not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17029)|
| 4:43:59| The proposed change will now allow for a process to provide for the establishment of trees and thus provide for benefits of trees that would not have been planted in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17039)|
| 4:44:11| The City Tree Board had the opportunity to review and discuss the amendment that is before Council tonight on December 3, 2020, our last Tree Board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17051)|
| 4:44:23| We voted by a majority to support the recommended change. We would respectfully ask that the Board, that the City Council rather, vote to adopt the proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17063)|
| 4:44:33| Thank you. With that, I'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17073)|
| 4:44:38| Okay, thank you, Mr. Madden. We'll hear from one other speaker, but stay around if there are questions for you, if you could just stay on the call and be available for questions if they arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17078)|
| 4:44:50| The next person signed up to speak to this is Ms. Joyce Feld. Ms. Feld, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17090)|
| 4:44:54| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17094)|
| 4:44:56| Ms. Feld, I'll start by stating your name and address for the record. You'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17096)|
| 4:45:00| Thank you. My name is Joyce Feld. I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17100)|
| 4:45:08| And I am here speaking to you this evening as President of Scenic Knoxville and as a member of the Board of Directors of Trees Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17108)|
| 4:45:17| And I want to start by thanking some key people and organizations who played pivotal roles in bringing this amendment before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17117)|
| 4:45:25| First, I want to thank Enthusiastic Supporters Councilmember Tommy Smith and our Urban Forester, Casey Krause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17125)|
| 4:45:33| And the organizations that played major roles in getting us here are Scenic Knoxville, Trees Knoxville, the City Tree Board, the Sierra Club, and the local chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17133)|
| 4:45:46| And this amendment has also been endorsed by numerous community organizations and neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17146)|
| 4:45:53| I think we all agree on the numerous environmental, economic, and aesthetic benefits that trees bring to our urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17153)|
| 4:46:00| Knoxville has demonstrated its commitment to caring for and enhancing our urban tree canopy on public land by becoming a Tree City USA 28 years ago and by supporting a dedicated tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17160)|
| 4:46:14| The City took a quantum leap forward in this commitment when, in her first term, Mayor O'Hara created a position for Knoxville's first urban forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17174)|
| 4:46:25| Five years ago, a concerned group of citizens formed Trees Knoxville, whose mission is to preserve and grow Knoxville's public and private urban forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17185)|
| 4:46:36| The City took another important step forward in 2017 when extensive landscaping requirements were included in the new parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17196)|
| 4:46:45| These requirements were further expanded during the recode process, and for the first time, Knoxville's zoning ordinance includes a standalone landscaping article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17205)|
| 4:46:55| I find these developments very exciting, and I hope you do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17215)|
| 4:46:59| And I was glad to hear Mayor Kincannon say she was excited by this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17219)|
| 4:47:06| Nonetheless, there are times when a developer or property owner legitimately can't meet some or all of the landscaping requirements due to site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17226)|
| 4:47:15| And presently, when this happens, the developer or property owner is absolved of the responsibility of meeting these requirements and the costs associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17235)|
| 4:47:24| In these circumstances, the City loses the benefits that this landscaping would provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17244)|
| 4:47:29| The inclusion of a tree mitigation bank in our tree protection ordinance would correct this problem by allowing our urban forester to plant equivalent trees on public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17249)|
| 4:47:40| In addition, a tree bank will level the playing field so all developers and property owners are responsible for landscaping expenses to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17260)|
| 4:47:51| By adopting this amendment, Knoxville will join many other environmentally conscious and forward-thinking cities that include a tree bank in their ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17271)|
| 4:48:01| So on behalf of Scenic Knoxville and Trees Knoxville, we respectfully request that you approve this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17281)|
| 4:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17289)|
| 4:48:10| Thank you, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17290)|
| 4:48:12| Council, that concludes the speakers on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17292)|
| 4:48:15| Are there any questions or discussion from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17295)|
| 4:48:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17299)|
| 4:48:22| Oh, Council Member Rodgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17302)|
| 4:48:24| Just really quickly, I just want to say this is exciting and well overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17304)|
| 4:48:28| There's been a time in the past where developers, people trying to get their permits were like, where's the tree bank that I can contribute to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17308)|
| 4:48:35| If you have a zero lot line building, there's no place to put your tree and it holds up getting your permits and it ends up to be delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17315)|
| 4:48:45| So there's some other things in the code that I know staff is looking at for future things that might require bank contributions similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17325)|
| 4:48:53| So I'm glad we're taking this first step and we're there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17333)|
| 4:48:58| Thank you, Council Member Rodgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201215?start=17338)|
