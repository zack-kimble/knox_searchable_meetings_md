| 0:01:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| All right, well, now we're going to get started with our review of a proposed missing middle housing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| and I want to welcome Mayor Kincannon, who's going to give us some introductory remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| Welcome, Mayor. Glad to have you joining us, and we're looking forward to this proposal and your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| Okay, thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| I appreciate you all holding this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| It's a very important topic, and I appreciate all the time and attention you're devoting to it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| and that you've devoted to it for the last three and a half years plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| Knoxville is in a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| More people are moving to our city than ever before, and people born and raised here want to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=130)|
| 0:02:17| This mismatch between the need for housing and the available supply of housing has created a lot of hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| Addressing this crisis has been a huge priority since I took office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| and will continue to be a top priority in my second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| We need to augment our existing housing strategies, and we need to adopt new solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| Tonight, we are sharing a new solution, middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| The housing crisis requires some immediate Band-Aids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| We need to help people who are struggling to pay their rent and who are at risk of being evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| We also need long-term cures, effective ways to increase the amount and types of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| throughout the city and at all price points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| This Council has helped shape and support many strategies to address the housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| including, and this graphic up above is some of the stuff that you've been supporting and helping to shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| the redevelopment of blighted property, improving development services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| overhauling our zoning ordinance to encourage mixed use along the corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| tax incentives for affordable housing, KCDC projects, energy efficiency programs, and improvements to CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=199)|
| 0:03:27| Helping, you'll see, middle housing is just one small piece of this puzzle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| and it's currently, if we had a video animation, it's currently missing in much of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| So I just wanted to illustrate that this is just one part of a bigger housing strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| As you all know, helping our most vulnerable neighbors is essential to the health of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| I'm so proud of our commitment to a minimum of $50 million in local funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| towards the creation of more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| I'm also proud of our efforts to develop permanent supportive housing at Caswell Manor, Liberty Place, and Callahan Flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| We look forward to updating Council on our comprehensive housing strategy at a future workshop in the coming months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| and I'm working with Vice Member Berto to plan that as you guys address other topics in upcoming workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| But tonight is about middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| Let me set the stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| At any given time of your life, you may need or prefer different types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| You may be single, married, divorced, widowed, with kids, empty nesters, wanting a yard, not wanting a yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=270)|
| 0:04:40| You may be struggling to make ends meet, or you may be making six figures and doing just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| Maybe your parents move in with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| A three-level house may be perfect when you're 35, but not so good when you're 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| So 100 years ago, it was easy for people to build a variety of housing types to accommodate these different needs and preferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| Townhomes, duplexes, fourplexes, sixplexes, and single-family detached homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| Neighborhoods had a diversity of housing sizes and types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| After World War II, across the country and in Knoxville, land use rules were changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| Cars were available to the masses, and spreading things out, segregating land uses, was seen as the remedy for society's ills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=318)|
| 0:05:27| By the 1960s, only two types of housing remained easy to build, single-family detached homes and large multifamily apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=327)|
| 0:05:36| And this is what most of Knoxville's housing stock consists of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| Now let me be clear, there's nothing wrong with single-family detached homes, and there's nothing wrong with large apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| But we have realized that spreading things out has considerable downsides for our health, for the cost of infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| for our ability to age in place, and for our ability to meet the demand for diverse types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=354)|
| 0:06:02| So missing middle is really a case of what is old is new again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| Our missing middle housing proposal is a path to creating more sustainable, walkable, equitable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| Our middle housing proposal does not mandate that anyone build a particular type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| It merely makes it legal for middle housing to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| It gives property owners more options while still protecting what makes our neighborhoods special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| Our middle housing proposal will also increase our housing supply, a crucial remedy to our housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| I want to thank all the city staff who have worked so hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| You're going to be hearing from all of them later this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| I also want to thank all the members of the public who participated in the stakeholder meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| and the community open houses to share their concerns and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| And now to get into the nitty-gritty details, I'm going to turn it over to our lead on this effort, the one and only Cheryl Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| Thank you, Cheryl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Thank you, Mayor. We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| And we'll turn it over to Chief Policy Officer Cheryl Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Good evening. Thank you all for having us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| I want to start our evening by recognizing a few key players in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| First of all is Aaron Gill, who presented to this body March 30th when we had a visitor from OptiCoast Design in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=438)|
| 0:07:29| and really has championed getting this movement going to make sure that we could answer your call related to that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=449)|
| 0:07:40| But the team, we've had eight different departments really work on this in various and sundry forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| but the core team of individuals are Brian Berry, who is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=468)|
| 0:07:57| Not here, but he's going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| He's the Deputy Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Christina McGrawns, who is the Staff Attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| Amy Brooks, who is the Executive Director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| And Lindsey Crockett, who is the Principal Planner and Design Review Program Manager with Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| And this team has had a heavy lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| They've done an incredible job, and they deserve lots of kudos for putting together a really strong plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=501)|
| 0:08:29| I also want to thank Carter Hall and Kevin DeBose for their support of this initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| and Carter is running point on the PowerPoint tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| So thanks so much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| So Missing Middle Housing are house-scale buildings in walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| It's neighborhood complementing housing with simple, well-designed options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| between the scales of single-family homes and mid-rise or high-rise apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| Missing Middle Housing is about creating a diversity of housing options for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| So why is it missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Over the last 75 years, zoning has sort of pushed housing into single-family, residential, and mid- and high-rise apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=554)|
| 0:09:27| We have across the country started to see more townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| but there's no single thing that caused this to be missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| It's not exclusively zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| There were a whole host of things, but we stopped building this type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=578)|
| 0:09:45| But we used to do it really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| You could even order it from a Sears catalog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| It's important that we note you probably recognize at least one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| as something that you could very easily see here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Here's a couple of additional examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| I think most of you have seen plenty of examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| So why middle housing in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| This is about increasing housing options at a variety of sizes and price points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| Of course, we want to expand the housing stock overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| and eliminate barriers to the development of missing middle housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| When we think about our demographics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| we recently received some updated information from the American Community Survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| indicating 40.8% of Knoxville households are single persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| and 80.1% of households do not have children under the age of 18 living in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=640)|
| 0:10:49| Across the nation, those under the age of 35 and over the age of 55| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| are most aggressively seeking middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| As our demographics shift, the types of housing available also needs to shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| We need housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Making it easier to build missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| is one of many ways to address housing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| So how did we get to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| Opticos Design did a scan of Knoxville they completed in the fall of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| This body held a workshop, as I mentioned earlier, with Opticos Design on March 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| and then city staff also presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| As a part of that conversation, we asked you very directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| let's talk about this, how much do you want from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| Do you want us to pursue and move forward with plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| And we got, not only during the meeting, but after the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| quite a resounding yes, we want you to move forward with plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| So that's how we got here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| So city and planning staff have been working diligently on a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=719)|
| 0:12:08| The missing middle scan specifically identified zoning code barriers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| the areas of town best suited for middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| and recommendations to help Knoxville specifically diversify housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| The best opportunities for middle housing are walkable, bikeable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| served by neighborhood, servicing businesses close to transit routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| and potentially close to existing multifamily or middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| Much of the neighborhoods that we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| have these examples of middle housing in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| mostly from well into the previous century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=772)|
| 0:13:00| I'm going to turn it over to Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=780)|
| 0:13:09| There we go. Thank you, Cheryl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Okay, so now we're going to, so as Cheryl just touched on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| missing middle housing types are most successful when they are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| in an existing walkable or newly built walkable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| So by walkable, we mean something to walk to besides more houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| And so for the purposes of the work completed for the missing middle housing scan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| walkable describes places where a person can walk or bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| to fulfill some or all daily needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| These environments accommodate vehicles but might not require one for every trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| And so this map illustrates current residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| within a walkable environment and was produced as part of that scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| And the map illustrates the walkable centers that are either ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| for missing middle housing or appropriate for missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| and are either a five or ten minute walking or biking distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| And areas that are ideal for this type of housing are small block links,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| a well-connected street network, and nearby services shops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| that can support a high degree of walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| And when we talk about missing middle housing ready or supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| a well-connected street network with a mix of block links| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| that provide a walkable foundation that will support missing middle housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| and enable pedestrian scale redevelopment to occur on adjacent commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| So for Knoxville, based on these definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| the most walkable neighborhoods are those located near downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| or around the historic core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| So as part of this analysis, the missing middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| it was recommended that Knoxville first focus on areas of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| that are ideal or appropriate for missing middle type housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| And these are neighborhoods that may have many walkable characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| in existing infrastructure that may be ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| but may also have certain elements that might still be missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| And like I mentioned, they may be in or near downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| And many of these areas, when we look at Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| are currently classified as traditional neighborhood residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| or what's referred to as TDR in the city's land use plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| The characteristics of TDR, as described on the slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| align with the characteristics that have been identified as ideal for middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| And those are small or smaller lots, sidewalks, alleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| narrow lots located on a grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| And this is just a map that illustrates, in yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| the areas that are currently classified as traditional neighborhood development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| or that TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| And we've shared those at the open houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Now we'll get into the proposed zoning ordinance amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| These are part of the materials that are in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| We have created a new section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| a proposed section in Article 4 called Residential Neighborhood Districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| that is specifically focused on the standards for middle housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| The standards can be applied in the R and 2, R and 3, and R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| and as I just mentioned, are located in that TDR land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| which aligns with our currently adopted land use plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| We have included a statement of intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| and developed a definition for middle housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| that will reside in the definition section, which is Article 2.3 of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| and that particular definition references this section if it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| So Article 4.6A provides definitions of each type of middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| and these descriptions include details on height, scale, design features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| and these may differ from the base zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| but they'll only apply to middle housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| We have proposed the addition of a new table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| developed specifically for middle housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| that identifies the type of housing by zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| and whether or not they are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| All proposals for permitted middle housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| will be reviewed by planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| and highlighted in yellow in this chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| are housing types that are currently permitted by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| in the base zone without special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| However, they're without the standards currently proposed before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| as part of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| So now I'm going to turn it over to Lindsay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| and she's going to walk you through the rest of the proposed code changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| Okay, so one of the recommendations from the missing middle housing scan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| was to allow all middle housing types by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| if clear standards are applied to control building height, footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| parking and parking location, building entry and frontage, and streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| So that's the framework for this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| for the dimensional and design standards that follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| The intent of these standards is to encourage house-scale buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| with a lower perceived density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| So they accommodate multiple units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| but their footprints are similar to single-family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| The heights are not taller than the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| The standards will regulate available housing type by lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| So currently housing forms are regulated by lot area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| within the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| The middle housing scan pointed out several issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| with regulating by lot area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| which I believe builders are quite familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Existing lots, in particular in these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| they don't always contain the minimum required amount of lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| So to accommodate a middle housing form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| say if you wanted to build a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| lots might need to be assembled with adjacent lots via purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| or parts of adjacent lots via subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| which is costly and time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| This also results in lots that are larger than existing lots in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| which can have an unpredictable result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| on the size and number of the buildings on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| So using the lot width to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| means that these housing types can fit on existing lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| and that maintains the existing pattern of the streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| while still accommodating additional housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| So there's the table on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| This is a new table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| It'll be Table 4.3 if approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| It establishes the dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| by which these types are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| and they supersede the dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| in Table 4.1 of the residential code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| So there are standards to regulate that minimum lot width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| with and without an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| That's acknowledging the possible need for a driveway access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| coming off the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Maximum building width and depth, setbacks, and height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| One note here I think is relevant to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| The building heights are measured in stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| So the scan noted that stories are a more effective way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| to ensure new buildings are compatible in scale with the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| In two of the three zoning districts that are affected here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| the maximum building height is 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| and three stories could technically fit within a 35-foot overall max,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| but a three-story building is likely out of scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| with the existing development pattern in these streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| There's a definition for story and half story in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| There are also definitions for building width and depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| so review of that building footprint is consistent across the types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| And then finally there are standards for dormer size and placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| That's related to that half story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| and that's aiming again just to keep things in scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| with the neighborhood context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| So the parking, one element from the middle housing scan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| it noted that current parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| are understandable for typical multifamily developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| that aren't in walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| However, for middle housing developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| a different approach is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| They also noted that there is not a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| for more than one on-site space per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Requiring more than one space per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| makes site design for these forms pretty challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| because the typical lot that could accommodate middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| in particular in these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| is the same size as most single-family lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| and only so much parking can physically fit with the building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| So that image on the right, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| is really representative of how much pavement occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| when there's a fourplex with two spaces per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| compared to one space per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| So where applicable, these parking standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| supersede the off-street parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Overall, the standards require one space per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| There are other elements, such as reduced landscape buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Parking areas for multifamily developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| typically require a 10- or 20-feet landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| and the standards here would reduce it to five with a fence or a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| There's location criteria for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| So parking is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| One goal of which is to ensure that the front yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| aren't taken up by parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Parking must be placed in the interior side or rear yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| accessed by an alley when operable alleys are present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| or accessed by a driveway that extends past that building facade line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| if no alley is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| And this is similar to the current code for the infill housing overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| and the infill housing design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| There are also some standards related to design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| for parking design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| prohibiting front-facing garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| and circular driveways in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| There are also design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| These are really just intended to guide the construction of new buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| that are similar in footprint, height, and placement to the context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| but allow for flexibility and generate visual interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| They're relatively simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| They're informed by the neighborhood context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| and then existing design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| that we've already been working with for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| like those for the infill housing overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| There is precedent for design standards in the code already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| The established neighborhood zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| the EN neighborhoods, new buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| and additions in this district already receive planning staff review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| for design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| So there are standards for roof lines, walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| There's a list of design elements from which applicants can choose three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Again, these are relatively simple elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| things that may be included anyways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| like a front porch or eave overhangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| And then there are standards for orientation to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| So townhouses are required to be oriented parallel to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| instead of perpendicular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Front elevations of these buildings need to face the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| with at least one ground-level entry to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| I think when people think negatively about a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| the example that comes to mind is often that 1980s front gable massing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| where the two entries face the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| and there are no windows looking at the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| So the intent here is to maintain that existing street-facing character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| of the neighborhood and not create situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| where buildings don't engage with the street at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| We also have standards for conversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| So one tactic to incentivize and support use of our existing housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| is standards that allow conversion of existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| to middle housing types via interior renovation or addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| So the available types would correspond to Table 4.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| That's the types that are permitted in the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| And then the dimensional standards table as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| There are relatively simple design standards here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Additions can't be made to the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| They must be made to the rear side elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Some additional height can be accommodated with dormers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| but really they just stress compatibility in height and scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| So it can be easier and quicker to build an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| It can be less expensive than demolishing a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| and building an entire new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| And it's definitely more sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| So it conserves that energy that's already embodied in the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| There's less construction waste going to the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| The historic preservationist saying is the greenest building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| is the one already built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| So allowing for conversions would allow us to work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| So the final element of the code here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| So per 46GB in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| no variances can be granted for the middle housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| So these are not intended to be heard by the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| However, there are instances where it might be practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| to allow for variation from certain standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| due to existing conditions on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| These would be approved administratively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| and the code is set up really specifically about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| It's lot width, corner side setbacks, and design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| So we've stated the amount which the lot width and setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| could be varied or decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| and then the standards by which they're evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| So that allows for some wiggle room based on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| but it's very specific in that framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| and it ensures that the other standards are being met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| if one element is being varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| So that's the end of the run-through of the code itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| I believe Cheryl's going to wrap up, and then we'll answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| So OptiCoast, when they were here back in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| we had the opportunity to spend some time with that team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| and they really strongly urged us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| but planning staff and city staff had the opportunity to meet with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| and they encouraged us to create a strong base that could be built upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| Based on their experience with cities across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| they also emphasized that missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| is not necessarily a good fit across all of every city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| and the cities that are the most successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| start with a smaller geographic area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| that has the infrastructure support that we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| with transit, walkable, bikeable, neighborhood servicing businesses, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| This team has put together what we believe is a really thoughtful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| detailed plan that covers all the best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| and marries those best practices with what is practical and reasonable for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| We believe this plan is sustainable and able to be implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| and look forward to hearing what your questions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Thank you very much. Appreciate the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| Council, this is our opportunity for council questions and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| We do have our new audio system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| so remember you've got to hit the talk button, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| and then you can also turn on your light and I can recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| I was going to start with kind of a big policy question for the presenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1662)|
| 0:27:53| In looking at the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| there's obviously opportunities for demolition of existing housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| but then there's also the conversion piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| and I can see why both of them would be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| My question was about the conversion piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| When we heard from OptiGhost before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| my understanding was that we were going to try to have more conversions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| than demolitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| and that we were going to try to keep whatever comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| in line with what was going on in the surrounding homes in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| If I remember correctly from that presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| there were a lot of different examples that we saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| where you could see driving by them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| and not knowing that it was a duplex or a triplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| because it looked like a single-family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| We had talked about maybe there being a catalog that you could pick from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| and I didn't notice the catalog in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| but basically, policy-wise, I just wanted to get a sense for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| are we encouraging more of the conversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| are we trying to encourage the demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| and are we trying to stay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| You're going to drive by and not notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| that this is anything different in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| I'm going to start, and then I'll pass it to anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| who has additional thoughts towards the end of the table down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| We really want to move forward with a pre-approved plan book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| that would provide plans that have been assessed by our internal teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| that we could give and provide to the various developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1773)|
| 0:29:40| that would be interested in developing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| The current plan for a plan book at this moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| would be focused predominantly on new construction across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| It's new construction that has happened most prevalently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| when it comes to middle housing and changes in zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| It's predominantly new construction on what was vacant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| that has been the overwhelming majority of what has come to fruition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| for middle housing across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| We want to do a plan book, but we kind of have to have this step first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| We have to have the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| We have to have the guardrails, the parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| under which we're going to support this type of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| in order to be able to do a plan book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| We would love to move forward with that in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| So I guess what I'm hearing from you then is that both are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| and they're both options, but it would tend to be more of a demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| because most of the time you're seeing changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| No, no demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| That is not what is happening across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| What's happening across the country is new construction on vacant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| where there was not previously a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| That's the overwhelming majority of middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| that is happening all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| That is the area in which our plan book would at least initially focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| Okay, so what you're saying is in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| when you look at places where this has happened before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| or where they've addressed missing middle before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| it is an empty space, it's a vacant lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| where you're seeing more of the new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| What are you noticing with regard to existing housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Is that being done mainly through conversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| or are they having to tear those down and build something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1896)|
| 0:31:46| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| I'm Brian Berry with the City's Plans Review and Inspections Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| The City currently works under the 2018 ICC codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| so any kind of conversion that was going to take place today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| would be required to meet either the 2018 IRC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| the International Residential Code, or the IBC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| depending upon the number of units that would go in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| And so to convert an existing single-family residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| or a duplex into additional units is going to require things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| such as fire separation, potentially sprinkler units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| So there's a level of cost that's going to go into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| for conversion of these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| that I think would have to be factored into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| And, of course, it's going to be site-specific, building-specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| as to whether or not even a conversion could take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| in order to meet the building code requirements for life safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| So it's somewhat speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| I'm not saying that it wouldn't take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| but I think it's uncertain exactly to the extent that it would be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| Well, Mr. Berry, the dimensional standards that we're looking at here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| are those in line with what you would typically see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| in a surrounding single-family home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| So in the proposal there are dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| And so my question is, if the goal is to basically have someone be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| to drive by and not know that they're seeing something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| than a single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| are the dimensional standards in line with that thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| if that is what the goal is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| So the dimensional standards currently in RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| for a single-family residence are a minimum 50-foot wide lot width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| which is kind of characteristic to what is in a lot of these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| that are shown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| So the lot widths shown in what was being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| are, I think, characteristic with what is within these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| So the dimensional standards are basically the same as what you would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| in a typical single-family neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2039)|
| 0:34:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| I'm going to turn it over to Councilmember Ryder, who I didn't rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| Okay, I guess I have to push the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| I don't know if I have to move this box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| This is very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| I've sat down with staff several times over the past couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| and talked about the evolution of planning and what was going into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| I think this is a very promising start at this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| What I would like to ask my colleagues and anybody in the audience to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| is to walk around, not just drive through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| but actually go walk through some of our neighborhoods like my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Our neighborhoods, the existing neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| were actually whole cities in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| So they contain all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| They weren't single-family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| They were whole towns, and they had all the types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| And there's no emphasis on, as you're walking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| oh, that's not a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| It's just something different that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| What is different is at the time that many of these structures were built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| pre-World War II, there was an emphasis on certain roof pitches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| Things were more in sync with the windows and the dimensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| So when you walk around, those are the things that you're going to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| You're not going to see tiny windows and a large wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| because the windows were the air conditioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| There's a certain rhythm and flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| and that is what I like about what's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| I feel that's what you were asking about, Vice Mayor Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| is will they stand out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| And when you're going up and down these streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| like when I go down Morgan or I go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| I can't remember the name of the street next to Cabrew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I think there's one or two down that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| they don't tend to stand out because of the roof pitch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| the height, the dimensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| These are things that we've achieved with infill housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| in the historic districts with the H1 overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| and this is like a light version of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| where it kind of says this will meet the flow of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| and things will not look out of sync because they will fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| We have many empty lots in some of these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| and this is just an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Someone could build infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| I know of one example in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| somebody built a couple of different lots recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| and they built a large single-family home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| because that's what they chose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| It was their land and they chose to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| I did get, switching gears a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I did get some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| and I'm hearing you talking about demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| When I listen to the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| I'm not hearing a focus on demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| I'm hearing a focus on these are design guidelines and standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| for how you would fill in empty lots in our existing thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| because the economics of demolition don't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| A house around the corner for me just sold for $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| It is a shell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| It's gutted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| It's in terrible condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| It doesn't have a clear title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| which is why it was never on the market before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| and it's a 37-foot wide lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| So it economically doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| You can tear it down and you can build something slightly bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| but the size of the lot will really constrain what you can do on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| and when you make the standards in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| where it has to be average of block face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| all of the houses on that street are in sync with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| All of the houses on that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| they were working class historic houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| which, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| I want to point out we've lost a lot of those houses in our area historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| because, remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| we were a whole city before North Knoxville because some of them were built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| in the lower flood plain lands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| like around First Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Many of those were taken eminent domain because they flooded every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| and the federal government was coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| and it cost the government a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| And so they gave people fair market value and those houses were lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| So we lost a lot of the working class housing historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| but we still have the other houses that were higher up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| And I'm going to run out of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| so I'm going to come back and ask more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| because I have some questions about the conversion part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| and what you can do now under the code as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| So I don't think the economics support demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| My house is now worth three times as much as it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| because of the economics that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| 30-year-old Lauren could not buy that house again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| and that's part of the issue that we have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| is I have all these friends that are in their 20s and 30s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| and there's nothing for them to buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| and much less could it make economic sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| to demolish something that they spent $100,000 on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| Thank you. Council Member Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| I have several questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| but I kind of want to concur with a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| that I definitely feel like this is a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| But as we have heard for quite some time now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| we are definitely in a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| And the only way we're going to see our way out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| is to get creative and build more housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| to some type of scale or volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| And with that, then stabilizes rents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| given the high percentage of city residents that are renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| So in order to meet the demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| then that starts to fix itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| and address these exorbitant increases in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| So I do, you know, the Opticos proposal did address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2438)|
| 0:40:46| you know, across the entire city and walkable areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| but the administration's proposal is a much smaller focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| And again, if we're trying to address this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| with any type of volume, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| I'm just curious why it was reeled back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| and has put a much smaller geographic area on this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2470)|
| 0:41:19| I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| I may pass this off also to Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| But, you know, the scan was for Knoxville, the entire city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| but the recommendation to us directly was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| don't necessarily start with all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| Create a sustainable base that you can build off of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| that you can implement, that you could grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| if there's the desire from the community to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| And as we started looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| I'm going to let Ms. Brooks talk about geography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| the TDR geography is what we had in existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| that looked like it really lined up the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| from an infrastructure standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| And so as we were analyzing the different options that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| that was the one that we felt lined up best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Do you want to expand on that, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| Sure, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| As I noted in our presentation, I showed the map from the scan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| that identified some larger areas in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| But, again, it's not the entirety of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| There are other areas that were identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| as potentially missing middle housing ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| But, again, Opticos did state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| and this is directly from their report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| that it's really important to apply these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| and prioritize these and fit these into certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| So kind of testing it out, as Cheryl just alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| And I do think it's really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| the Laney's classification that was selected for this, the TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| these changes in zoning align with already approved plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| And I think that's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| when you're looking at making proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| to update the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| that you do look back to your approved plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| And these are areas that have already been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| that meet the criteria for missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Okay, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| I go back to this playbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| as supposedly being designed for new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| And I do agree that conversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| is largely cost prohibitive in so many circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| but we're also starved for land in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| And so going back to putting such a tight perimeter around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| you know, it's baby steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| when we're dealing with a gigantic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| And so I would just encourage that we have a playbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| not just for new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| but conversion for those that can make the numbers work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| and it be economically feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| So quickly, I'm curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| how were the lot widths determined in the TDR areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2657)|
| 0:44:26| And was it just, well, just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| is it based on like an average lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| and kind of determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| what those modifications needed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| So we based the minimum lot widths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| with alley and without alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| on A, the existing conditions in these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| B, the footprints that can accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| these middle housing forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| But also we based these dimensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| including the lot width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| but also the building width and depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| on data that OptiCoast provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| They have a whole type book of these idealized forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| and how big a lot width needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| to accommodate a duplex, triplex, quadplex, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| And they, you know, as the professionals in this movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| have implemented many municipal codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| and seen it work, seen what works and what doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| So we based that on those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| All right, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| So I have a series of questions, but to kick it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| I want to thank, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| thank you for outlining all the puzzle pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| I think it's really important for the public to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| this alone isn't trying to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| every bit of housing crisis we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| So there's bodies voted on many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| and supported many aspects of that puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| So thank you for illustrating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| I also want to compliment staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| I think this, from a policy standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| makes a ton of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| I think you all did a great job of the standards and the scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| and all the technical aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| I can see also sentiments that residents have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| that they can't necessarily articulate in a technical way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| kind of built into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| So I applaud the analysis that's gone into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| on top of the Opticos recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| I want to make sure that we fully articulate those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| for the everyday quality of life for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So I have a couple kind of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| related to the TDR area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| I think it's a good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| I think it's the right starting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| the right classification to spring from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| Just some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| I know the South Waterfront form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| provides a preview of what traditional neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| can expect from this type of proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| So I encourage, my colleagues are very familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| but I encourage everybody to analyze the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| particularly the SW1 area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| because it includes this type of housing already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| And so if you want to see the pros and cons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| and the tradeoffs of what this will look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| I encourage you to go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| because there's been new construction and conversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| particularly on the east side of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| I think conversion is the biggest concern I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| When I stand back and look at all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| is that when I just ask general residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| even of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| who are not included in this first phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| which we'll discuss in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| what I hear is people are more okay with infill and empty lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| than demolition and conversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| So do with that what you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| There's a lot to unpack there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| but I just think if I nail down the salient points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| that I've heard from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| their concern is demolition and replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| So I think some of these pieces in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| that are meant to act as guardrails for that are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| I think there are others that we could potentially add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| But I'll get off a stump for a second and ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| The current TDR designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| if that were to ever expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| that would come back before Planning Commission and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| There's two different ways that that could come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| An individual property owner can request a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| and a change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| You all review those quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| Or if a larger area, a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| a part of the community would like to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| that land use classification, you could go through a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| and that would go before Planning Commission and this body as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| So in other words, a neighborhood could opt in to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| Is there an official process for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| What does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| How does an entire neighborhood vote on that or apply for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| It might be similar to the EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| There is a process for neighborhoods to pursue an EN designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| You could think of it as a sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| You could go through that potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| You wouldn't necessarily have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| This body could direct staff to pursue that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| It could come a number of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| It just depends on the size of the geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| I definitely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| I like that you mentioned the sector plan and what role that plays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| and that drives this as opposed to ad hoc rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| I definitely think I prefer that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Hopefully all planners would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| But do you think it's important to specify the path of that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| And it's okay if we haven't figured it out yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| but it sounds like there are multiple options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Should we direct explicitly a certain path for neighborhoods to go about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| If they're wanting to pursue a large-scale land use classification change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| And staff would be happy to give some different proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| of what that could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| Well, just given that the first district includes South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| and South Knoxville is not technically included in this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| I think that will be a question I've already received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| and will continue to receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| I think I want to nail down that process as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| So I'll pause and come back to Page 2 later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| So I have a few different questions about the difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| what Opticos recommended versus those things that we're choosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| to take out of that report and apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| One would be Opticos, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| recommended us getting rid of sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| working towards that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3071)|
| 0:51:19| You can get back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Another point was TDR is our criteria that we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3082)|
| 0:51:32| What Opticos suggested was all walkable areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Why did we choose TDRs and not all walkable areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3096)|
| 0:51:44| Another question on that is we keep saying that we are testing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| out in small pieces when Opticos has gone into quite a few cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| Even Memphis started this in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| So there's a lot of evidence already out there about what is working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| We can learn from what others have done instead of us being so fearful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| in moving forward, especially when there's such a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| So with the TDR geography, the scan shows and the map that we showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| earlier shows a broader cross-section of Knoxville as walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| communities that could be appropriate for middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| You're accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| In our conversations with Mr. Perez and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| they encouraged us to think about implementing this in a smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| geographic area to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| As we identified what were the geographic areas we had that best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| matched with this, the TDR is the one that we felt like aligned the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| Does that answer that portion of your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Just one more point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| We've continued to consult with Mr. Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| and I even had a call with him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| And he is very much completely in support of this plan and thinks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| taking this particular geography as a starting point is an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| step, especially given the geography that it covers and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| infrastructure support that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| Another, switching a little bit, the areas that we've identified for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| this, what percentage of the city is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| Yeah, we have some data related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| One moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| While you guys are looking, and have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| if we were to, best case scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| maximize all of the space that is available in these identified areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| how many units could we maximum reach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| What could we get out of this small piece that we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| I don't think there's a way to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| I mean, it depends on which type of middle housing is put where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| I just don't know that there's any way that we could even fathom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| Best case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| I have no capacity to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| I don't want to speak for everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| We can provide you with some statistics here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| So there are a little over 62,000 residentially zoned properties citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| A little over 25% of those are zoned citywide or located in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| Within the TDR, we have vacant properties within the TDR land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3289)|
| 0:54:59| And this is just looking at the ones that we're talking about for this particular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| So that's R and 1, 2, 3, and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| There's 2,039 vacant currently in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| And then, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| We've done some preliminary analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| So within the TDR, 78.8% of the vacant properties can accommodate a new missing middle housing type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| And this is based on that lot frontage that's been identified in the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| A little over 1,000 of those properties can accommodate a duplex or triplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| 123 properties could currently accommodate a fourplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| And at least 113 properties could fit a multiplex, as currently proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| My last concern, then my time's up, is when I look at what we've designated and I look at redlining maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3346)|
| 0:55:54| they're quite similar, and that is a very large concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| Oh, Fugett was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Council Member Fugett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Some of my questions just got answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Thank you, Councilwoman Singh, because I wanted to know about the number of infill lots and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| My next question, and I apologize if I don't have this memorized, but I imagine a lot of people watching don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3378)|
| 0:56:26| So how often are sector plans looked at, and are they on a regular review cycle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3386)|
| 0:56:36| Because I think people will be interested in that if that's part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| They're not currently on a regular cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| I think best practice is to update them every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| Five to ten years is historically a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| This community has pursued that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| I assume a large part of that has to do with staff capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| Staff capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| The update to the city zoning code took a lot of staff time, both city and planning, and then obviously pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3424)|
| 0:57:12| But just in general, I imagine they're rather staff intensive to do sector plans, and that takes quite a bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| And that's sort of in complement to Councilman Smith's question, if a neighborhood wants to do it and it's part of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| So I'll leave that alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| You answered that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| The only thing I will say about this is I think it's important for us to remember that this is another tool in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3452)|
| 0:57:44| I think we as a city have got to realize there's no magic thing that's going to fix all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3464)|
| 0:57:54| And this is a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| The way we're going to get the most housing quickly is large, multifamily apartments like we've been building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3479)|
| 0:58:11| That's how you get maximum capacity sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| We've talked about this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| I know the city's working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| The zoning allows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| We've got to figure out new tools to incentivize mixed-use development along our corridors where the infrastructure is already in place to do more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3500)|
| 0:58:35| That's the fastest way to get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| And so to me, these are not either-ors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| These are both ands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| And I think we are capable of walking and chewing gum at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| And so I would like for us to understand and for the community to understand that not everything fits everywhere appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3526)|
| 0:58:57| So I like where this is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| I do think it is a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| There are other opportunities to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| But I gathered when we had our workshop in March, one of the conversations about a pilot was A, for people to get familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3545)|
| 0:59:20| because the last thing we want is people to kill it before it ever starts because they are so concerned about what happens that as it goes to change a community, people just shut it down before it starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3560)|
| 0:59:38| And the last thing I'll say, maybe, along Councilman Smith's thing, what I hear is people just want stuff that looks like it belongs in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3578)|
| 0:59:53| If it's a conversion and it looks like everything else and it belongs and it's the right scale and the materials look the same and it keeps the character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3593)|
| 1:00:05| people are very concerned that the character of the neighborhood from the way it looks, feels, and walks changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3605)|
| 1:00:15| So I like a lot of what you're planning because that keeps that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| So I got all my questions answered, so I just talked. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| And Councilwoman Singh, I think, said it best, unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| And that's what I've been challenged with here recently from people across my district with some concerns as it relates to, you know, when the floodgates are open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3638)|
| 1:00:50| how do we regulate one community or one district not necessarily getting flooded and oversaturated with duplexes and townhomes and all of the things that go into the missing middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3650)|
| 1:01:03| And I'm not certain if we have a mechanism to be able to regulate that once it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| And then housing that is, you know, once the housing is there, you know, will the rental costs really be such that people can afford necessarily to stay there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3670)|
| 1:01:23| Affordability, I think, just depends on a person's financial situation and so that's a question I've been tasked with recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3683)|
| 1:01:31| And then also when we talk about a lot of times those properties that are vacant or blighted and we look at where those are located, I can definitely understand those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3691)|
| 1:01:49| But also when we talk about doing this thing in a pilot perhaps just to see how this integrates into a community because when we're talking about single family homes and now we're putting, you know, duplexes and multiplexes a door or two down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3709)|
| 1:02:10| there are people, I think, who are now starting to giving some people some pause in these neighborhoods that are going to be potentially impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3730)|
| 1:02:18| And so how do we ensure that there's not an oversaturation just because those lots or those properties are available in a particular area or neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3738)|
| 1:02:30| I, so far what we have been able to glean from our Opticos friends is that this really is only happening in an incremental way across the country in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3750)|
| 1:02:45| We're not seeing floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| I don't know that we have specific, when it comes to people's ability to do things with their own property, I'm not sure that we have a whole lot of restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3768)|
| 1:02:58| What we do have, though, is we have design standards to help make sure that it adheres to the existing character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3778)|
| 1:03:20| We have dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| You know, we have these, we've put these guidelines in place to make sure there are at least guardrails for how this construction would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3802)|
| 1:03:32| Does anyone else have, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| No, I would just say that I'm not aware of any tools that we currently have at our disposal to limit, you know, like put a cap on the number of duplexes that you can have in a certain area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3816)|
| 1:03:50| And I think that that's some of the concern that I've been hearing recently, is that if there's a street that has multiple vacant lots or blighted property that could, you know, once it's zoned, then absolutely we have no control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3830)|
| 1:04:05| And so, and we can have additional conversation as it relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| But I do think that it's important maybe just to take a tour of some of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| I know that we looked at that briefly a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| But I think take a deeper dive and I think that's incumbent on me since I'm being challenged with this from people in my district as it relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3861)|
| 1:04:29| So, but again, I think we just, as you said, potential unintended consequences that once it's approved, we cannot regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3869)|
| 1:04:40| So, I do think something to think about, but we'll meet about that and maybe take some tours and look a little bit more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3880)|
| 1:04:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| I was hoping we could spend a little bit more time on the process for approving new projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3901)|
| 1:05:16| I know that the proposal is for this to be by right and that planning staff would work with any individual looking to develop or convert into middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3916)|
| 1:05:39| Is there an appeal process that's possible or can you tell us also more about that approval process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3939)|
| 1:05:48| Certainly, I can start and then I'm probably going to ask Lindsay to walk you through how we do a couple of different approvals because I think this one might be similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| Again, if this was approved, we'd want to flesh that out further with plans for your inspection on how those would come to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| But any decision of a planning staff member is appealable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| It's appealable to planning commission and then obviously their decisions are appealable to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| We currently review projects in the established neighborhood district, the Ian district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| That's staff level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| We also do level one reviews, a certificate of appropriateness and our overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| Those are staff level and I can let Lindsay walk you through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| As Amy said, based on the zoning district or the overlay, we have different standardized processes for the planning staff review for each of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=3995)|
| 1:06:45| We don't have a full implementation plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| For example, if someone is going through the administrative review process in a historic district, we have a basic application form and a checklist for supporting documentation that we make available on our website, in our office, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4009)|
| 1:07:04| so that an applicant knows in advance what they'll be expected to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| People don't always start with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| Sometimes people start with their permit because they don't necessarily know they're in a zoning overlay or a zoning district that requires planning review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4032)|
| 1:07:20| That's pretty normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| We work with them in that way, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| We work within the NOx plan system with plans review and inspections and have that sort of cross-agency collaboration to notify the applicant that you've applied for your building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4044)|
| 1:07:35| However, there's this step in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| We reach out to them or they reach out to us, and then we take them through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| I think with this one, there would definitely be some education on the front end because those dimensional standards are different than what the average builder is used to doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4062)|
| 1:07:51| I think that would be an educational opportunity for planning to take on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| Also, we have a pretty well-integrated procedure of pre-application meetings and pre-application discussions with builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4075)|
| 1:08:05| Say that someone was considering a middle housing type, if this is approved, then we would be pretty well-versed in talking to them in advance and doing pre-application consultation on their plan to make sure that what they propose meets the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4085)|
| 1:08:20| Walk me through, and we can use infill as an example, once those decisions are made by planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4100)|
| 1:08:33| They're posted somewhere publicly, and then there's a time period for appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| I think that's something we'd want to establish for this particular code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| For historic zoning cases that go in front of the public body, in front of the design review board or the historic zoning commission, we post a yard sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4124)|
| 1:08:53| So folks that are walking around or driving around in the neighborhood see that sign and know that there's a review that's going on or just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| It links them to a website, and so they can come and look at our website and see what that is and find the appropriate staff member to contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| Administrative approvals are posted on the website as well, but an applicant or an interested member of the public would need to know to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4147)|
| 1:09:17| So I think that that's something that would be important to integrate into this process, is how do we make sure that the public is aware that these are going on, whether we post a sign or another form of public notice like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4157)|
| 1:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| So I have a couple of questions about conversion, and I have some questions about the specific dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4178)|
| 1:09:50| So I'll start with Mr. Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| Someone can explain to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| When I look at Table 4-4, middle housing dimensional standards, so a duplex, what does building width max mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4198)|
| 1:10:11| Does that mean the actual width max of the physical building, not the part of the lot you can build on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| That's the physical building can only be a max of 40 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| So for a triplex, a building could be a max of 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| The building depth could be 55 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| I just want to point out that quite a number of the houses in the historic district are bigger than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| And so when people say I'm worried you're going to convert something, the houses are too big to convert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| They're outside your chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| It's just an interesting thing I noticed sitting here measuring things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| So anyway, Mr. Berry, if I were to, if this chart doesn't exist, so today's code, R and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4258)|
| 1:11:10| if someone had a property and they wanted to do a conversion, they wanted to, what, subdivide it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| in R and 2 you could come and say I'd like to subdivide my structure and I could make a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| I'd have to do a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| I'm just curious what the process is to right now do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| It's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| It's a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| In R and 2 you'd be required to have the dimensional standards for a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| So a two family is 10,000 square feet minimum lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Any fire suppression or sprinklers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| There would be fire separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| So I couldn't just, so see that's one of the things with our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| the historic neighborhoods that were subdivided in the old days when folks were moving post World War II out to the Burbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| and they'd take a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| They'd just kind of sort of board a door closed and do things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| Remove, actually enclose the staircase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| That's actually a common thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| So you just lay boards over the staircase, take the railing out, and you have boards at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| That's not legal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| That's not code legal today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| So living in the historic district and having rehabbed some of those houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| the things that were done to subdivide the houses, even in the 80s, was literally fire traps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| like absolutely not legal, absolutely not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| I actually have an architect friend who has some pretty impeccable standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| and now as a 40-something-year-old he's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| I look back at the things I lived in in Fort Sanders and can't believe I lived there because they're not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| And that is some of the most concerning things that I've seen in the historic districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| putting crazy staircases on the outsides of things and boarding windows closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| and putting entrances in a window that are, I mean, just bananas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| Like who came up with this idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| I'd love to be sitting at the table when they came up with this crockpot idea to make a triplex, fourplex, sixplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| because I've worked with many people who undid that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| and it's just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| So there are many people maybe even here who have stories about undoing some of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| It's most entertaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| But I couldn't do that today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| I couldn't get an address for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| I couldn't create a duplex by boarding up a door or a staircase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| You'd need to submit for plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| It would be reviewed by building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| Okay, and what would it take for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| At what point do you have to sprinkle something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| How many units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| I believe it's three or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Three or more units, I've got to sprinkle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| So if we pass this code and I want to build a triplex, it's got to be sprinkled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| I'm fairly certain, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| Whoo-wee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| Last I heard, that's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| We've got before us, I guess, Ms. Ball, you sent over an amended set of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| I believe a recommendation was submitted to Planning Commission in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| We've had two public forums, if you will, where people can come see what changes have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4471)|
| 1:14:39| since that original submission to Planning Commission based on those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| The comments and the input and the conversations that we had at the two community open houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| we've also received a lot of communication from the community just directly to us at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4491)|
| 1:14:59| We've also had a salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| I don't even know exactly how many meetings over the years, but we've had a lot of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| with individuals, neighborhoods, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| And all of that, along with we had Opti-Coast Design provide a peer review of our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4512)|
| 1:15:20| So all of those together sort of helped inform some of the changes that we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| The changes were primarily focused on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| The changes were primarily to reword for clarity, remove redundant language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| We did make some changes to simplify some of the dimensional specifics to make sure that it was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| Even though we didn't necessarily always change those, we just tried to make them easier to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4543)|
| 1:15:51| There weren't substantive, I do not like the word substantive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| there weren't substantive, I do not like that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| That is a really hard word to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| I'm glad you said it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| I was going to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Changes, no changes to the intent of our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| Okay, so no substantive changes to, you made me think about it and I got it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| No substantive changes to the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| So I think the staff, I'm going to go a little different direction now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| I think the staff has done a good job of listing all the benefits of this to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| I think the list on the website is, I'll read a few of them off because I think it's very important that people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| what the fabric and the quality of life this inserts into the community or joins the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4602)|
| 1:16:49| So a few of these are add more financially attainable housing options at a wide variety of price points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| smaller more attainable homes, pathway to ownership, incremental increases in housing to existing neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| providing housing for more than one family on a single lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| opportunities for families to live in walkable neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| to help residents have more diverse housing types at a variety of sizes and price points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| So that I think is a very good picture of why this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| With that said, I think similar to Councilman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| I have a question in terms of how much this covers of the city, particularly within the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4644)|
| 1:17:32| What's the mix within that residential TDR area between R and 4, 3 and 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4652)|
| 1:17:41| So the R and 2 is 62.7% of the land area of the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4661)|
| 1:17:49| It's 2,782 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| The R and 3 is 1.8% of the land area in the TDR, relatively small, that's just 79 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4672)|
| 1:18:00| The R and 4 is 2.9% of the land area in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| So heavily focused on R and 2 in terms of the opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| R and 1 is not included, and I don't know if you have that number since it's not included in TDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| We do, it's 298 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| And what percentage would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| You can do that math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| Okay, well I've got a question for Mr. Berry while you do some phone math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| Is there a principal use difference between R and 1 and R and 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| As far as what's allowed for a principal use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Give me just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| Do you have a specific one in mind as far as the use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| If I'm understanding your question, is there a difference in principal uses in R and 1 and R and 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| Is there a difference in principal use between R and 1 and R and 2 currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| There are different principal uses that are allowed in R and 1 versus R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| Okay, do you have those handy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| While he's getting that, it's 6.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4754)|
| 1:19:25| Is your question related only to residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| So a single family residence is permitted in R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| Two family, that is a duplex, is special use in R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4776)|
| 1:19:43| Sorry, just to shorten us here since my time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Is there a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| Not are there similarities, but is there a different principal use in R and 2 versus R and 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4787)|
| 1:19:56| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| I promise it's not a riddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| In the use table, is there a principal use difference between R and 1 and R and 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| So there's a list of principal uses that are permitted in the various districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4809)|
| 1:20:17| but I'm not sure if you're getting at a specific...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| I'll come back since my time has expired and give it another shot, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| It's all good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| I was hoping we could go back to the dimensional standards, get a little bit more clarity around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4834)|
| 1:20:43| because we have building height listed in stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| but we don't have a maximum building height beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| So it's number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| We say building heights shall not exceed the maximum building height of the base zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| So for R and 2 and R and 3, that's 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| For R and 4, that's 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| But then it says, or the maximum height in stories as noted in table 4-4, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| So the height of the stories may vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| But it will always be limited to 2 or 2.5 or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| and the base zoning maximum building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| There's so much about this that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| Really what my issue is, is the areas that we're choosing to put this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| It makes me wonder when Opti-Coast identified walkable neighborhoods, they did this in many different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| yet we're choosing to do it in some of the, well, the areas that are less affluent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| the ones that were traditionally in redlined areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| and it makes me wonder if we are starting here because there's less pushback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| So although I like what we're doing, it's the areas that I'm concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| and what is the unintended consequence of going into just redlined districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| I know that's not the point, but that is what's happening by looking at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| I can speak to some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| So I think when you look at the redlining map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| it really does show the whole residential city at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| That was November 1939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| That map, most of the areas on that map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| obviously align with the traditional neighborhood boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| because those are our traditional neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| They were our central city at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| I think an argument could be made that the middle housing is missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| because of redlining-influenced zoning codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| So obviously all zoning codes are relatively intertwined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| with these redlining concepts as they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| These redlining-influenced zoning codes pushed residential projects into two extremes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| single-family houses and then larger-scale apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| and the aim here is to rectify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| The history of these areas was significantly more dense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| but due in very large part to redlining and urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| it was made less dense in the 1940s through the 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| These standards, I think this project aims to restore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| these original density patterns and the housing forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| that existed prior to redlining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| And so thinking about it being aligned with redlining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| means that isolating this area instead of the whole city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| it could have a negative effect on these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| which we don't know all the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| But it is allowing for additional investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| and a raise in property values, etc., in these specific areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| for the people that own property there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| So it's adding extra opportunity in these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| instead of disincentivizing further investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| which is what those redlining policies did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| We can't control what type of the price point of this housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| We're hoping that it is very varied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| but it's quite likely that they're all luxury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| condo-looking like fancy places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| and then the gentrification and the people who were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| get moved out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| So this is a concern that I have by using these areas specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5079)|
| 1:24:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| Yeah, I keep hearing a lot about unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| and I guess when we're focused on building on empty lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| I guess I'm not sure what those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| and why they seem to be so detrimental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| again, while we're focused on new build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| So anyway, I feel like there are a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| unintended roadblocks a little bit, or excuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| but I go back, and if I have the stat incorrect, let me know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| but if there are only, what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| 130 lots that are larger than 55 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| I don't see the housing opportunity to address, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| any real scalable impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| and looking at just duplexes, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| which is, to me, like cutting a tree with a butter knife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| but is that accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| the 130 lots that are over 65 in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| 130 lots that are over 65 in the proposed area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5168)|
| 1:26:21| No, I don't believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| So you said over 55?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| I think that's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Over 65 either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Lot frontage within the TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| over 54 to 63 feet is 123,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| and then there's 60 lots that are 63 to 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| So less than 200, but it's still pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| So I guess, again, I'm looking at the vast problem we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| and then focusing on TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| which is really sort of what, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| seems like a pretty small opportunity to address this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| I do have a question on the sprinkler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| that Council Member Ryder brought up on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Are there not any solutions or workaround?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| As I recall from the Opticos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| and their involvement with Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| I think there was that they obtained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| some kind of fire marshal exemptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| to make that an easier process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| So we've had several calls with the folks in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| and actually they have submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| to the state fire marshal for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| but they have not yet received approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| They've submitted, I don't want to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| for exactly how many different proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| to try to get a relaxation or a replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5271)|
| 1:27:58| with a different fire suppression measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| and they have not yet had approval from the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| Would that not be something that, among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| that we could look at to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| sort of ease the ability on the conversion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| They have not been successful with getting approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| from the state fire marshal for the proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| that they have put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| and they have done several of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| So we have called periodically with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| to stay in touch with the status of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| along with the other four large cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| related to missing middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| and to stay connected with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| about that type of progress that they're able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| because they're further along in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| So did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| I just wanted to clarify my numbers that I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| I apologize, those were incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| So for frontage widths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| so we're talking about anything that's 45 feet or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| there's 1,600 properties that have been identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| 1,607 that are greater than 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| That are greater than 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| Yes. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5367)|
| 1:29:43| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| I just want to address a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| I disagree with saying that there are roadblocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| because even when it comes to affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| there's roadblock community members who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| I don't want it in my backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| I don't want it in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| and so I'm going to disagree with that as far as roadblocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| It's concerns, and yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| there is such a thing as unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| for people who live on fixed incomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| people whose salaries have not increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| as aggressively as the cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| So whereas most of us who are fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| to have decent salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| or are in a different tax bracket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| there are some people that property value is going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| means property tax is going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| and that's more cost burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| that they are struggling to be able to afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| And so where we're talking about a lot of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| even with vacant lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| you put a new bill there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| that is going to improve the value in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| and to increase housing values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| And so I'm just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| that we absolutely have to take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| and especially in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| which houses the most number of Section 8 affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5465)|
| 1:31:13| apartment and neighborhoods in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| So the people who are reaching out to me in my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| and I also share that concern at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| how do we regulate that from being oversaturated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| Because once it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| it is out of our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| once a developer or an investor owns that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| Right now, the only thing that we are discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| that we can control is how it's zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| the design, the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| But we cannot, we'd be remissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| if we did not consider some of these concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| and yes, there are unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| that people in these existing communities could face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| And so that's what I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| and I'm concerned about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| I mean, the design, the sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| of course we know that those things are going to fit in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| but let's think about the neighbors there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| I know that we've had these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| with existing neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| but a lot of the people that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| that those unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| would have a negative impact on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| probably aren't members of those neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| And this is why I stated earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| that I absolutely want to take a deeper dive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| into those lots and those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| to ensure that the folks in those communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| understand what is potentially coming down the pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| and what this body will be voting on going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| You know, if anyone around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| doesn't understand that, I get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| but let's be very mindful of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| who are not as advantaged as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| I didn't realize it was my turn already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| I really appreciate what Council Member McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| had to say and wanted to echo a lot of her concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| And to that, I had two thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| I feel the need for more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| and not only a chance to review this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| but a chance to ensure that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| who are going to be directly impacted by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| understand this process and what's being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| and what we would eventually vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| And then in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| hearing the discussion and the concerns raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| well, I'd like to hear from the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| whether as a first step incorporating middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5635)|
| 1:34:05| as a special use was considered as a first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5645)|
| 1:34:13| We have some middle housing that is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| under special use at present in some of the zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| that are in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| When we were going through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| and Optico specifically recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| getting rid of special use because it is a barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| it is additional time, it is additional money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| it is additional steps that the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| has to go through to get to a point of being shovel-ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| And so it was a recommendation from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| that we work on eliminating special use needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| And I certainly understand it in certain situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| but it is also a process that brings more opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| for public input into these new developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| and more transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| And then, you know, and I've stated this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| and I believe a colleague said this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| to truly get to the affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| we're going to have to incentivize developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| And, you know, that could be something that's a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5739)|
| 1:35:47| whether it's individual homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| or whether it's a non-profit developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| but that could be an incentive that's offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| where, you know, certain fees are covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| plus additional financial support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| But that's just where my thinking is at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| How do we introduce, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| there are certainly areas where we have middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| and we have, you know, duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| that you can get on special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| But just incorporating these new building types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| and allowing the building of these new building types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| even just as a special use seems like a big step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| to me because we haven't been doing that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| And I think once the city, once the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| the broader city is able to see these developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| there may be more acceptance and excitement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| about seeing more of that type of development in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| rather than communities feeling like something's coming at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| that they weren't aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| and, you know, where we don't know how to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| ensure that we don't have a whole street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| that's, you know, transitioned over to townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| You know, we're not able to put certain protections in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| like other cities are that have more of this type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| So I think we just have to be very thoughtful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| So the comment was made about the selected map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| There's been a couple of people bring up questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| about the TDR area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| So TDR, pretty much all of those neighborhoods existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| at the time the redlining maps were made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| and I think that is what Lindsay shared with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| And so that's why they reflect being in the redlining map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| I think that's an issue of correlation, not causation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| That's one of my husband's favorite sayings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| is that something may look like it's correlation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| but it's not the causation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| It's just the timing of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| So I look at the map, and I look at places off of Wash Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| Holston Hills, Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| Those are LDR, but they didn't exist at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| Those are new places that didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| And the TDR is descriptive of places that has alleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| wider streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| Typically a lot of it has sidewalks and very narrow lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| It's the traditional old neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| So, I mean, I just wanted to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| When we had the other workshop on missing middle last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| I think, we had a lot of discussion about parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| and geographical boundaries of how to select a smaller area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| I think we talked about ADUs and duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| and, you know, we talked about is 640 the boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| There was a lot of public discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| about what the boundaries could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| Is it the river? Is it Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Is it Clinton Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Like, what is that boundary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| And staff went back and reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| and they came up with TDR as a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| And I think looking at places that have the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| like alleys and sidewalks and grid-like development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| you know, you can have a neighborhood with a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| but if it doesn't have cross streets every X amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| that doesn't give you as many places for cars to exit and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| It doesn't give you as many places for cars to come in and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| So that's what the TDR has built into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| that those neighborhoods built 1945 and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| didn't have because they were focused on cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| You come and go by your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| You don't walk down to the trolley anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| You don't walk down to the neighborhood store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| And so it's one starting point for us to look at in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| and I go back to one of the original comments I made was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| pre-World War II, we allowed these middle housing types there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| And some of them still exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| I hear some of the concerns about cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| and we can't control without subsidy how much something's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| But the one thing that we can do is make it so that you can build on existing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| We have 50-foot wide lots all over the old city areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6061)|
| 1:41:07| that you can't build on reasonably with what we passed in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| The setbacks are too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| The density, all of those things make it not as economically reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| to build something new on those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| And some of those TDR neighborhoods with 55 or 50-foot wide lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| and sometimes smaller, like I pointed out earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| the ones on Cornelia are all 37-foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| Those people can't build a shed, much less a porch, an addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| or rehab a house without going and getting a pile of variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| So we passed a code that you can't build on these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| And so that is one of the things that's baked into some of these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| And honestly, it's not enough because we still haven't addressed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| and I've asked for it multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| No offense, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| And I've put it in a spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| There was a segment of the old code that was for the North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| that reflected the dimensions of what we have in these old neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| But we passed recode and we didn't do that and we threw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| And so now we make everybody get variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| And so we add to the cost and the time to be able to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| And if we don't get things built on the inner city lots that are vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| I'm not talking about tearing down and replacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| we can't add supply to the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| And the $1,400 a bedroom rental rates are based on the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| that you have 20-plus people asking to rent every unit that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| And so until we have supply to address that, it's not affordable to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| So this is certainly not all of the answers, but it's a start to a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| Thank you. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| I want to follow on Councilman Ryder's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| I agree. I think we all understand more housing in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| at a macro level, helps the whole market be more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| And to that end, I think not including R and 1 is a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| and for a few different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| Unless you found a principal use difference, I can't find one in the use measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| Mr. Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| Sure, I'll take another try to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| So if I understood it right, single family dwellings, two family dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| they both are allowed in R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| So a single family dwelling is a permitted use in R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| A two family dwelling is a special use in R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| Thank you. Sorry, I don't want to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| That does. So to that end, I don't think there's a principal use difference between R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| We've heard a lot about renting. We all know the challenges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| Renters and homeowners want the same benefits in R and 1 neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| that R and 2, R and 3, and others want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| I think if this is a starting point, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| But our starting point, if we do this, needs to be all of us in this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| And I don't think it does us any good to offer more access to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| to live in traditional neighborhoods if we carve off a special R and 1 neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| that doesn't participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| So I think excluding R and 1 is just setting up more exclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| I think it makes up more percentage than, I think according to Lindsay's comments earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6282)|
| 1:44:49| it makes up more opportunity than R and 3 and R and 4 combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| I don't think we need to carve off R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| There's not any difference other than lot size for R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| So as a city, if we're going to provide access to everybody to live in different neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| and provide a pathway to homeownership and to rent and live in every neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| it needs to be every neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| So if TDR is the existing kind of sphere we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| we all need to grab hands and jump in this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| So I think R and 1 needs to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| Similarly, I think we are limited, this whole body knows we're limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| in our tool set for rent control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| But Minneapolis and St. Paul both just went through this similar effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| and from what I can tell, they included their equivalent R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| Also, I think we can get creative and unless somebody tells me otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6343)|
| 1:45:50| with a legal background, I don't think state law prohibits us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| from extending pilots to small scale developers who are willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| to hold rental as a percentage of AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| So if we offer incentives for big developers to build housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| with 100 units in it and hold rent at a certain percent of AMI for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| there's no reason we shouldn't do that for a fourplex owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| who's willing to provide affordable rent for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| So we can get creative within the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| I've said a lot of times and there's been some objections in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| and reasonable so that pilots shouldn't be good incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| I think they're great incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| They should be applied to big developers and small developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| The reason I think that idea is really important is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| if you follow all this through, put the character change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| of a neighborhood aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| Please don't quote me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| Somebody will, but that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| What we want to make sure is if we go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| we add affordable housing in the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| where everybody wants to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| And if you don't find some way to control rent or offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| or mitigate both demolition and just general market forces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| we're still just relying on macro level, more supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| eases demand, eases prices, which is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| But if we can get a bit more acute with our incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| pilots, for example, go through a third party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| We don't necessarily have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| We understand that there's a need for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| I think we should get very creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| And that is a way, if you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| what we want to prevent is somebody buying a single family home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| that may be old, but still livable, tearing it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| building a fourplex, and then charging rates that are unaffordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| I think that's what we, on a perfect role, would like to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| So I think we can offer some more carrots to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| And so we had an affordable housing trust fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| We have our general capital operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| We have a housing budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| And we can't offer incentives that are allowed by state law and other paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| I think that's a creative way that we can achieve all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| And again, I encourage you to look at Minneapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| They did something very similar, not just for renters, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| but for home prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| So if you built a house that someone's going to own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| they maxed the price you could use at a percentage of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| so that you could become a homeowner as part of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| And not just become a renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| Both can be possible, I think, within our state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| So R and 1 should be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| And we should get more creative to make renters have more access to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| not just a new opportunity for developers who are much needed and great and helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Yes, I really appreciate the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| I want to thank all my colleagues on council for their good questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| which answered many of the ones that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| I want to do some background work and look at some track records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| of some other cities that may have implemented this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| So Opticodes Designs can give me a list of cities or good examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| that I can go back and kind of see how it's progressed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| And then the other question I had has to do with putting it on vacant lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6562)|
| 1:49:30| demolishing a house, or then transforming a house for multi-units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6570)|
| 1:49:36| Do you know offhand if any of the cities that have implemented these designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| have basically just allowed them on vacant lots and excluded demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| or transitioning or remodeling houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| Okay, that's one piece of information I would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| because we've talked about those differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| So I would like to see if any other cities have done it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| and how that has worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| Council Member Tester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| New technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Yeah, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| First of all, I think what Council Member Smith discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| about smaller developers, I mean a lot of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| the majority of them actually went away after 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| And we lost a lot of our talent, skilled trades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| all of those over the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| And so I definitely think as we're working to try and meet this need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| it does create an opportunity for smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| affordable housing developers, developers in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| which shouldn't be a bad word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| to be able to come in and create opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| And I see people out like our nonprofit Seed in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| who is working to address this issue, which is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6674)|
| 1:51:21| And so I do think incentivizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| And just to clarify my earlier comment on unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| there always are going to be, but does that supersede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| what we need to try and accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| Because at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| we are trying to solve a remarkably huge issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| but we've got to also focus on expanding our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| It is those tax dollars that are allowing us to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| the social needs, the mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| all of the social services that we need to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| focusing on revitalizing neglected areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| It is disinvestment that created blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| that created opportunity deserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| And so it's that and property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| which they will increase as we're able to revitalize areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| but that also creates equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| It creates generational wealth that underserved communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| clamor for and are able to help provide retirement, education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| health care, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| So I know it's a fine line, but I really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| I just wanted to sort of clarify that that is a perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| that I'm coming from as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| that to Council Member Ryder's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| we have to look at all areas across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| There are a lot of areas that won't be opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| because it is too costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| So really trying to extend and create opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| so everybody can rise and hopefully find a path to success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6788)|
| 1:53:15| Thank you. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| I wanted to bring up two other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| that were raised earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| One about what are we seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| that's going on around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6811)|
| 1:53:38| There's one book that was brought to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| in the last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| that exposes kind of a trend that has taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| throughout the country around this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| It's called Selling Off California, the Untold Story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| And the dynamics just seem so similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| to what we're experiencing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| because what they have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| and what we're experiencing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| because what they saw happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| was this push for new developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| and loosening of some regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| to allow developments to more easily be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| And it was largely fueled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| by a coming together of our leaders in real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| and our leaders in the big tech world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| And so I was like, man, that's sounding like Knoxville these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| And the idea around it was not that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| this influx of new housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| would necessarily provide the affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| that the community needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| but it was following a model of what they're calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| trickle down affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| So it's like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| we don't expect it to be built as affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| but eventually in 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| it could provide affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| And so there's been a lot of pushback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| by housing justice advocates around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| that have concern because they want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| affordable housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| They want to see a diversity of options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| in the housing market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| but they also want to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| that affordability is prioritized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| and that we're not changing regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| to allow new developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| that will be high-end developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| and will price people out of their neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| and essentially constitute gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| And so that's what I have been struggling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| are the positives that I see from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| but also some of the negative consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| that we've seen in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| And just approving the plan as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| I cannot offer my constituents any assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6981)|
| 1:56:28| that that would not happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| that we would not see a form of gentrification happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6989)|
| 1:56:36| in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| So that's one of my main concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| and I'm continuing to try to think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| what protections do we need in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| And I think bringing up the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| is a really good example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| but it's an example of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7011)|
| 1:57:01| developments that have brought such a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| that we approved a review of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7027)|
| 1:57:13| of the administrative review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| for the South Waterfront form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| And I'm worried that we're developing a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7038)|
| 1:57:26| that mirrors how we work with our form-based code and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| And we're not necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| we're not hearing from the folks who live in SW1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| and taking into consideration the impacts on neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| I'm even thinking about the parking recommendations here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7068)|
| 1:57:56| are much different than what we've seen play out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| on the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| in terms of when we increase density in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| and bring in more residential and commercial options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| because I imagine this development would attract both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Planning for that density beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| the parking space requirements that are in this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| So I feel like we need more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| Thank you. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| Yes, there's a lot to study here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| I'm still in the information gathering stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| and analysis stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| A lot here I really like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| I am concerned about unintended consequences as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| I just only want to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| just to kind of keep things in perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| and this has already been alluded to by the mayor and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| is we've got a huge housing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| Passing this will just solve a fraction of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| And I may, in the end, support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| May not, we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| But I've got a completely open mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| that it's well intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| Also, as alluded to by some of my other council people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| is like, we're going to have to get bolder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| and look at places outside these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| Because if you listen to the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| about the available lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| it's, I guess it's your definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| of what would be a significant increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| in the housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| But it's going to be a fraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| Of what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| And as we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Councilperson Fugate mentioned it earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| other council people have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| is we really need to look at locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| mainly along the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| Because there's a lot of blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| along the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| There's property for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| There's retail that's gone out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| A lot of it's not coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| There's big swaths of parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| And that stuff needs to be available for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| And we would solve a lot of our infrastructure questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| A lot of impact on existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| Quality of life, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| for the residents of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| that would live on those housings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| where the infrastructure is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| And I know the city also is already looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| And we have actually done some of that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| I'm not pretending that it's going to be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| Because it's going to take a little bit of a paradigm shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| A lot of the property on the corridors is more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| But we really do need to look at a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| where we can incentivize developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| and make it appealing to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| to really look at this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| So I just wanted to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| kind of add that as a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| I just wanted to go ahead and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| that I agree that looking at the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| and examining what barriers we have there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| to developing additional housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| We've had a couple of successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| new residential areas in commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| in my district recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| Out in the Washington Pike area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| across the Home Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| I've mentioned that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| But I want to point out the reality of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| Our CG zones are 2.52% of our acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| 2.52%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| Our commercial highway zoning is 6.47%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| So if you add those two together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| commercial highway and commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| that is about 6, 7, 8, 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| Our N2 is 8.85%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| So taking the CG and the CH all together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| all of them, is equivalent to the RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| The RN1 is 26.07% of our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| So, you know, I just think we need to be realistic about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| because what we've talked about here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| and what started the conversation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| there's not one solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| So we have to do all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| So I think we have to do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| And we can only do so much simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| because we have the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| We need to not do, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| It was called Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| And I think we made some mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| And so I don't think it's a bad thing to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| in bite-sized changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| And maybe some of those are orbiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| I just want to be realistic about how much land that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| Well, I never said it was going to be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| You said it was going to be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| I wanted everybody to know what little we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| But I also think that we need to double down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| and focus on developing this blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| that's available in these corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| And there's obstacles in the way, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| But I maintain the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| that we haven't done enough to explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| And I don't have the answers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| But I have been talking to developers one-on-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| to see what the obstacles are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| and what the realities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| But I do maintain that we haven't done enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| to explore that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| I think Councilman Ryder just made a great case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| for the addition of Rn1 to add that into the mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| I agree with everything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| But on a serious note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| I do think Rn1 should be included for a thousand reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| But that's one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| It's the largest opportunity in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| And if we're going to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| we should start with at least a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| of the largest opportunity in the city included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| And I don't have any more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| but I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| I think there's plenty of room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| just in our couple hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| to find disagreement among all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| And I think we've found it in a few places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| So I just want to applaud staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| Planning Commission, and city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| for the journey you're on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| with all the opinions and perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| in different neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| that we're doing the easy part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| So I appreciate what you all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| It's methodical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| I think it makes a ton of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| I think each of us would like to tinker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| a little bit around the edges of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| and have more people weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| But the arc of this is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| So I applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| No matter how many times it takes us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| to bang it around up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| but I think you all have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| a very good job to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| I know in Opticoast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| there was a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| about the entryway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| and how important that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| And so when I went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| and looked through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| and I think there's even mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| of frontage types and discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| about porches and stoops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| but I'm curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| are those required in the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| Because it looked to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| like you had an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| to do several things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| but you didn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| have to do those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| And I know that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| a lot of importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| in that frontage piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| and just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| that I understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| whether that's required or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| That was definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| something we toyed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| It is not a specific requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| right now in these standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| It is an option to select from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| but the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| do still incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| the requirement for having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| ground-level entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| oriented towards the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| They may just not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| off a porch or a stoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| And I guess when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| talking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| they're really talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| about doors and windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| less about a porch or a stoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| One of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| is the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| for people to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| that this is going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| And I really appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| Director Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| clarifying that for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| that if you go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| this administrative process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| that you have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| to appeal to Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| which would then lead to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| So I think having a kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| of review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| and laying that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| and you clarifying that with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| I do think that giving some notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| so people know that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| So the discussion today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| about having a sign put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| I think was a really good one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| that was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| The other takeaway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| that I thought of as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| is obviously we need housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| and missing middle is a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| And I think we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| everybody talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| being an incremental approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| And I really do appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| I think it's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| for us to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| not only housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| and missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| but then also thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| things that we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| along the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| and the mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| that we had provided for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| So I also want to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| to explore that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| because I think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| such a demand that's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| addressing supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| and opportunities there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| because we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| successful businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| along the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| and going to mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| with residents above that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| I think would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| So looking at everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| and that's been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230928?start=7682)|
