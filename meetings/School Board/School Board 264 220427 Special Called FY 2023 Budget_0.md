| 0:01:34| Mr. Jin is unable to be here tonight due to an out-of-town college visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| We wish him safe travels as we keep him in our thoughts and as he makes these important life decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| Also, Miss Horn is out-of-town on business so, as was public notice last week, is attending electronically this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=107)|
| 0:01:55| So, do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| So, a motion by Miss Satterfield, a second by Mr. Watson. All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=126)|
| 0:02:15| Does it have no public forum? No public forum. We do not have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=135)|
| 0:02:26| Item 6, approve resolution and participating employer agreement authorizing classified employees of Knox County Schools to participate in the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System effective July 1, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=146)|
| 0:02:43| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| So, a motion by Miss Fab and a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=166)|
| 0:02:53| Mr. Bolton, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| Absolutely. Can you hear me now? Okay. It might be a little hot, so I'll back up. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| I want to take a few minutes to just walk you through the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| I won't go too much into the specifics with the information that you have there because I want to allow for plenty of time for you to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| Should you have any. Before I start, I want to recognize some folks that are in the audience with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| We have Jennifer Schroeder and Nala Brashears from the Knox County Pension Board Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| There they are. They're here in support of this move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| And we also have Justin Ball, representative from from TCRS here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| So, if there's any kind of questions that get into the weeds, I think we've got some experts in the room that can answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| Let me start with talking about the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=218)|
| 0:03:46| Okay. There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| Overall, the reason why we want to look at it, these are really the reasons that we're looking at this particular move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| We're talking about improved recruiting, particularly in a lot of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| We can talk about rehires with Knox County retirees and those that have withdrawn their retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| which is otherwise prohibited by the Knox County Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| There's a period of 120 days that have to expire before we could hire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| And for the first time, all of our employees, all of our new hired employees will be on the same retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| So essentially they would have the same benefit lineup, which right now they go into two different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| This move also solidifies some of our plan compliance for both the Knox County Asset Accumulation Plan and for TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=268)|
| 0:04:37| And also an issue with some of our fiduciary responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| I draw on the question with the asset plan, I don't know that we're necessarily doing enough to provide adequate education under that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| And then the last thing is lower mandatory employee contributions for some of our lowest earners in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=289)|
| 0:04:57| So in looking at the Knox County Asset Plan, it's currently what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| All new hires that come into the system are hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| These are classified folks that are hired in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| It's a mandatory 6% employee contribution and 6% employer contribution match in an asset plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| There is an enhancement with the plan where there is an additional 2% match that will be given after five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| and a match after 10 years and a match after 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| We go over all this information at employee orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| We spend time talking about it, but a lot of people before they get the opportunity to get additional match funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| it's five years into their employment with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| And so a lot of times what happens is they forget about what they saw in the orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| and we're just, there's not a lot of people that are really utilizing that additional match funds as the plan lays out, designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=343)|
| 0:05:53| So when we're talking about the asset accumulation plan, you'll hear it referred to as a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| Defined contribution means that the employer contribution amounts going into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| and the employee contribution amounts going into the plan, those amounts are defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| It does not define the benefit that you draw off the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| So when a person goes to the point of retirement, they've got money, assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| and then that assets could be your benefit will be paid out to whatever you choose at retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| in terms of maybe annuity or something like that where you have a guaranteed benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| But it's an asset of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| It's not a defined benefit that guarantees you a payment based on certain principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| And so you'll hear this type of plan, it's like a 401K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| but you'll hear this type of plan being referred to as a defined contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| because the contribution is what's defined on the end of the plan and not the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| TCRS, the proposed group that we're moving to, talk about the closed legacy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| The legacy was a full defined benefit plan and that plan closed on July 1st of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| All new teachers hired after that point were hired into the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| And so the hybrid plan is a blend of the defined benefit and the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| So it takes a little bit of what you get similar to what you got with the legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| and couples it with what you would have under the Knox County asset plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| Our current employer contribution is 10.63 in that legacy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| but it's actually dropping drastically down to 8.69 in this upcoming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| I think that will be covered in the budget outlay when talking about some savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| On our hybrid folks, I don't know if you know about TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| but it is one of the most stable public pension programs in the union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| It's phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| It ends up funding more than 100% funded from year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| And if you look on our ACFR, and we'll talk about that in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| the financial statements report in assets instead of liabilities because it's so well funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| But in talking about that, Tennessee was on the forefront of a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| in looking at how can we prevent against issues that may happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| when they look through that 2009-2008 downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| And when they looked at it, the solvency of the plan was even made more solvent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| with the creation of the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| But what this guarantees with this hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| it's a mirrored plan of what the teachers have that we're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| and it is a flat contribution rate of 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| So it is a flat 9%, and this is called the hybrid plan with cost cut measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| So when you say contribution, is it contribution from non-state schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| or is it from the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| So on both plans, it will be a 5% contribution required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| mandatory contribution on the employee side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| I'm focusing on the employer side of the 9% would be on the employer side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| Okay, so the non-state schools would contribute 9%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| the employees would do 5% versus the 6% they currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| The TCRS recommends an additional 2% deferral, which would be a 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| It's not mandatory, but they do recommend a 2% deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| And so folks could take that up to 2% and automatically defer to the 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| if a person takes no action, but that person can draw down that to 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| on the mandatory side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| A little different from the 6% that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| there's no flexibility in that plan, so good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| Okay, so the determination of the teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| when we're talking about what is a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| you think it's a pretty simple answer, but it's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| It causes a lot of issue for us, and it causes a lot of issue for Jennifer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| in making that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| We have had issues that we've had to resolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| and that correction is ugly, it costs the district money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| and it's very difficult when you're looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| because you have to make a decision based on this statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| does this person meet the definition of a teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| And it's not just as simple as, you know, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| you have a teacher that teaches third grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| you have somebody who has a teaching license, clearly they're a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| But the statute is much more complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| It talks about everything, you'll see everything from a physical therapist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| an occupational therapist, you'll see everything from a licensed as a nurse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| you'll see a lot of things in there that we have to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| when we manage that plan, and the corrections can be very complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| moving from one plan to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| The movement to this plan puts everybody in the same exact plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| and eliminates those issues, mitigates those risks going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| So that's the definition of the teacher plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| that causes teachers access currently to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| So the hybrid plan with cost cut measures, this is the way that it lays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| You have a defined contribution amount, a DC plan, very similar to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| and then you have a DB plan, which a defined benefit means the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| on the back end when you decide to retire is defined based on factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| I used a visual representation on this very much like the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| This is a picture of the DC plan in the hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| You have a defined set of assets going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| and then your payout at retirement is going to be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| on the assets that are in the bucket at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| The defined benefit side of it, and this is where Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| the state of Tennessee was very creative when they looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| You actually have in this particular plan a stabilization trust reserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| so you are overfunding the plan so that your employer contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| will never exceed that 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| So there's mechanisms built in this plan so that you can guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| that your percent rate is going to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Every year from legacy, you'll see fluctuation on what that employer percent will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| This controls that contribution amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| These are a list of the cost controls that guarantee that not to deviate from that 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| You've got that in front of you in terms of what guarantees your defined benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| and the payout, and those are your retirement eligibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| I'm going to skip through those and talk about our potential transition plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| As proposed in this plan, all new classified employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| those are the employees that don't meet that state statute for teacher by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| will be enrolled in this TCRS plan if it's the pleasure of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| The difference from this, all of those new full-time employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| are going to be mandatory in TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| The caveat to that is our part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Our part-time employees will be optional members in TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| and I'll give you this example of food service employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| those that are below four hours daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| We have food service employees that work four hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| They're regularly scheduled people, making roughly about $8 per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| four hours a day, about $32 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| Those folks are mandatory in our local pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| With this resolution, they will have the option to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| So that would save them 6% of their contribution at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| So that's proposed in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| What we're looking at in order to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| all current employees that wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| So what we're doing is we're not excluding those current employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| from opting into the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| but we're not providing back service in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| So what that means is if I was in the asset plan in 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| I can't then claim TCRS service back to 80| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| because that's going to be an additional cost incurred to the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| and we wanted it to be nice and clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| when we're talking about fiscal management of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| So with that being said, all employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| we're going to roll out an education campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| a three-phased education campaign in conjunction with TCRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| where it's going to be a broad campaign, both virtual and person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| where we're talking about the overviews of both plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| Then we'll funnel down into individual plans that we will conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| and then we'll refer out to folks who are licensed to talk about funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| That will be with our Empower group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| which are the folks that manage the D.C. side of the TCRS plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Okay, talking about the estimated FY23 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| and this is what's been programmed into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| To capture what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| we looked at the total number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| that would currently be in the asset plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| and you'll see on the left-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| that's their total salary per fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| And on the middle thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| you'll see the total number of employees that would account for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| If you look at the TCRS amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| or the Knox County Asset Accumulation Plan amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| that would be assuming they would be contributing 6% to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| The TCRS, 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| So what we're talking about that in year one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| we're talking about an estimated budget impact of $130,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| is what we budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| We've estimated about $121,000 is what we can anticipate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| depending on the employees that we hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| We feel pretty good about that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| I want to talk about the max contribution amount under TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| So this is not likely to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| I think this is very improbable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| And as a matter of fact, we wouldn't allow it to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| but I think it's something for us to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| If every employee currently were in TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| so if tomorrow everybody rolled into TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| what would be our contribution amount at that point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| It would be about $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| It would be $1.683, you know, so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| That would be the total max contribution rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| if everybody was on TCRS tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| I don't see that as being the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| I see $130,000 this year, maybe some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| and we'll work through some of those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| But what's nice about our rollout plan in terms of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| and we're taking nine months to educate people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=978)|

| 0:16:26| Those folks will make a decision of whether they want to opt in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| or stay put by January the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| So that way we can determine what exactly would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| the budget impact in FY25's budget and program that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| so it doesn't put us at a disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| when we're looking at funding this decision that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Okay, so we've talked about new hires coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| but how many people currently, as certified people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| are in the Knox County plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| There are no certified people in the Knox County plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Oh, I don't mean to, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| I'm getting out of terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Yeah, how many classified people do we have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| in the Knox County plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| I'd say approximately 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| And so really the expectation is for new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| New people won't have a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| and they would go over to this old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Do we have an estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Because, I mean, just talking to some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| for some of our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| it would not be an advantage for them to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| So do we have any sense of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| do we really think any of these 2,500 will move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| or probably most of them would stay in Knox Counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| You know, I think to wage a guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| at exactly how many would move, I would be afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| That's why we designed the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| so we could capture exactly how many we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| for the budget impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| But I would say the majority of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| overwhelming majority, are probably going to stay put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| There's a benefit for them to stay where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| So we don't see 2,500 people switching over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| or even 1,100 people switching over, we don't think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| I don't think that would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| And obviously, I mean, I know you don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| And to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| I think when we were looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| in terms of the benefit investment of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| let's say hypothetically all of them did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| I think $1.7 million of that investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| I think is money well spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| when we're talking about moving this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| in terms of what it offers to our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| I kind of think about it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| when we're talking about the asset plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Our asset plan and our pension board folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| are phenomenal people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| But to really take advantage of that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| you have to have a knowledge base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| You have to max out your max contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| whether it's in that 6% and those additional matches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| You've got to max out that MERC plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| to get the most out of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| And then you really need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| at least maybe somebody doing your managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| your mutual blends or however that is to some level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| You have to actively do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| The nice thing about TCRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| is it's kind of like a set it and forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| It's like everything is automated under that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| so that you don't have to actively do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| And I would say the majority of our classified employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| would probably fall into the category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| of I'm just going to not necessarily touch it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| to get the maximized benefit from the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| So that's why I think certainly they would benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| from the TCRS plan there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Let me talk about just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| so we're talking about the match contribution rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| Only about 9.4% of those 2,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| even contribute additional into that 457| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| that would be eligible for a match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| And so it's a very small percent of our people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| who are taking advantage of the additional asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| Matter of fact, I tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| what I hope that comes out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| I hope that it's the pleasure of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| to move our classified folks to this plan going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| And I hope that this discussion spurs an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| in the current classified folks that want to stay in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| but they actively look at their accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| actively contribute for the additional match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| So either way, I think this is a good exercise for our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| and they'll benefit greatly from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| So when we're looking at the max,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| I told, our plan is an extremely generous plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| and I looked and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| what if, what if, not likely to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| but what if every classified employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| all 2,500 employees in the asset plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| contributed the maximum amount to get the match?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| What percentage would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| And the calculation I came up with was 10.34%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| So if everybody contributed what they would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| that would be 10.34,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| which is actually more than what the contribution rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| to TCRS would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Do I think that would ever happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| I don't think that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| I think that's not likely to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| But if we're talking about a ceiling cost with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| this actually has a higher ceiling than the move to TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| Another thing that I was concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| when I'm looking at things like this is borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| You know, we're a district that grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| We've got several projects that we are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| in terms of school buildings and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| And so bond rate is something that we need to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| at least on the forefront of our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| So I worked along with CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| that's the county assistant folks that help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| state employees that kind of help us look at those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| And I want to draw your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| to the net pension liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| When they're determining your bond rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| they look at your total net pension liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| And if you look at this particular chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| what you'll see is our closed EB plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| that are local plans that are managed locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| You're seeing that those are very, very large liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| I mean, it doesn't cause us any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| We've got an amazing bond rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| We've got an amazing bond rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| It keeps our financing down on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| But when you look at the current TCRS plans that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| if anything, they're actually helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| keeping our bond rate good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| because they actually measure as assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| And you're going to net out those assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| when you look at your total pension liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| So actually, it may actually even improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| our position in terms of borrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| by moving our classified folks to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| Again, our rationale to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| and I want to talk about improved recruiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| Back not that long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| we had a lot of folks that were K-6 certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| that would come to our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Matter of fact, we had more K-6 certified teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| than we had positions to offer those teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| And those people would come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| and they would work in the classroom as teaching assistants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| until a position opened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| that they were certified to move into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Some of those folks would work five years or seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| before that opportunity would present itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| and they would move into a certified classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| What happened with that is they would have to then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| start all over when they moved into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| So that time that they invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| working as a teaching assistant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| was not time that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| towards their service retirement date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| With this move, it makes that consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| And what happens with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| it enhances our current Grow Your Own program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| which builds upon that base of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Those that may not have certification presently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| but are working towards certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| when they become a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| that is time well spent being a TA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| because those five or six years it took for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| maybe to get certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| is time that's also going to transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| to their teaching retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| So I think that it really significantly enhances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| our Grow Your Own programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| As we look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| that's probably one of the areas that miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| As a matter of fact, when we look at East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| if you look at East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| there are only three school districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| where their classified employees are not on TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| It's Knox County, Meigs County, and Hancock County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| And as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Meigs County is going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| They may have already approved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| but I think their intention is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| at the beginning of this fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| to move on to TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| So it's not like we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| in the majority of having a local plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| We're actually in the minority of having a local plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| So another thing is it allows us to hire people quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| What happens a lot of times when we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| issues that give Jennifer and I heartburn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| you know, I was talking about that four-hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| food service employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| So let's say that four-hour food service employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| needs to take out some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| They have an unforeseen expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| What often happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| and it happens in a lot of our exit interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| in that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| is they will resign their position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| just so they can access their pension money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Now what happens with that is we can no longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| when they take that withdrawal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| we cannot rehire them for 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| because that is what is in the plan documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| So it puts us at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| It puts them at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| So for them having an optional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| where they can opt out of putting that 6%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| nets them more money in real time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| when we're talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| So again, it simplifies our interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| of the definition of a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| When we talk about fiduciary responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| we have very few people that are contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| in that additional match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| and so we really need to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| our employee training to make people aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| We just don't necessarily have the capacity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| And again, if you want to increase the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| to be able to do what's right by the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| you're talking about incurring additional costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| and personnel to be able to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| Another thing that we talked about with TCRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| for the rationale is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| lower mandatory contribution rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| For part-time employees, they're optional members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| so they can choose not to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| That's 6% savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| The mandatory contribution rate is 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| so that's 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| TCRS recommends an additional 2% referral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| which would bring that up to 7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| but a person can't conceivably drop that down to 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| which means more net money in their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| And for some lower earners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| when we're talking about on the benefit side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| it's less of an issue to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| For anybody that understands how Social Security works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| and Social Security takes the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| of your highest 35 years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| pushes it through a formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| And that formula in it has bend points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| that bends up lower earners and bends down higher earners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| So those folks that maybe can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| to contribute the additional 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| they're going to get that benefit hypothetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| when it comes to Social Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| in terms of those bend points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| So, anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| That's clear as mud, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Clear as mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| Ms. Beth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I have a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Okay, so when we were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| most of the surrounding counties are on this TCRS plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| so if we hire someone directly from, like, Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| can they just stay within the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| and they can keep their tenure in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| or whatever you call it like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Are there benefits in that way is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| That is a great point to put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| And I'm glad you brought that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| because that's where a lot of our issues come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Because there are a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| that we hire in a classified department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| that come from surrounding districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| when they're on TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| So the problem is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| is they don't meet the definition of a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| to roll into TCRS for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| So it creates an issue if we roll them into TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| which would lead to corrections that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| Okay, so that's a smooth transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| And then I guess the one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| because we do keep talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| that they only have the 5% contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| which is a benefit for them for more take-home pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| which is sometimes our lower paid salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| but it almost sounded like they have to choose the 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| or they're automatically 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| It is what we would call an automatic deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| which in the retirement literature is what's recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| They recommend, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| if I were to make a recommendation to the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| under that asset plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| but they can't do it in their plan document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| but an automatic deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| because people are unaware of that additional money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| so that when you do the automatic deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| they become aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| they can take it back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| It's a no issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| I mean, I just hope that we are well-educating people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| because I think so many people today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| when they're finding our jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| as much as we would like for them to be thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| long-term about these benefits that we know is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| people are thinking about their take-home pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| and if they're really not aware that they have the choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| to choose the 5% versus the 7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| I just hope that if we choose this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| that we are well-educating people on the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| to choose the lower rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| if that's in their benefit to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| And what we do is if we move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| right now we're having to manage actually three different plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| because we're having to talk about the legacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| we're having to talk about the Knox County Asset Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| and by and large our new hires are all in the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| It really simplifies that orientation piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| when we only have to talk about one retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| And so that we can devote times to what's maximizing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| for them and what's issues that they may see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| So that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| And then my last question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| for our current classified people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| there's really no downside for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| because they can choose to stay where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| or they can look at the benefits of moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| So they're not going to be forced to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| if they're currently in a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1812)|

| 0:30:25| but you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| And I'm thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| And I'm thankful, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| that you came analyzing the data in a lot of different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| and looking at a lot of times you make big decisions like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| and there's a lot of unintentional consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| So I think you did a good job trying to dive in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| And I appreciated our conversation yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| So at the max, if everybody moved over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| we said it would be around 1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| About 1.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| It's about 1.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Yeah, yeah, something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| which equates to about $28 per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| And actually, randomly enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| it equates to 0.28% of our total $591 million budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| which to me, when you look at it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| it's not that big of a potential financial impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| You've already talked a lot about the potential gains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| and I really appreciate the comments that you made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| around grow your own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| making it easier for people to transfer from other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| into our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| people being able to take advantage of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| that they already spent as a TA and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| So what are the potential cons, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| in your mind of making this switch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| So that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| When I look at this investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| I look at the budget that's getting ready to be proposed to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| And in that budget, there is a recommendation for 2.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| I think it's $25.5 million in investments and salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| increase in health insurance, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| This would be rolled up in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| And so when I look at that $25.5 million investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| that we're investing in our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| if it were 1.7, which is highly unlikely for that to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| that is even a small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| So to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| I think that some people looking at it would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| hey, you are tying up our county to a fixed increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| of whatever this contribution rate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| And my response to that is we're doing the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| with that $25.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| So when you look at it, it is an investment in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| And I can give you kind of anecdotal data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| that ever since this has been rolling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| that people have been hearing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| The phone has been ringing in my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| about the excitement that people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Inside of our organization, there are people that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| we're just classified, they don't care about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| And I feel like for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| even though some may not be able to see this as a benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| it may be more beneficial for them to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| but it does bring light to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| that we're highlighting something that's good for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| And so that would be the only cost is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| the only negative is that we would be that 1.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| you're talking about that liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| But if we did a better job of doing what we're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| in terms of educating people on the piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| we'd have the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| But even then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| and I appreciate the calculation around the ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| I mean, not that we would ever reach that ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| but the ceiling is still actually greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| in the current plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| And I do think it's an important comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| around morale across our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| to be able to say, hey, we're getting the same benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| as our certified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| And also too, I'm sure you would agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| I mean, right now in public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| we need to be paying specific attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| to how we're taking care of our employees, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| I mean, you mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| how somebody might in years past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| be a TA for five to seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| waiting for an open position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| What we're seeing now is the trend is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| sometimes we're having positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| that we're not able to fill, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Yeah, so I think the more and more that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| as Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| to make sure that we're as attractive a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| as possible to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| is going to directly benefit our students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| Because to the degree that people want to work here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| and stay here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| that's going to benefit them in terms of the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| I want to add one thing to what you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| because I failed to mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| The State Board of Ed reported in 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| that there were 700 less teachers produced statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| than in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| And we're talking about a very short span of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| We're talking about a time of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| And if we understand what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| the need for teachers continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| And so, really, our base of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| are going to come from a Grow Your Own program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| And so, if anything, more than ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| this is imperative to making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| we're doing what's right by people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| and really growing our own program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| And this significantly enhances that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2099)|
| 0:35:08| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Scott, I think it's a good plan that you all put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| My, I guess, greatest fear is that the people we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| with the salaries that they make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| they may not want to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2129)|
| 0:35:37| But what about if they decide not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| and then, after a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| they decide they want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| I noticed the thing you gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| They had to notify as of January 1, 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| in order for it to begin on July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| Is there a six-month gap on any of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Or can they do that anytime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| That is a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| And I'll answer it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| We built that in so we could determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| what the budget impact was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| We really wanted to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| when we're making this particular move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| we want to be good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| So we wanted to be able to account for that budgetarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| To answer your question, the window would open up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Because when we opt into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| anybody that's in the Knox County asset plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| become optional members in TCRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| so that there can be another bite at the apple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| should they consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| And that's something that we can explore as a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| We want to be careful because we want to capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| what kind of budget impact we would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| So that's why we're trying to control the migration of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| so that we can capture it budgetarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| allocate the appropriate amount of money to make it happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| so that we're not taxing the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| In your opinion, after, say, a year or two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2225)|
| 0:37:13| there wouldn't be likely enough people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| that would want to opt in at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| to have a significant impact on the budget at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| I think that's very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Honestly, in my quick analysis back at the envelope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I think that the overwhelming majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| because a lot of times what we're talking about, the turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| when we talk about, when I looked at those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| it ranged between 300 and 400 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| typically that turnover exists in certain categories of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| So we have a lot more stability at some of the other scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| Those folks are likely to stay in the TCRS plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| or the Knox County Asset Plan because of the time that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| Their retirement eligibility is going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| So they're likely to stay in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| What we're talking about, these kind of transient people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| where we see those higher attrition rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| those are ones that we might see that opt into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| So I don't anticipate seeing that it's going to be a huge burden ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I just want to say a couple of things from the employee perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| When I transferred to Knox County back in olden times in the 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| TCRS was so easy that I don't really remember it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| It's not like changing your health insurance that we would all dread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| It was incredibly easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| And of all the state departments that I've ever had to call and talk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| they have also been the most helpful, the most informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| They answer the phone as soon as you call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| and they're very knowledgeable and helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| So I think when an employee has to deal with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| it's a very easy, easy experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| I'd also point out that the definition of a teacher is something that could be fluid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| because the legislature has tried to change that several times in recent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| and that could cause additional trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Also, for TCRS, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| legislators were looking at that as a place where they could maybe move some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| because it had been in the black and other accounts weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| Because TCRS has consistently been in the black because they manage everything so very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| Thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Is there any further discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| So we have a motion by Ms. Babb and a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| So all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| Item 7, approve the fiscal year 2023 general purpose budget at the major category level for $591,500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2417)|
| 0:40:31| So motion by Mr. McMillan, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| Superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Let me just say, too, about Scott's presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| I appreciate Scott's passion, obviously, about benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| I don't believe I've ever seen anybody quite as passionate about it as Scott is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| which is great for our employees because he's looking out for welfare of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| as well as welfare of our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Once upon a time when I was in personnel, at the time we called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| our classified employees were on a different health insurance plan than our certified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| They were on a different pension plan than our certified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| And Mr. Watson touched on what I wanted to say there, that I think from a morale standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| to have all your employees participating in the same plans is really a good thing for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| And, again, I'm just very pleased that the board did vote to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| So thank you very much for your support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| I had hoped at one point in time before I ever left this district that we could get everybody on the same benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| And this does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| So I'm quite happy and excited about the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| And, Scott, I just really appreciate your depth of knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| and your passion about the benefits and helping with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| And I also appreciate our guests that are here from County Pension Plan and also from TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| So thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| So approving an annual budget is one of our most important responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| and I appreciate the chance to present some highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| And I won't take a long time with this as the board begins discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| But before I make my remarks, I wanted to especially thank our budget team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| I think our board members know our budget team, Joe Snyder and Joni Joyce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| for all of their long, long hours and hard work on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| I know they put in a lot of time and a lot of time after work as well with formulating this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| So, as you know, our strategic plan guides the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| and this budget proposal takes several important steps toward the goals outlined in our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| Last fall, we asked our community to respond to a budget survey to help inform us about their priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2570)|

| 0:43:01| In addition to the surveys, we held a community budget meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| and we had a few of our board members to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2585)|

| 0:43:11| And results of our survey indicated that among the community's top priorities were increasing teacher pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| hiring and retaining quality teachers, and maintaining student-teacher ratios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| And I'm happy to say these priorities are included in this budget recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2604)|

| 0:43:46| This evening, I'm recommending a general purpose school fund budget of $591.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| which represents a 9% increase over last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| I believe this is a fiscally sound budget and is within our forecasted revenue projections for this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| This increase is primarily the result of strong revenue growth we've seen from the local option sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| which enables us to make significant investments in a number of areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| that I believe will have a very positive impact for our students and our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| At the top of the list, the very top of the list, is compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| We have long recognized that our district must do better from a compensation perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| not only because it's the right thing to do, but also because of the strong local and regional competition for talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2665)|
| 0:44:33| We have lost 35 teachers to other districts this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| Twenty-eight of these teachers moved to school districts right next door to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| We continue to see smaller surrounding districts with fewer vacancies come in and take our best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| so we must continue to improve our salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| This budget provides a 4% salary increase for all certified and classified staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| and this will be the third time in four years that our district has provided such a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| For the second consecutive year, this budget includes an additional 4% increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| for a total of 8% for our custodians, educational assistants, and school clerical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| This recommended budget also includes a new retirement enhancement, which we just talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| that will allow classified employees to participate in the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| which is currently available only to certified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2725)|

| 0:45:33| I believe a move to the TCRS is the right move at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| especially since it aligns with our strategic goal of building a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| At the same time, we recognize that compensation increases should be paired with appropriate staffing levels at each school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| particularly given the tremendous strain imposed on our students and our staff by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2749)|

| 0:48:58| and we look forward to answering any questions that you might have about any of the details or specific items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| So thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board, for allowing me to speak briefly about our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| I've been doing this a long time. I believe this is maybe the best budget I believe I've ever seen us have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| So I'm sure you have questions, and we'll talk about that. So thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| Thank you, Superintendent. So we have a motion by Mr. McMillan and a second by Ms. Satterfield. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2964)|
| 0:49:34| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd like to pass around just a little spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| When it comes to you, if you'll be sure you take two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| And it's not anything specific to the numbers in the budget. It's specific to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2982)|
| 0:49:51| It's very difficult to complain about a budget this good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| However, the process is a little concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| In past years, for at least the last decade, we have had our line-item budget well before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3004)|
| 0:50:15| And our policy requires that the proposed budget be available for inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| and be posted prominently on the website for the public to be able to see as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3020)|
| 0:50:30| Coming to us when it is almost the deadline for it to go to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| when it's almost time for it to go to the mayor and to council, that's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| Because even though this is a great budget, the community still deserves to be able to have time to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3043)|
| 0:50:52| and to consider the things that are in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| So the little spreadsheet that I've passed around is just for us to kind of look at moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3055)|
| 0:51:04| and consider how we need this process to work so that we can be fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3064)|
| 0:51:12| I think as one of the highest compensated boards in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| we should at least be willing to meet and discuss these things as often as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3077)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| Thank you, Ms. Owen. Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3088)|
| 0:51:36| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| Thank you, Madam Chair. I agree it's hard to argue any of the points of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| And in the sense of, you know, it's great when you have the revenue that we're projecting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| I think it is important to note to the public that some of what you see in that budget is budget versus budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| which is not budget versus actual. It's two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| And so it's not that we're necessarily seeing $45 million in new revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| It's about a 2% increase, correct, over what our actuals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| So that's still a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| But I just want to make sure that people understand that it's not necessarily a windfall in the sense of $50 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| that we weren't expecting like we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| One of the things I want to highlight in the budget, and I really appreciate that we're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| and I think it's something to kind of remember throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| is that in the budget there's about $300,000 to do a study around our salary schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| When was the last time that that was done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| Last time we had a salary study was in the late 80s, 88, 90, some, that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3174)|
| 0:53:02| Yeah, yeah. So it's been a minute, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| So about 85%, is that right, about 85%, 83.2% of our budget is wrapped up directly in our people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3184)|
| 0:53:13| in terms of our salaries and our benefits and all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| I mean, we're in the people business, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I mean, we've got to have people to educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| And so I really appreciate the administration's effort to really do a deep dive analysis of our salary schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| and how they're structured because there are ways to adjust those and provide more benefit to our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| but also make us more attractive as a school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| especially when we consider what Mr. Thomas said about even losing teachers to surrounding districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| So I look forward to that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| and I hope there's some really good proposals made to the board in this following year related to that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3229)|
| 0:53:57| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Also, too, I do want to give a shout out to our folks in the budget office, Joe and Joni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| So some of the public may not realize that the team meets with us as individual school board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| really for as long as we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| I think my meeting lasted about two hours and do a really good job at diving into the numbers with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| helping make sure that we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| We pepper them with questions afterward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| I know I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| I know many of us do to be able to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| And I also really appreciate the efforts of our communications team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| really hearing from the board last year about how can we engage the public more in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| So the survey that was done and to have 4,500 responses and doing that as early as we did back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| I know when I had my budget meeting, one of the things that I asked Joe and Joni was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| how did we take those 4,500 responses and really apply them to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| And they had really good responses for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| I didn't feel in any way that they just said, yeah, we took that database and just stuck it over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| and we did what we wanted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| So I really appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| And the other thing I want to highlight is it did not make this really huge packet that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| but in our presentation and our individual board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| there was a sheet there that basically tied the budget to the three elements of our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| And I know that's a question that I've continued to ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| how does this budget relate and help us move this plan forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| Because at the end of the day, regardless of what we put in a formal strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| the budget is our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| I mean, that is the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| And so I really appreciate the efforts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| So flipping the coin, I didn't even think to go through this analysis of a spreadsheet over process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3335)|
| 0:55:44| I always appreciate Ms. Owen's detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| I will say as a person who works on budgets in my organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| which is a lot smaller than Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| I would like to be involved in the budgeting process earlier, not because not out of control or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| but just I think there is an opportunity to have more critical discussions as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| because I think this act is one of the most important things that we do as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| is approving a budget and making sure that we set that tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| And so in the same ways that we've looked for ways to engage the community in more meaningful ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| I think there's probably some opportunities to kind of shift the way we engage the board through the process too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| And again, don't hear that as a criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| Like the interactions I have around the budget are very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| I just think there's opportunities for us as a board to be engaged a little bit earlier and in more meaningful ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| so that way we can make sure that for our constituents, we're able to say to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| hey, here's the way that I'm trying to help speak into this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| and make sure that we have the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| So is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3417)|

| 0:57:16| So that's how important education is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| That's how important our children are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3438)|

| 0:57:44| these are all things that I heard from the community for the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| And so I just think that this is a very thoughtful budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| And thank you for including the community in this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3470)|

| 0:59:00| can you just speak a little bit to the fact that we're having to maybe slow down some things we were trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| because of just things within the county and the overall financial management of our capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| And when we had originally talked about it, we were looking at slowing down more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| But what we have done, we've proposed a $48 million capital budget for FY23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3564)|
| 0:59:32| and that allows us to continue the projects that we've already got ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| Plus it will also allow us to start an addition renovation at Sturkey Elementary School with a 250-student addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3577)|

| 1:00:08| to relieve the stress that that site is seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| But of that $48 million, we went back and looked at the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| and we are asking for a fund balance designation at next week's board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3620)|
| 1:00:28| As a matter of fact, for $8 million, which will bring our debt incurred next year down to about $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3628)|
| 1:00:36| So we'll prepay some of that, and we'll use that debt to go ahead and pay for our security upgrades money that's in that capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3636)|
| 1:00:48| We'll use it to pay for physical plant upgrade line that's in the capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| and we'll also use it to pay for the first year of the Sturkey Elementary project, which will largely be designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| The only thing that we have delayed in this budget from our previous discussion is we have five schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| that we believe we really need to do an entire replacement of the HVAC systems on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| The cost of those replacements will run $3 to $5 million per school, and we need to start working it in each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| We had originally planned to ask for $4 million to do a replacement of the HVAC system at Cedar Bluff Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3682)|
| 1:01:34| We have moved that back into the FY24 capital plan, which has slid it to one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3694)|
| 1:01:43| So we think we can do that with minimal risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| If we have a challenge, there's a possibility we could have to make a $40,000 or $50,000 repair to that system before we get it replaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3710)|
| 1:02:00| but that's what our potential exposure is from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| Thank you. So with those four to five systems that we basically pushed all of them back one year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| So we pushed Cedar Bluff, and that affects the other ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| And you talked about a potential $40,000 to $50,000 repair. Do we feel like any of those are at risk of actually failing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| And then the second question, and I appreciate you bringing it up, I think especially for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| whenever they hear HVAC, there's a lot of potential concerns that a community kind of starts thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| What are the particular issues, and are they issues that are affecting our students? Does that make sense what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3750)|
| 1:02:39| I'll let Mr. Tao talk about this if I get this wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| but our concern is the age of the systems and the design of the systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| and they're not efficient systems for us to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| We don't believe any students are at risk in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| We have what I believe is a very good and proactive preventative maintenance program in our HVAC department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3780)|
| 1:03:09| and when you talk about risk, we're always at risk of an HVAC failure anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3789)|
| 1:03:18| So that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| The challenge, I think, with some of the systems that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| is they are larger systems that cool and heat large portions of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| and what we have moved to in recent years are HVAC systems that generally have many different smaller units in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3814)|
| 1:03:44| that will heat and cool individual classrooms or pairs of classrooms or the gymnasium, the auditorium, the cafeteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3824)|
| 1:03:55| and those units sort of stand alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| So if you have a failure, you don't have a failure in half of the building or the entire building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| and that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Thank you. That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Last question is do you have any potential concern about this being pushed back another year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| Like if we move through this year, do you see any reason why we might be having the same conversation about pushing it another year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| Well, each year stands alone, and I would certainly hope that we could get that worked into the budget and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| I mean, when we look at pushing it out a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| what we're doing is we're increasing the projected capital debt for those out years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| I just want to – I agree with the need to roll it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| I also want to make sure that it's a priority to get back in this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Thank you, Madam Chair. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| Barely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| All right. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Yes, yes, we can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| Are you able to hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Yes, yes, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| Okay, okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| I just wanted to point out that I've literally been on the phone with Mr. Oaks many, many times regarding the purchase of the property for the Farragut Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3923)|
| 1:05:34| And like other things that we've experienced with slowdowns in various services, that's also been the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3934)|
| 1:05:46| So, I just wanted to make note of that, that that's been a much slower process than we were expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| And that's going to push that time frame out for that school, which is difficult for the Farragut schools because they are so overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3953)|
| 1:06:02| But I'm thankful that we can, we have, that we are currently working on that and look forward to being able to move forward on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3962)|
| 1:06:10| So, thank you, Mr. Oaks, for the time and energy on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| Yes, ma'am, and I'd just like to share a little information on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| We've been in the process of locating a piece of property this year and doing our due diligence on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| And we are fast approaching the end of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| As a matter of fact, the property owner and his attorney are reviewing our draft sales document at this point, or purchase agreement at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=3998)|
| 1:06:50| So, we think it's possible we may be able to bring a contract for the purchase of about 25 acres to the board next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4010)|
| 1:07:02| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you. Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| So, we have a motion by Mr. McMillan and a second by Miss Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| Ms. Cook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4034)|
| 1:07:22| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| And Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| That's nine yes votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Item nine, approve the fiscal year 2023 school nutrition fund budget at the major category level for $27,855,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4062)|
| 1:07:54| So, a motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Miss Satterfield. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4074)|
| 1:08:00| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| I just want to highlight something in the food service budget for our community and for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| So, I know the recommendation is that we increase salary for food service personnel by 15%, which I think is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4092)|
| 1:08:22| I think sometimes that our food service department actually doesn't get talked about as much as some of our other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| Even in some of the things that I've read this week out in the media, you know, there was a talk of a 4% increase for our certifieds and 8% for our custodial and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4109)|
| 1:08:37| but I didn't read any mention of our food service folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| And we all know that food service, just out in the market, is paying more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4120)|
| 1:08:48| You know, my son last year got his first job at Yasin's starting at $12 an hour as a 16-year-old, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| And so, currently our base is $8.65 for worker and food service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| And even at 15%, we're talking about raising that $1.35 at the base, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| And I appreciate Brett and her team and others working on this, especially when our revenue sources are very different for food service from others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4146)|
| 1:09:15| I also want to make note that that position, you know, it's only a six-hour per day position, typically 177 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4155)|
| 1:09:24| It's an interesting type of position to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220427-special-called-fy-2023-budget?start=4164)|
