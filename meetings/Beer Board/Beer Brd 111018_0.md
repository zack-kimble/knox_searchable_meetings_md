| 0:03:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=217)|

| 0:03:40| If you'll see Ms. State, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| Exotic Nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Good evening, my name is Carlos Ponce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=227)|
| 0:03:57| Our is Exotic Nightclub, 315 Mohican Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Mr. Ponce was actually issued a citation at his new business on October 1st that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| not been adjudicated yet for violation of the Brown Bagging Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| Mr. Swanson, would that prohibit or would that be one of the issues that would perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=256)|
| 0:04:26| prohibit him from receiving a beer permit if convicted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Arguably it would because it is an offense involving alcohol and the serving of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| Do we know when this would go to court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Yes, it's set for city court on November 10th at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| I'd like to make a motion that we postpone this until November 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Discussion on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Hold on one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| If you'd like to speak, go ahead, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| Could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Yes, my name is Lon, L-O-N, Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| I am the president of Brown Hazen House Interiors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| We're located at 5115 Humber Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| We're in the southeast corner of the building that they're wanting to get the beer license for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| And I want everybody to have good business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| But let me tell you the experience that I had Saturday morning when I went to my studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| There was more garbage than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| In the parking lot where we normally park, next to the dumpster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| there was a torn knit shirt that appeared to be a t-shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| And, excuse me, but beside it was a used condom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| Later, we found, in addition to all the additional trash, a used feminine hygiene product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=355)|
| 0:06:04| I have the pictures. I know it's very disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| But I think you need to take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| This kind of activity has not happened down there in the last five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| And just since these people have come, it is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| And we're not, none of the neighbors are happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Okay. Okay, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| And you're welcome to enter into the record anything that you, if you want to bring it up, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| And I assure you, we take this very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| I mean, this board, just in the three applicants that we've, you know, we take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=396)|
| 0:06:45| Absolutely, trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| What if it had been in your driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| There has been, there has been a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| And is there a further, excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| I just want to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| I'm Kaylee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Kaylee Bowitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| My address of my business, Paper Paraphernalia, is 4921 Homburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| As a long-time merchant in the Bearden area, this is, it's really disturbing to have this type of clientele| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=427)|
| 0:07:19| around all of our businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| And I hope that the board will seriously consider denying the Exotic Dance Club their beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=443)|
| 0:07:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| And I'm sorry I didn't recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| I thought you all were together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| But duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Mr. Swanson, would you explain to all of us and to the public what grounds we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| to not permit someone to have a beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| Well, obviously the things that are contained in the application have to be fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=469)|
| 0:07:57| But in addition to that, section 4-37 of the city code says that no person shall be, no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| permittee shall be a person who has been convicted of any violation of any ordinance related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| to the possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of beer, or convicted of any violation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| the laws against possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of alcoholic beverages or beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| or any crime involving moral turpitude within the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| So those are the bases in addition to the various qualifications contained within the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| Those are the qualifications upon which a permit could be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| If an applicant fulfills all of those requirements, an applicant is entitled to a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| and may not be denied a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| As far as an establishment like this going into that particular neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| that what we really need to look at is how neighbors react to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| and the responsibility of being a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| I mean, we have laws against maintaining of dirty lots and all of those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| but they do not serve as disqualifying factors with regard to the issuance of a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| I just wanted to make sure that that was clear in terms of what we can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| I think this is the one that came up that I opposed at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| because it didn't meet the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Having said that, they've applied for and received a state liquor permit license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| So I just wanted to state that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| I know a lot of people are interested in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| But I'll support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Not all those in favor of the deferral until the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| I'm not sure if they had something else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=607)|
| 0:10:18| So we've been postponed for the next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| If you'll be here the 15th, November the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Or based on the liquor license approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| For beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| For your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| You're going to need to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| But he identified himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| In the time between now and the next beer permit application meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| you're going to need to resolve this issue of the charge about the brown bagging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| And arguably, if the permittee is convicted of that charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| that might be a disqualifying factor to obtain a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| So you need to pay attention to that and deal with it in some appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| Mr. Chairman, who was the other person that spoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=662)|

| 0:20:07| We're waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| We were informed we didn't need the health department approval because we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| dairy or a refrigerator. Well, that's up to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| We just need to see that statement. Okay, well, we'll get that to you. ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| We're all over it. That's the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Move to approve. Append and final documentation. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| All right, councilman? Yeah, there's a note in the back, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| it answers the question, but I'm just curious with Mr. Swanson, what is the rule if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| an off-premise application, we don't apply the 50 feet, not the 300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| Okay, well, thanks. I might learn this eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| There's been a motion and a second. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| If not, all those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| Thank you very much. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Trader Joe's, number 663. How did I know that you were going to be with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| Trader Joe's? Good evening. My name is John Ebbing. I'm from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| 2132 Branch Oak Trail in Nashville, Tennessee. Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| No record. Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| We're waiting on approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| Move to approve, pending final documentation. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| I would assume that you would probably, since that's in the second district, maybe want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| to hear a little bit about Trader Joe's. I was just going to say, I want to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| about this. Tell us a little bit about Trader Joe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| We're a unique grocery store that's been in business for 54 years. Started in Southern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| California, and we've come across the nation in the last 15 years. It's our second store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| in Tennessee. I'm currently the manager of the Nashville store, and we hope to open early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| next year over on Kingston Pike. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| We sell shirts, too? We don't sell shirts. We wear these as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| uniforms. Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| I've got on my bright orange one for Knoxville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| That's appropriate. I just know Knoxville's very, you know, we're just tickled to death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| to be a chosen city, because I know that doesn't come very easily, and we welcome you with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| open arms, and appreciate you making us a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Thank you very much. We're glad to be here. You're welcome. So all those in favor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| motion, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| Okay. Up in smoke. I'm Deanne Selvidge, 4909 Millertown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1355)|
| 0:22:49| 37917. No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| We're waiting on approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Oh, excuse me. Surrender the former beer permit. I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| It's 4th District. Yes, I'll move to approve pending the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| documentation. I was going to say, okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| Discussion on the motion? Not all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Aye. I actually had a question about the former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| beer permit. Since it's a new business, he moved out. We didn't buy his business. Does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| he have to surrender his permit before we can get it? Okay. Another question. He's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| noncompliant. He's very belligerent. How do we deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Call us. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Call us. Okay. Thank you. Are we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| You're done. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Woodsmith, Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1430)|
| 0:24:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Mukesh Redd, 2240 Woodsmith Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| We're waiting for approval from the fire inspector, and we need the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| It's 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| I see the task program has not been completed. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| That might be an error on my part. I believe it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Yes, they've been to task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Okay, I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Yes, can I ask a question of the gentleman at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| It says that Woodsmith Market and Deli is surrendering a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Did you change the ownership of the business or something? Is that what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| No, we are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| Okay. I was wondering why do we have a surrender and then a reissuance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| Same ownership and you're just continuing on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Yes, we are continuing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Is there a reason why the current permit is not in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| Why would you get a new permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Actually, I missed the meeting last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| I was sick and my partner was out of town, so we missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| Other time, I think so, like fire and health and everything is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| We have been approved for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| But it's new ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Yes, it's a new ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you so much. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| There's been a motion and I second it to pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Organized play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1549)|
| 0:25:59| Pleasure to see you again, Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| My name is Morgan Hardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| My business address is 131 South Central Street, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Personal address is 820 North 4th Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| I'm approaching here tonight to request an additional 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| We've made good progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| However, we had to make significant alterations, including had to take the work that was being done at one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| and completely redo it, switch the bathrooms twice over the course of having to do the alterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| to the building to be in compliance with the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| As I'm working through my landlord, who's working with the county and getting feedback through several loops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| that has to have work done in an ongoing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| It's been a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| But we did finally get the plumbing inspector in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| He's finally approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I believe that's the last step before we can have the building inspector come in and issue the certificate of occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| and probably do the approval at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| The request has been for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| That's the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| I move to approve that request for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| To extend it for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| I thought you were going to pull the trigger there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| So proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| All those in favor of the extension say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Peter Kern Bar, they're out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| They have asked for another 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| I think it's the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| They've had some, you know, building and what have you, just construction issues that they need to overcome there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| So they have asked for an additional 60 days, and that would be the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| I move for extension of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| No discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Is there any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| No further what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Big Tiny, she was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| She was just slow getting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| No further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Maybe this is a question directed over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| I find that on a lot of these that we've approved pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| are we having trouble with the codes people setting up times to meet with these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| or is it their problem that they haven't gotten in touch with the codes people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| I know the codes people right now are short on people, but it seems like a majority of these are all pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| And so I'm curious as to are we having a scheduling problem, a manpower problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| I don't know that it has been a codes issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| It has been usually just getting the inspections from the fire inspector and health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| and the building inspector at times scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| And I'm not aware of there being a serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| We just don't release it without the final documentation in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| Is it the responsibility of the bureau of permittee to set that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| It is the responsibility of the applicant to set it up, but we provide them with all the contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| And I will say that it's our experience that those inspectors cooperate with us in every way they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| And, Councilman, historically it's been that way for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| I don't know it's ever been any different from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Just a whole series of things, I'm sure, play into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Then I have one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| I have one other thing also then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| As far as the tin roof and the La Rumba Club, we are going to invite them to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1774)|
| 0:29:46| That's under consideration, yes, at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1786)|

| 0:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| A number of the neighbors in the area have asked what our next step is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| And I've heard complaints on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| And we'll finalize those plans in the very, very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd111018?start=1811)|
