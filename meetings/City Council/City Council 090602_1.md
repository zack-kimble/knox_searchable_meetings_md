| 2:06:07| and make a change in an area of the city that needs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| that we've invested a huge amount of money in before in five points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| And it feels like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| If we get the grant, we've put an extra million into an $80 million project that is going to be concrete stuff on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7577)|
| 2:06:26| It's going to be housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| It's going to be streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| It's going to be lights, sewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| And if we don't, we haven't spent anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| So I think this is a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| I understand where you're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| but could we have the same effect of a resolution of commitment upon if we were having our application approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7600)|
| 2:06:49| that the city would do that without going through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| and maybe getting a rain check later or getting our money back, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7614)|
| 2:07:00| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| Councilman Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| I'd like to follow up with Mr. Martin on his concept that an 11th hour, I guess, amendment of capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7626)|
| 2:07:16| or addition to capital kind of gives short shrift to other projects that we were unable to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7636)|
| 2:07:25| And I guess I'm wondering if there's any that come to mind that you're willing to talk about that were significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7645)|
| 2:07:32| that we might have liked to have done this year and were unable to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| And the second part of my question is I know we heard at our midyear budget retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| and we heard again throughout the presentation of the budget that this year was tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7661)|
| 2:07:46| but next year is going to be tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| And I'm wondering what you're projecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| We already have an $800,000 commitment toward this HOPE VI project in next year's capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7670)|
| 2:07:57| And, you know, you pointed out that this year's budget capital dollars have shrunk by almost a third, I guess, about a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7677)|
| 2:08:05| Roughly $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| And so, you know, where do you foresee the capital plan being next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7687)|
| 2:08:12| Well, if you look at what makes up the $27 million, you'll find quickly a large number that's in engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7692)|
| 2:08:19| which is $13 million, which is infrastructure, includes paving, those sort of things, very traditional things that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7699)|
| 2:08:27| Those needs never go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| We could always make an argument that we could pave more streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| We put what we thought was a reasonable amount consistent with what we've been able to do in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| And Mr. York, the finance director, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| We probably had in requests $50 million or so of different capital budget requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7725)|
| 2:08:53| For me, I would hesitate to cite one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| Sort of like naming people, you would leave somebody out that might actually be a more worthy cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7735)|
| 2:09:02| But we really spend a great deal of time scrutinizing every capital request that we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7742)|
| 2:09:10| looking at the merits of that, the payback of that, and our consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7750)|
| 2:09:17| and the service levels and the things that we're committed to to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| And we think that what we have proposed is good and that it is appropriate for us to be supportive of Rattrapi Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| We want nothing more than for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| And we felt good that we had been able to figure out a way to fund exactly what they asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7770)|
| 2:09:38| It did cause other things not to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| I mean, that's the reality of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| But we felt good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| We were reluctant to propose to you a budget that would have us invade our fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7786)|
| 2:09:54| given the uncertain times that we were in today and the uncertainty that we face in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| That 10-11 budget will be more challenging than what we had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| And that will be when we will be very glad that we have the kind of fund that you all have been supportive of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7805)|
| 2:10:11| and have made possible the kind of fund balance that we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| And having thought about it a little bit, I actually feel comfortable doing what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7816)|
| 2:10:21| I understand it would be better for the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| I feel okay about leaving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| And who knows what the revenue situation could look like next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7824)|
| 2:10:29| And that's why I feel good having that little buffer that we do and that fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| So having thought about what I understand, and I do appreciate that this is a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| It will really, really change the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| I'm convinced of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| But I feel comfortable with what we're putting into this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| and personally would recommend leaving the fund balance where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| But it is a hard, it's not a totally out of, you know, it's not a totally Becker's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7845)|
| 2:10:58| Anyway, that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| Anybody else counsel on those or any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| We're in general discussion on the budget at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| I just want to make certain there wasn't anything else on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7869)|
| 2:11:10| There's a motion on the floor to amend to take a million out of fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| to apply toward the Walter P. Taylor project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| I'm going to withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| I just did that for discussion purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7882)|
| 2:11:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| Thank you, Captain Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7891)|
| 2:11:32| I have a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| This is not a million-dollar payment in advance of the, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| taking some of that money that we've already committed down the road and accelerating that payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| This is adding to the commitment in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| Dan, do you want to make sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| That's a great, that is actually a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| So that's a good point to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| First of all, let me say that we're happy with the city's commitment for the $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| We felt like that was a minimum that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| But I was asked the question if another million would make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| And, of course, you know, the more the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| But we're happy with the $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| So, Mr. Becker, are you proposing putting $1.8 million on the table this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7933)|
| 2:12:18| within the $8 million that we've already committed in the CIP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| Or are you upping the CIP to nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| My sense is we're upping the CIP to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| We're upping the commitment the city is making to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| Over the total period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| And my sense is if we're pulling it from fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| it doesn't make much difference if we do it $100,000 a year or a million at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| So doing it simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| There was a second by Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| Any other conversation on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| Ready to vote, then, on that motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7970)|
| 2:12:51| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| Whoa, better do roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| Councilman Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7980)|
| 2:13:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7984)|
| 2:13:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7985)|
| 2:13:06| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7986)|
| 2:13:13| This is not a good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7993)|
| 2:13:17| Well, I feel like I just have to say no, but I want to say yes, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| Final answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| Move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| Councilman Whithull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| I heard four ayes and five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8019)|
| 2:13:40| The final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8020)|
| 2:13:41| I said I had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| Final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8022)|
| 2:13:43| Thanks, everybody, for the serious discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| I really do appreciate how this council, in one level, some of these things feel very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| you know, I love the fact that there's so much money in the fund balance and knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| that this council will seriously think about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| And, frankly, if it is a Becker idea, this council won't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| So, you know, that makes me feel confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| Last thing that I feel real strongly about is the zoning inspector for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8043)|
| 2:14:10| We talked a little bit about this yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| Now that we've got some freed up time from building inspectors, we've had a massive increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| in the number of zoning inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| That says to me those violations are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| We're hearing that from neighborhood people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| And when those building inspectors are going back to doing their jobs, when things do pick up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| we're going to be missing things unless we have some way to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| So what I want to do is move $50,000 into the city inspection funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8073)|
| 2:14:40| And I think what we have to do is actually recommend that the city use that to hire another zoning inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| But I think we've got a good relationship with the administration and we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| The challenge becomes what's the other side of that equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| Where does the money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| And this is one I'm going to just say real honestly is I thought about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| I thought there would be some great ways to do this of looking at some capital project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| that we just say we'll put it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| But then we start this discussion about recurring, non-recurring that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| And I don't want to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| There's also a sense of politically, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| do I do something on that end that actually gains support for what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| So I'm actually going to suggest that we pull this money from the Knoxville Chamber Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8118)|
| 2:15:24| and move it into a zoning inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| And that was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| Ms. Roddy, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| My light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| I'd like to call on I believe I have the right department, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8141)|
| 2:15:46| in terms of our permitting department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| That's with you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8153)|
| 2:15:54| I acknowledge, Vice Mayor Becker, that zoning inspections are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| And I acknowledge that we have violations that we are unable to address with our current staffing levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8159)|
| 2:16:05| However, I don't foresee a huge uptick in the workload of our current zoning staff next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8165)|
| 2:16:17| And where I want to call on Mr. King for this is what we've heard in the budget is our permitting is down significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8177)|
| 2:16:24| and there will be a lag in that next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| And so it would seem to me, and I'd like you to tell me right or wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8188)|
| 2:16:33| it would seem to me that next year the zoning inspectors that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| assuming that no one retires and we have the same number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| would still have some extra time, if not more time next year, due to that permitting lag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8201)|
| 2:16:48| And if that's so, then to me that would say that this would not be the time to add that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| Maybe that's something we want to bring to the table next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8212)|
| 2:16:56| Let me first of all say I appreciate Vice Mayor Becker thinking of inspectors and zoning inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8216)|
| 2:17:04| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| But let me also say that, you know, revenues are down, as you recall from the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8226)|
| 2:17:13| I think Mr. York and I both feel like we're going to come in approximately $300,000 below our projection on the building inspection revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8233)|
| 2:17:24| But what we have done isn't so much the result of decreased revenues and decreased permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8244)|
| 2:17:31| We've made a change in the way we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| We have utilized building inspectors to do more than the standard inspections that we have done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8255)|
| 2:17:44| And we have been able to increase the number of zoning inspections by cross-training people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8264)|
| 2:17:51| So we think that we have made a solution to the problem without adding an additional personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8271)|
| 2:18:01| Mr. Norman and I both have made no recommendation to Mr. Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| or the mayor that we hire additional inspectors at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| As a matter of fact, we have taken it upon ourselves to freeze one position in that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8289)|
| 2:18:16| because we did this last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| We didn't want to have to lay anybody off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| So we are monitoring those revenues very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| And I can honestly say I feel good about where we are with zoning inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| Well, and I feel good about the fact that the City of Knoxville has not had to lay anyone off in these times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| And I applaud the kind of cross-training that's happened in your department to allow folks to continue to be able to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8316)|
| 2:18:43| Later on when the economy picks up, you know, we will have an opportunity to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| And if we think we can't keep up with the level of inspections that we're currently doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8328)|
| 2:18:54| then maybe we need to revisit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| But I think we're okay right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| Dr. Wood, do I have my second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| Now we're not discussing anymore unless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8348)|
| 2:19:13| Going, going, gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8353)|
| 2:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| I'm just happy the vice mayor doesn't have a dog he has to go home and feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| We're wishing he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8364)|
| 2:19:25| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Well, I just wanted to ask a question about response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| What do you feel is your average response time to a call asking for an inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8375)|
| 2:19:45| And I guess I'm thinking zoning inspections now more than I am building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| Although you could respond on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8390)|
| 2:19:53| Well, I don't have that data in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| I did have it at the budget hearing, but I did not bring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| I can provide that to council tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| But I'm sorry I don't have that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| I understand Vice Mayor Becker's request because that's been an issue that's been brought before us many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8406)|
| 2:20:15| And in the past, you know, I think there was a tremendous lag time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| and inability to meet all of the requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| Well, I would credit Mr. Norman with the idea to do this cross-training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| and I really think it will work and look forward to the feedback from council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| if you have issues that you don't think we are covering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| Is that cross-training done or to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| It is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| That was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8438)|
| 2:20:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8439)|
| 2:20:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| Yeah, I guess we've got one more amendment, which is the administration amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| And I don't know if I actually need to read these numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| or can just say the amendment that's reflected on this piece of paper we have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8449)|
| 2:20:55| I will so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| That's not one of your cockamamie ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| No, it's one of the administration's cockamamie ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| How does that sound?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8462)|
| 2:21:03| Which is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| It's a Haslam, not a Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| It's a good thing we consider the ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| I need a second really badly now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| Jim, you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| If I may, the amendments proposed are not an administration proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| They come from the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| These are for funds that are funded by federal grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| And when we did the budget, we made assumptions on what numbers we would receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8487)|
| 2:21:34| We've since now got the final numbers, and we're just trying to plug into the final numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8494)|
| 2:21:39| So these are from the federal government then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| So this is President Obama's cockamamie idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8504)|
| 2:21:45| Brilliant idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| Yes, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| So any other comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| Ready to vote then on that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8516)|
| 2:21:57| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8518)|
| 2:21:59| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| Mr. King has the answer that Ms. Peele was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| Councilman Roddy had the information from the handout from the, I think it was actually from the mayor's budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8529)|
| 2:22:17| And it looks like the average response time is three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8537)|
| 2:22:20| That's what I had recalled, but I didn't remember from when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| Thank you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8548)|

| 2:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8556)|

| 2:24:15| Ms. Riley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| On the final page of this ordinance packet is a memo from MPC and it references zoo renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8657)|
| 2:24:24| and I believe this is incorrect and I realize this doesn't actually affect the legality of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| but I wanted to point out that the MPC memo in giving highlights of this year's capital improvement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| indicates that this appropriation will represent the remaining obligation of the city's pledge to the zoo's capital campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| My understanding, Mr. Martin or Mr. York, is that the remaining obligation was actually divided between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8679)|
| 2:24:46| was delayed somewhat and divided between this year and next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| This would, we split the remaining obligation half this year and half to come in 10 and 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8689)|
| 2:24:57| So the intent of the city is to honor that obligation full but to pay it forward some of it next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| And this memo from MPC would be incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8707)|

| 2:26:13| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8777)|
| 2:26:18| Oh, better back up on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| We'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| Mr. Frost now wants to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8782)|
| 2:26:23| Well, simply because I thought there was some email from the League of Women Voters saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8783)|
| 2:26:29| they were thinking this was going to get postponed tonight because of the uncertainty of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| head of the election, the election administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| So, I was expecting not a move to approve based on an email I received from someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8796)|
| 2:26:42| with the League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8802)|
| 2:26:43| Mr. Sauer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8803)|
| 2:26:47| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| You know, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| I had thought at one point that it would make sense to postpone this because of the Election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8810)|
| 2:26:56| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| I have never heard anybody else other than myself raise that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| So, I figured I was mistaken about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| If Council wants to postpone this, they're more than willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| I, you know, I figured people wanted to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| Mayor, you know, I would be in favor of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| I mean, I could almost flip a coin at this point on which way I would vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| But I really do want to go through some sort of a public process, a more public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8841)|
| 2:27:28| I know we've had a couple of meetings, but I've yet to have heard from one side of the equation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| And I think there's kind of a sleeping majority of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8854)|
| 2:27:38| I don't know that, but I just feel more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| I'd hope Greg McKay could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| I wanted to get a little bit more into the costs of what this will initially cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| and what it might save in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| And secondly, about the actual voting locations themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| So, I'm in favor of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| I saw Ms. Roddy's light next, and I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| I guess my comments are to address the motion to postpone, but we don't have that on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| So, I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| I'm going to move to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8889)|
| 2:28:10| Now it's moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8890)|
| 2:28:11| Discussing on postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| If the reason for postponement has to do with the uncertainty that Mr. Frost referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8895)|
| 2:28:21| in the administration of the Election Commission, I would refute that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| I think we have heard some excellent testimony about convenience voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| and whether or not it's something that any council member supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| I think that the discussion of convenience voting is outside of the election administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8912)|
| 2:28:38| I'm quite confident that the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| and the administrator would be quite capable of carrying out any process of city elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| that we would indicate that we wanted, whether it was convenience voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| or the hybrid system that we have now of early voting plus precinct election day voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8929)|
| 2:28:54| So, I think that is not a reason to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8934)|
| 2:28:58| Councilman Hilchrist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| Well, actually I had my light on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| I made a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| I'll stay with that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| Well, my reason for actually needing a postponement, we had the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8947)|
| 2:29:14| I stated my reasons for wanting some better information before I had to make a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8954)|
| 2:29:20| And, frankly, that information has not been forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| Nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| Mr. McKay isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| Last evening in the public forum that we had, certainly those questions were not answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8968)|
| 2:29:37| But I did feel that in some private discussions I had with people who came to me after the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8977)|
| 2:29:44| that there was some interest in what the concerns were of some of the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| But it has nothing to do with the Election Commission director itself at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8989)|
| 2:29:56| It has to do with better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| And I have expressed what those concerns are, both last night and to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=8998)|
| 2:30:04| So I feel that that information or that consideration may be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9004)|
| 2:30:10| And if it is, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| If it isn't, that will tell me how I definitely want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| I guess a couple thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| One, the postponement, I think, is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| I'm a little worried, Mr. Horquist, about the timing of four weeks as opposed to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| And my worry just gets to be we've got an election coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| And while I don't think it makes a difference for folks that are going to choose to run or not on June 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9031)|
| 2:30:39| at some level it feels like I don't want people getting too far into campaigning before they know how the vote is going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9039)|
| 2:30:48| So I'd actually ask you to make a change to make it a two-week as opposed to a four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9048)|
| 2:30:54| Is that, Mr. Swanson, is that a motion I can actually make to change it to a four-week postponement to a two-week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9054)|
| 2:31:02| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| There's a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| You can offer a substitute motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| So, yes, you can offer a substitute motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| It will have to have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| Offer a substitute motion that it be postponed to eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9072)|
| 2:31:17| I believe I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| Actually, I think probably he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| If he does not get a second or doesn't win, I'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| I guess I'll make that motion in a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| And I don't feel strongly, but I think it does make a little more sense to move this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| And I guess the other thing I'd love to hear about is this continuing sense of we need public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| And we've had two public hearings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| It's been on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9100)|
| 2:31:41| It's been in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| It's been on radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9102)|
| 2:31:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| Joe, I think you might be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| There might be a large mass of people out there that we're not hearing from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| And I don't know what we do to get more people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9110)|
| 2:31:54| And I'd love to hear some ideas on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| So I'll go ahead and offer what I hope is a friendly motion to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| to substitute a two-week postponement for the four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9122)|
| 2:32:06| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9126)|
| 2:32:10| Okay, that motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| I think I saw what would have been Councilman Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| I don't think I've called on you yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| Well, you know, initially when you called the vote, I voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9139)|
| 2:32:24| But actually I do have some concerns, and I expressed them to Ms. McGee-Stewart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9144)|
| 2:32:30| and the other gentleman with the election commission that was here last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| And that's the fact that I could be more supportive of this idea because I have heard from lots of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9155)|
| 2:32:42| Several candidates that actually are supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| I just feel like the locations of these voting centers are just so skewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9166)|
| 2:32:51| There is, other than New Harvest Park, there's really not one on the other side of 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9171)|
| 2:32:59| And I would like to see one be in each council district if this thing does move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9179)|
| 2:33:05| And I've expressed that to members of the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9185)|
| 2:33:10| But other than that, you know, I've heard from people on both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| But, I mean, it's a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| It's a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| It's just a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9198)|
| 2:33:20| And, you know, give it a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| Back to Vice Mayor Becker's statement about an election coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9207)|
| 2:33:33| It is in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9213)|
| 2:33:38| I'm not sure I was looking for the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9218)|
| 2:33:40| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9224)|
| 2:33:45| It's September 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| So, you know, that's late September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| That's a long ways off still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| I mean, it's not a long ways if you're campaigning, but I just don't think that's material to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9232)|
| 2:33:58| I'm sort of interested in Mr. Booker's motion, but I stuck with mine because I made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9238)|
| 2:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9246)|
| 2:34:07| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9249)|
| 2:34:10| First of all, in response to Councilman Hall's concern about the location of the centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9250)|
| 2:34:15| I don't feel that approving a pilot project for convenience voting necessarily endorses a draft map that we saw of locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9255)|
| 2:34:24| As a matter of fact, the language in the resolution indicates that the Election Commission would then approve locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9264)|
| 2:34:30| that were appropriate given the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| So I would hope that we would have some input there in terms of their meetings being open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| Again, I don't feel like approving this resolution tonight puts a stamp of approval on that particular map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| Secondly, I have a little bit of a concern in response to the Vice Mayor's comment about additional public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9283)|
| 2:34:51| In terms of it looking like Council is trying, you said, how do we reach those other people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9291)|
| 2:34:57| Well, I think we've had a very well-publicized effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9297)|
| 2:35:02| I think we had a packed room at our City Council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| We had a number of folks who chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| We said after that event that we wanted to have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| We conducted that last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9312)|
| 2:35:14| I don't want to give the impression on this particular issue that we are somehow going out and searching for a minority or a majority that's not present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9314)|
| 2:35:23| because we've certainly had a lot of very divisive, difficult issues to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9323)|
| 2:35:29| And there's something skewed about saying, gosh, haven't heard from the side I wanted to hear from yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| so we're going to have one more hearing so that we can make sure those people come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| When we've had two public forums, it's been in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| All of us have received e-mails on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| I think it is irresponsible to our process to say we're going to have one more hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9345)|
| 2:35:49| in hopes that we hear from that other side that we haven't heard from yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| Mr. Roddy, I'm sure those of us who have a different sense of this feel quite chastised by your comments and, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9357)|
| 2:36:05| But I think you prejudged the reason that we might have for feeling that we haven't heard from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9365)|
| 2:36:13| So I'm just telling you how it feels on this side of the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9373)|
| 2:36:19| But, you know, it concerns me because obviously I received the e-mail that was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9379)|
| 2:36:28| I know why the people stacked the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| It was a stacked deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| I hate to say that, but it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| Then subsequently received another e-mail to the same people, and I was included because things I've been involved in in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9396)|
| 2:36:46| So that's where folks came from last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9406)|
| 2:36:50| Now, as far as the public is concerned, we tacked that on to a workshop that people may or may not have been interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9410)|
| 2:36:57| And I just feel that it would be interesting to have the opportunity to hear more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9417)|
| 2:37:04| But what concerns me is for those of us who expressed some interest in having better information about where those voting precincts were going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9424)|
| 2:37:15| And I have to agree with Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| When I looked at that map, immediately I wasn't comfortable with those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9438)|
| 2:37:24| And making sure, this is a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9444)|
| 2:37:28| It's a very important election for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| And it's very important that everyone can access a convenient place to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| And I just don't want anyone to feel that they have been, that their opportunity to vote has been diminished by the fact that they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9457)|
| 2:37:47| something that is convenient for them and where they feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| So I would hope that the Election Commission could give us a little bit of a sense that they want to respond to our questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9470)|
| 2:37:58| and to our concern for the voters, my concerns for the voters, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9478)|
| 2:38:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| There are too many people like me who don't do e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9490)|
| 2:38:15| And that's probably why we didn't see some of those that Councilman Becker and I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9495)|
| 2:38:21| Councilman Pelos stole my thunder when she said it wasn't a packed room but a stacked room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9501)|
| 2:38:27| And that's exactly what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| And I really resent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| Councilman Bailey, and then I'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| You know, it is a very, very, very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| And I'm out here in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| And I called people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9522)|
| 2:38:43| And I said, well, how do you feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9523)|
| 2:38:46| They don't even know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| You know, and I just don't think that you do something like this until you have a feeling about how people feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9528)|
| 2:38:55| And as I said in one of the workshops, people have done this the same way for 30, 40, 50, 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9535)|
| 2:39:02| And I just want to be comfortable that people are going to know how they can go vote and where they can go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9542)|
| 2:39:09| I don't see this as a Republican thing or a Democratic thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| I don't think it ñ I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| But that's why I'm not ñ I'd like to see it postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| I'm just ñ there's just too many ñ this is just too important of an issue to just rush into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9558)|
| 2:39:26| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| I guess a couple of thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| I think, you know, postponement is a fine idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| We're ñ you know, clearly there's some questions that need answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| I guess the question I raised in response to Ms. Roddy is sort of how do we get more people there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9576)|
| 2:39:41| Because I ñ we have had two workshops on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| We have heard from way more people on this than we did on the budget we just adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9583)|
| 2:39:47| And, frankly, I don't know if anybody's going to say the people who spoke to us on the budget weren't a stack deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| And, frankly, I don't know that there's any issue that we've ever come to that you couldn't argue was stacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9592)|
| 2:39:58| So if ñ I'm quite willing to schedule another public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9598)|
| 2:40:03| And, you know, we can schedule that with Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| We can schedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| What I want to make sure is that we do something to make sure that we do hear from the people that folks on my side of the table are indicating we're not hearing from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9608)|
| 2:40:15| Because I don't know what else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| It's been on the radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| It's been on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9618)|
| 2:40:19| It's been on the web.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| It's been in the front page of the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| I'm not sure what else we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| And as far as, you know, people who don't know about it, Mr. Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| there are people who don't know who Bill Haslam is who live in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| Yeah, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| Well, you know, when we had the workshop, I had an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| And when I mentioned a public hearing, I really felt the Election Commission was going to schedule that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9638)|
| 2:40:47| and that they were going to advertise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| And then it doesn't involve us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9649)|
| 2:40:52| And it doesn't involve either party or, you know, a specialized group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| I felt that, and I think we discussed it that evening, that it was their responsibility to have their plan, lay it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9658)|
| 2:41:07| let people know how it was going to work so they could then contact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| And that's how I expected a public discussion to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9671)|
| 2:41:17| And, of course, I had to leave that meeting early, regrettably, for a personal reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9677)|
| 2:41:23| It was very important to our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| But it was my expectation that the Election Commission was going to arrange for good community education on the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9685)|
| 2:41:34| before we had to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| So that's one way I would suggest that we can get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| I agree with Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| You know, we have workshops, and there are people that follow what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9707)|
| 2:41:53| And then there are the vast majority of people that don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| And I think this is an issue that rises to the level that we need to take it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9718)|
| 2:42:04| They don't need to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| And I think it's, you know, an Election Commission issue that we need to go out to all parts of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9726)|
| 2:42:15| and advertise that we're considering doing this, something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9735)|
| 2:42:20| Now, some may say this is not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| This is a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9742)|
| 2:42:23| Let's try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| We may be going down a path we don't want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| I just think it's a very, very important issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| and I'm going to caution on the side of taking a little time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9749)|
| 2:42:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| I agree with Mr. Bailey that this is a very important issue, and it should not be given short shrift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9761)|
| 2:42:47| However, I think if someone feels that this issue needs to be taken to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9767)|
| 2:42:53| to those who are not paying attention to this, then that is the job of the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9773)|
| 2:42:58| I think it's irresponsible of us, again, to take a specific issue, a narrow issue, no matter what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9778)|
| 2:43:05| and no matter what side you fall on it, and suddenly begin to publicize and market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9785)|
| 2:43:12| and advertise that issue by going forward with more effort than we have done with any other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| I think Mr. Becker's comment was accurate, that all workshops, all council meetings are stacked to a certain extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9798)|
| 2:43:27| by folks who feel that they have a particular interest in that arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9807)|
| 2:43:34| I remember when I first came on council and we had a workshop about Austin Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| Well, the only folks that we heard from that night, and it was a very long workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| were folks who were very polarized on one side of that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| And yet we didn't go out and try to seek the folks who felt differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| And certainly there were citizens that did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| And I think we can, if we postpone this, then I think we toss the ball to the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| and we ask them to take more responsibility for the publicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| But I think it's irresponsible for us to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9839)|
| 2:44:04| Counselor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| The people who came here tonight with disabilities were people who had similar problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9845)|
| 2:44:12| The people who came to talk about Austin Homes were people who lived in Austin Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| concerned about their living situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| The people who came to us in those two meetings worked for the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9862)|
| 2:44:29| They were poll workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| They were office workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| That is the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9872)|
| 2:44:34| It was a stacked room of employees who came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9874)|
| 2:44:39| And that's the difference in Austin Homes people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| and the people who came tonight who had disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9882)|
| 2:44:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| Let's maybe push this toward conclusion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| Right now the motion on the floor is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| Let me say something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| We actually had a quick little voice vote, and then I said, well, let's go back and poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| So I'm going to by acclamation unless somebody stops me say that we agree that that vote was not applicable or official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9899)|
| 2:45:08| or whatever unless somebody disagrees or wants to challenge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9908)|
| 2:45:12| So the discussion we're having now is the one about postponement is the one that's applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9912)|
| 2:45:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9918)|
| 2:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9919)|
| 2:45:20| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9920)|
| 2:45:21| Then the vote is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9921)|
| 2:45:22| The motion is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=9922)|

| 2:51:29| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10289)|
| 2:51:30| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| I know Mr. Wetzel called me and I didn't get to call him back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| Mr. Dewhurst is here, too, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10294)|
| 2:51:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10297)|
| 2:51:38| I just want to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10298)|
| 2:51:39| Normally with the city there's a good but-for analysis that says we need this money to make this project happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10299)|
| 2:51:47| I'm assuming that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| And I guess I just want to say there's a point in my mind where if you had asked me two weeks ago about downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10308)|
| 2:51:54| I would have said, oh, we don't need to do TIFs for downtown anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| And I don't want to have a long discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| but I just want to make sure you all did a good analysis of the but-for, that this would not happen without the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10319)|
| 2:52:07| We did that analysis internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| and we also sent out to a bank for a third-party independent review that said this project is going to be tough to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10329)|
| 2:52:15| even with this financing in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10337)|
| 2:52:18| I assume that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10338)|
| 2:52:19| It's good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10339)|

| 2:53:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| 12-B is an ordinance enacted pursuant to TCA 675705| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10391)|
| 2:53:14| to implement a property tax freeze program for elderly low-income taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10394)|
| 2:53:19| requested by Councilmember Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| Real briefly, as Mr. York comes to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| this is actually one of Mr. Hahn's ideas that was pushing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10403)|
| 2:53:29| Mr. York will speak to this in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| and thanks to the help of MTAS and our own Cindy Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| they were able to track down local governments in the State of Tennessee who have enacted this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10415)|
| 2:53:41| but none of them have actually had to apply this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10421)|
| 2:53:46| So, as I said before, we don't really want to be the guinea pig in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10426)|
| 2:53:51| We would like to learn from others versus losing on the front end on how this should operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10431)|
| 2:53:57| Obviously, there is no property tax increase in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| and Mr. York has some other ideas why this should not be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10441)|
| 2:54:06| And after he gets through, I'm going to move to postpone this for three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10446)|
| 2:54:10| because other governments are still going through their budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| and they may be implementing property tax increases elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10454)|
| 2:54:20| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10460)|
| 2:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10461)|
| 2:54:22| There are currently 20 counties and 20 cities in the State of Tennessee that have implemented the tax freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10462)|
| 2:54:32| None of those counties in question, as far as I know, have had a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| None of them, for sure, have gone through a reappraisal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10478)|
| 2:54:42| In looking at the numbers and so forth, I say I have some serious concerns about how this is going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10482)|
| 2:54:52| within a reappraisal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| I think it's going to have some significant negative consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10494)|
| 2:54:59| You know, Knox County is going through that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10499)|
| 2:55:03| Davidson County is also going through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10503)|
| 2:55:06| Shelby and Memphis will also be going through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| I think once you, you know, get through that, you will see some of the tricks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10509)|
| 2:55:15| or some of what I call the kind of unique mathematical glitches in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10515)|
| 2:55:21| And, again, I think Knox County is going to maybe experience some negative consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10521)|
| 2:55:27| as a result of this in a reappraisal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10527)|
| 2:55:31| And that is I think that they will not be able to take credit for any of the tax freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10531)|
| 2:55:36| and, therefore, they will actually, their certified tax rate will actually be lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10536)|
| 2:55:41| than what it would be to recoup the same amount of revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10541)|
| 2:55:46| which is the intent of the reappraisal or equalization law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10546)|
| 2:55:51| Again, we do know that there are costs associated with implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10551)|
| 2:55:58| Even if there are not a tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10558)|
| 2:56:03| the estimated staffing now for Knox County is probably one person just to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10563)|
| 2:56:11| That may be a little high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| But, again, there are some consequences and costs associated with it, even if nothing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10573)|
| 2:56:20| Given that there is no tax increase, it would be our recommendation that we at least defer action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10580)|
| 2:56:27| until we have some time to see how some of these work through and then take a look at it, you know, later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10587)|
| 2:56:35| Is three months adequate, Mr. York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| I mean, do we need an additional four months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| I've got to see how far off is September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10602)|
| 2:56:47| I don't think we'll actually get to see the consequences of the tax equalization probably until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| So if you did it in whatever the first or second council meeting in October, I think that would be a reasonable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10612)|
| 2:56:58| September is probably, you know, tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10618)|
| 2:57:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| I'll just respectfully move this to the second meeting in October as a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10622)|
| 2:57:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10627)|
| 2:57:08| Councilor Hollis, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| No, I'm okay with the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10631)|
| 2:57:12| I just want to remind council I shared a document months ago about sort of unintended consequences of tax freezes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10632)|
| 2:57:21| I think we're seeing what's happening in the state of California with local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10641)|
| 2:57:25| both with elderly property tax freezes and Proposition 13 and the impact it's had on local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10645)|
| 2:57:31| It's been absolutely disastrous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| So I think we need to be very careful about such things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10658)|
| 2:57:39| Yeah, I guess just one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10659)|
| 2:57:40| Definitely the postponement makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| I want to make sure that we do actually act on this before the five members that are not in my class leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10662)|
| 2:57:49| So I want to get you all an opportunity to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| Do you have class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| Councilman Hulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| Yes, I mean, with Councilman Hulk's comments there, do we have a choice in whether to enact this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10674)|
| 2:58:02| Because wasn't this a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10682)|
| 2:58:03| No, it gave local governments the ability to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10683)|
| 2:58:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10688)|
| 2:58:09| That's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10690)|

| 2:58:20| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10700)|

| 2:58:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10702)|
| 2:58:23| 12C is an ordinance to amend Section 17-74 of the Knoxville City Code entitled Traffic Violator School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10703)|
| 2:58:30| so as to provide for the provision of such schools or courses consistent with the provisions of current state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10710)|
| 2:58:36| Requested by Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10716)|
| 2:58:37| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10717)|
| 2:58:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10718)|
| 2:58:39| Ms. Riley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| The concern I have with this ordinance, Vice Mayor Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10721)|
| 2:58:46| is that there's no information for me about what the code says now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10726)|
| 2:58:52| And I realize I could have gone online and looked that up, but I was out of town and didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10732)|
| 2:58:58| And so I'm willing to pass this on first reading, but between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10738)|
| 2:59:03| either from Mr. Swanson or from Ms. Mitchell or somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10743)|
| 2:59:07| the ordinance says that we will delete the same in its entirety and substitute in lieu of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10747)|
| 2:59:13| and I can't vote on that unless I know what I'm changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10753)|
| 2:59:17| Done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| Let me speak for Mr. Swanson and say that's easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| What's the general purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| I mean, we're going to start allowing traffic schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| I mean, we're not going on our own county model, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10771)|
| 2:59:35| I think which is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| I think the proposal was that we would allow private individuals to also provide that service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10778)|
| 2:59:43| in addition to the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10783)|
| 2:59:47| There are lots of places to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| I'm inclined to say at some level I thought if there's a hard question that comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10789)|
| 2:59:56| what I'm going to say is I could have answered that at 830, but at 10 o'clock, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10796)|
| 3:00:03| And I've already forgotten your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10805)|
| 3:00:06| I believe it's lining up with the state law, in accordance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| Debbie is going to give a quick little summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10809)|
| 3:00:13| I've got it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10813)|
| 3:00:14| But essentially it says that the police department will provide the necessary instruction for this school at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10814)|
| 3:00:21| So that's the only authority is for the police department to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10821)|
| 3:00:25| And they can charge a fee up to $50, charge a fee of $50 per person to attend the violator school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10825)|
| 3:00:32| And this amendment would allow private companies to offer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10832)|
| 3:00:37| And does state law speak to this, that we must comply with one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10837)|
| 3:00:41| This tracks the state law almost exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| I took the state law and almost copied it over into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| adding only the part about you could have different courses of instruction and charge different fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10847)|
| 3:00:52| But does state law indicate that we change to allow private companies to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10852)|
| 3:00:57| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| Mr. Foster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10859)|
| 3:01:00| Is the police department offering this right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| Chief, do you want to give us a quick little?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| We are offering it right now and have for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10869)|
| 3:01:10| I mean, is it easily accessible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10870)|
| 3:01:11| I mean, do the classes occur with certain frequency or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10871)|
| 3:01:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10877)|
| 3:01:18| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10878)|
| 3:01:19| Two nights a week, off-duty officers teach the classes as an extra job, as an overtime assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10879)|
| 3:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10888)|
| 3:01:29| Do the fees cover what is the cost of the officers and any related material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10889)|
| 3:01:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10899)|
| 3:01:40| Currently, it's about $38,000 for the overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10900)|
| 3:01:46| and about $7,500 for the materials, books, registration, administrative fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10906)|
| 3:01:53| So it's about $45,500 a year in cost and the city nets between $50,000 and $60,000 beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10913)|
| 3:02:04| Excuse me, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10924)|
| 3:02:05| There is somebody signed up to speak for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| Don Weiser is signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10927)|
| 3:02:08| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10928)|
| 3:02:09| And, Don, if you want to speak, if you give us your name and address, and I apologize for not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10929)|
| 3:02:16| Don Weiser is my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10936)|

| 3:02:56| I'm a small veteran-run business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10976)|
| 3:03:04| The city charter stated that the safety director would appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10984)|
| 3:03:11| I went to Duane Ausitz and he gave me the recommendation that he would appoint me if he had the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10991)|
| 3:03:18| but we hadn't had a safety director in 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=10998)|
| 3:03:23| So what I attempted to do was to get the charter in compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11003)|
| 3:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11013)|

| 3:06:14| Terri, if you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11174)|
| 3:06:22| Terri Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11182)|
| 3:06:27| First, I want to say just as a citizen before I address the issue, the main issue that I came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11187)|
| 3:06:37| is I want to thank you for the careful consideration you're giving to providing public transit for all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11197)|
| 3:06:45| Providing an urban environment where physically challenged residents in Cagle Terrace in Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11205)|
| 3:06:55| and the elderly retired in Carlton Towers, which is now called 414,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11215)|
| 3:07:01| and others who did not want to drive everywhere but could live and safely access grocery stores, drugstores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11221)|
| 3:07:09| public transit was the impetus for the Bearden Village Plan, which was passed in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11229)|
| 3:07:18| And this is the impetus of the community leaders who continue to work to implement the goals in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11238)|
| 3:07:27| So we have spent almost 10 years working to make our area urban friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11247)|
| 3:07:41| We have worked with over 175 businesses, with developers, with the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11261)|
| 3:07:51| with TDOT, with all kinds of organizations like Knox Heritage and East Tennessee Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11271)|
| 3:07:58| in trying to achieve these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| Some recent developers that we've worked with are John Murphy of Murphy Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11281)|
| 3:08:07| Joe Harrison of Hunter Development, Jay McBride, Todd Wise, and Mike Realty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11287)|
| 3:08:13| And I say these things because when I address the reason that I'm here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11293)|
| 3:08:20| you'll know that we do like developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11300)|
| 3:08:23| We like appropriate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| We often work with developers to help them get their answers or use their reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11305)|
| 3:08:32| And we have had, in this economic environment, the most infill of any area in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11312)|
| 3:08:41| All of our vacant lots are almost infill because it's such a desirable place for businesses to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11321)|
| 3:08:49| I brought my long glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11329)|
| 3:08:55| Citizens and community leaders throughout the city and county have lost trust in MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11335)|
| 3:09:02| Among other things, they justifiably believe that MPC's philosophy of leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11342)|
| 3:09:09| is finding ways to circumvent the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11349)|
| 3:09:19| And some examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11359)|
| 3:09:22| After county commission decided not to approve a landscape business in an agricultural zone 17-0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11362)|
| 3:09:32| county BCA members asked for clarification about what is allowed in an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11372)|
| 3:09:41| In response, MPC made an amendment to the agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11381)|
| 3:09:47| in enabling landscape businesses to be located in an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11387)|
| 3:09:55| Secondly, a pharmacy seeking to locate in an inappropriate zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11395)|
| 3:10:06| and supported by MPC in West Knoxville was, in fact, a full-blown drugstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11406)|
| 3:10:12| They said that the pharmacy was needed there in order to combine special prescriptions for residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11412)|
| 3:10:19| in a nearby assisted living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11419)|
| 3:10:22| Number three, in the fall of 2008, they submitted a proposal to commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11422)|
| 3:10:29| to amend the list of permitted uses under neighborhood commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11429)|
| 3:10:33| to include a drive-thru car wash facility, which requires a use overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11433)|
| 3:10:40| The way in which they chose to support this use was with a zoning interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11440)|
| 3:10:46| so that a sign would not have to be on the site to inform affected neighborhoods, groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11446)|
| 3:10:52| what was planned for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11452)|
| 3:10:55| John Spoonaker, who was then the president of the West Knoxville Council of Homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11455)|
| 3:11:00| and now is on the county BCA, spoke at the MPC meeting and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11460)|
| 3:11:08| MPC needs to decide when they support a car wash that the applicant needs to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11468)|
| 3:11:15| to rezone the property to plan commercial and, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11475)|
| 3:11:20| not to try to sneak the car wash in under neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11480)|
| 3:11:26| The proposal was defeated by commissioners in a 96 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| These kind of actions are detrimental to city planning, our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11492)|
| 3:11:36| our developers, and our citizens and destroys trust in an agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11496)|
| 3:11:41| which is now celebrating 50 years of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11501)|
| 3:11:46| We all deserve better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11506)|
| 3:11:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11508)|
| 3:11:50| Thanks. Jim Blattner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11510)|
| 3:11:55| Jim Blattner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| I'll try to keep this short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| I feel like I need to go home and have a shower and a shave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11519)|
| 3:12:03| First thing I'd like to say is I'd like to remind Mr. Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11523)|
| 3:12:06| and I believe Mr. King was there too at a meeting that we had in the Bearden Council in January 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11526)|
| 3:12:12| and we expressed at that meeting the concern that we had over how codes were being enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11532)|
| 3:12:18| confusion that we might have had over what the codes actually said and with the functioning of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11538)|
| 3:12:24| I'd like for you to think about this and put this on your agenda, Mayor, for next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11544)|
| 3:12:29| Because at that meeting, Mr. Hill came up with what I thought was a very good suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11549)|
| 3:12:35| and I heard the need for it echoed again Thursday night when we met with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11555)|
| 3:12:40| in the discussion after the meeting with some of the staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11560)|
| 3:12:43| That's one of the reasons why they feel that we're not always on the same page on things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11563)|
| 3:12:48| is because there is no central database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| Do you remember that discussion, Mr. Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11570)|
| 3:12:52| when you suggested that this would be a good thing to get everybody on the same page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11572)|
| 3:12:57| that we needed a central database where you could keep things like TDOT and CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11577)|
| 3:13:03| and some of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11583)|
| 3:13:04| So, again, I remind you because you've got a lot better concept of it than I'll ever have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11584)|
| 3:13:09| and you knew what you were talking about, and I remembered that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| and I think it could be valuable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11592)|
| 3:13:16| Council members, I want you to consider a couple of things about the ongoing discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11596)|
| 3:13:21| that we've had with you on MPC and that we've had with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11601)|
| 3:13:28| And I want you to consider a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11608)|
| 3:13:32| I want you to look at the number of the signers of the letter that you got about MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11612)|
| 3:13:37| That was 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| Now, these signers weren't rookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11619)|
| 3:13:42| You know, this is just not new people that are just out there signing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11622)|
| 3:13:48| Most of us have been dealing with neighborhood issues for a number of years with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11628)|
| 3:13:53| with MPC staff, and with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11633)|
| 3:13:56| Over this time span, many years, several MPC directors and several city administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11636)|
| 3:14:07| Have you ever heard this much dissatisfaction with MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11647)|
| 3:14:13| I haven't, and I've been dealing with it for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| because my mom was on one of the original MPC commissions to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11656)|
| 3:14:25| We're not a bunch of troublemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11665)|
| 3:14:29| We, as a whole, are people who like to avoid conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11669)|
| 3:14:33| Most of us have appeared before many governmental bodies on numerous occasions in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11673)|
| 3:14:38| You're aware that often we are able to find a way to compromise situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11678)|
| 3:14:44| rather than fight about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11684)|
| 3:14:45| I think a perfect example is just what Ms. Faulkner talked about with the Bearden Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| and the 175 businesses that we've worked with over the 10 years to build a better community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11690)|
| 3:14:57| Getting what we all want, including MPC, is a win-win situation for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11697)|
| 3:15:03| That's what works best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11703)|
| 3:15:05| And I know that I sat here, we came here many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11705)|
| 3:15:09| talking about the overlay in Sequoia Hills on Scenic Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11709)|
| 3:15:14| Mr. Hall and I left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| We're still good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11716)|
| 3:15:18| We worked out a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11718)|
| 3:15:23| Some of you went to the meeting last Thursday night, and some of those concerns were voiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11723)|
| 3:15:30| For those of you who weren't there, I want to point out something to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11730)|
| 3:15:34| There was a very large crowd there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11734)|
| 3:15:35| It was around 70 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11735)|
| 3:15:38| And to the MPC's credit, most of their staff was in attendance, particularly their senior staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11738)|
| 3:15:45| which I think they were there and they listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11745)|
| 3:15:49| Hopefully it was taken to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11749)|
| 3:15:53| But what you need to realize is that that large crowd was augmented by a fairly large number of county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11753)|
| 3:16:03| They weren't invited to this particular meeting, and several of them even spoke at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11763)|
| 3:16:10| They attended because they felt that they had problems that needed to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11770)|
| 3:16:16| and they wanted to be there in support so that we could all work better with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11776)|
| 3:16:22| Many of them told us, we wish we lived in the city so we could have signed the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11782)|
| 3:16:29| Yesterday, when you had your budget hearings on MPC and later on the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11789)|
| 3:16:37| it was after one of the council members said, MPC has always done what we ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11797)|
| 3:16:43| I think, General, that's probably correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11803)|
| 3:16:46| About 30 more seconds, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11806)|
| 3:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11807)|
| 3:16:48| However, please take to heart Mr. Redman's comments yesterday regarding the rewriting of the form for appeals for MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11808)|
| 3:16:56| that has not been done correctly in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| It's not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| Consider the letter that Councilman Pillow and Councilman Frost wrote asking for better neighborhood input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11821)|
| 3:17:10| No reply in over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11830)|
| 3:17:13| Simple courtesy demanded a reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11833)|
| 3:17:15| And please consider that when action is taken, it's also a matter of how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11835)|
| 3:17:21| When the executive director spoke yesterday in response to a question from council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11841)|
| 3:17:26| on a meeting he said was a sector plan, not a one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11846)|
| 3:17:31| That was a response he had in a question that was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11851)|
| 3:17:34| But he ignored the fact that the meeting was held on February the 14th at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11854)|
| 3:17:40| And that was really what he was asked to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11860)|
| 3:17:44| So when addressing the concerns which were expressed by the citizens group and how MPC handled them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11864)|
| 3:17:50| he talked mostly about our mistakes and our misunderstandings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11870)|
| 3:17:55| Frankly, this didn't surprise any of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11875)|
| 3:17:58| as this is how we have often felt we have been treated at MPC workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11878)|
| 3:18:03| particularly those dealing with neighborhood issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11883)|
| 3:18:06| Is this fixable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11886)|
| 3:18:08| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11888)|
| 3:18:09| We've worked well together in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11889)|
| 3:18:10| We need to define a process of how ordinances are developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11890)|
| 3:18:16| And we also need to have an attitude change when dealing with neighborhood reps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11896)|
| 3:18:21| so that we don't feel that we are always making mistakes and always misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11901)|
| 3:18:27| Because for us, the neighborhood reps who have been doing it for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11907)|
| 3:18:32| we have our fingers on the pulse of the problems in our areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11912)|
| 3:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11916)|
| 3:18:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11918)|
| 3:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11919)|
| 3:18:40| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11920)|
| 3:18:41| Thank you very much, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=11921)|
