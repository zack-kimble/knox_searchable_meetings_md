| 0:00:45| Sorry for my lack of preparedness last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=45)|
| 0:00:46| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| We'll forgive you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| We need to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| We don't need to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| ... anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| We're going to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| You don't have anything either for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| No, we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=55)|

| 0:00:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| Good luck with Just Ripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Do you want to say anything about it or just let us...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| About your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Do you want to tell us anything about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| We won't get a better opportunity with an audience of thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| I didn't know I'd have the opportunity yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| We specialize in high-end provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| We have a precious shortage of fine foods availability in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| Hope you all come and check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| We source most of our foods from the regional area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| There's quite a few very, very sustainable farming operations locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| that don't have a viable marketing outlet except for the farmer's market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| so we want to provide an alternative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Perhaps this is one of those entrepreneur deals that we've just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Next is Preservation Pub, and they had four special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| Cullen Kehoe, 28 Market Square, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Ms. Dyer, file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Officer Price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| We need the motion before we get favorable, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Good luck with all these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| The third is Rocky Top's Piano Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| Rusty Penland, 1901 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| We need to render the former owner's beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Officer Price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Mr. Penland needs to come in for his fingerprints and his background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Have they completed the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| We were there Thursday morning at 915, waited half an hour before anybody told us that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| weren't going to do the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| I went by this morning to do fingerprinting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| They wouldn't let me do it this morning either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| When do you have an appointment to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| I've called to make appointments four times, and they always tell me I don't need an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| And then when I show up, they tell me I need an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| I'll be there this Thursday morning at 915 like I have the last two Thursdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Unless we have another snow, ice event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| I'll be there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| You'll be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| I was this past Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| I think we need a motion to postpone to March the 17th, which is two weeks from tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=203)|
| 0:03:33| Will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| I guess it has to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| I mean, we've been waiting for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Well, I'd like to make a motion that we postpone this to the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Officer, is there any, like, snow day makeups you guys are having in light of what happened the last two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| No, sir, but I do have an answer to his fingerprint question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| Would you go ahead and tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| When you call in to the police department, there's several different ways you can get fingerprinted for an employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| You can get fingerprinted for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| That's two separate things, and it's confusion with the Teleserv officers that are telling people they don't have to have an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| because they don't for a background check for employment purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| But for our purposes, you do have to have an appointment, and we have addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Is there a different number, or you just say, I want to go to a beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| No, and if he comes in on this Thursday, we will fingerprint him during his task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| It's the same number, and every time I call, I say, for a beer permit, and they always tell me that I don't need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| Like I said, it's a confusion with the employees inside of the Teleserv office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| If you'll hang out here when we finish, I'll take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| I guess my question is, how did this one end up on the docket for tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| We postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| We postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| We postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| He went there last Thursday, and they were shut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| So that's why he's on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Here you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| So we need to—I make a motion that we defer this to the 17th of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=291)|
| 0:04:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| I have a second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150303?start=304)|
