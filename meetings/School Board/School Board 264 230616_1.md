| 2:58:25| Thanks, I'm glad this was smoothed down because I'm short too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| Good evening, I wanted to tell you all how excited I am about the strategic plan for Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10709)|
| 2:58:34| The methodology that was used to gain input from so many stakeholders was very well done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10714)|
| 2:58:40| especially including the parents and the students in the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10720)|
| 2:58:43| Such a good precedent to set for the improvements we all want to see for students and the teachers who have called to serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10723)|
| 2:58:49| I noticed several comments from students that I've also heard over the past few years with regards to the discipline expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10729)|
| 2:58:56| and I'm so hoping that this new strategic plan, there will also be clearly defined goals and objectives designed to address the discipline disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10736)|
| 2:59:04| that have been so apparent in what we're now calling Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10744)|
| 2:59:07| I think the Region 5 way is setting a precedent for excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| That's very exciting, but it will fall short if the discipline disparities are not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10750)|
| 2:59:15| So I wanted to encourage you as a board to make sure the data regarding discipline disparities is made available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10755)|
| 2:59:20| along with the other measurements being taken to determine improvement in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| I also want to encourage the training and implementation of restorative practices in all classrooms in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10765)|
| 2:59:31| I understand from talking with Janice Cook that there's a restorative classroom in each school with coaches in these classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10771)|
| 2:59:38| But what I hear from the students and the teachers is that these classrooms are viewed by students as just an in-school suspension room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10778)|
| 2:59:45| which completely negates the restorative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10785)|
| 2:59:48| So often the coaches have to be pulled to sub or perform other duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| So it's imperative that all staff be trained in restorative practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10791)|
| 2:59:55| Each classroom, hallway, cafeteria, library, etc. become a place where students experience the community that comes from the restorative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10795)|
| 3:00:04| Thank you for your commitment to success for every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| and for considering how restorative practices can be a huge part of addressing discipline disparities and achieving the success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10806)|
| 3:00:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10816)|
| 3:00:17| Madam Chair, this concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10817)|
| 3:00:23| With that, our meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10823)|
| 3:00:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230616?start=10853)|
