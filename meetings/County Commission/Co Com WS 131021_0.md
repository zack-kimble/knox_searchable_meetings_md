| 0:01:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| We have several lights on, and we have some people who want to do public speaking, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| we'll get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| But we'll start with Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| Yes, I have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| I like to bring it on at the end of the agenda, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| You need a title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Do you need a title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Oh, I want to discuss why we're paying a court reporter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| for taking minutes of the audit committee meeting when we have county court clerks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=113)|
| 0:02:03| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| I'd like to add a discussion item as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| I'd like to ask some questions of Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=126)|
| 0:02:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Do you have his consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| Commissioner Shouse, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Set your light on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I'd like to defer my discussion item to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| In general, I think it's probably better for us to discuss the joint education committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| at commission meeting and not the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| So we'll talk about that next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| Item number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| You said next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Can we move up 903 ahead of 808?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| They kind of coincided with each other and they kind of got that out of kilter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Or move 808 behind 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| I'm good either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| You have that, girls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Any objection to that, commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=204)|
| 0:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| I have six people here, commissioners, on public forum that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| I want to mention this to the people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| And a lot of them, let's see here, knocks high, knocks high, knocks high, knocks high, knocks high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| To the people that want to speak, we can call you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| Or if you want to wait until we come up to that part in the agenda, if you have to leave now, you're welcome to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| But I think you'd be more effective if you speak when we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| That's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| So if you want to come during public forum and do that right now, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| Or if you want to wait until we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| Seeing nobody come to the podium, commissioners, we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| I have submitted from the chairman's proposed consent agenda, and I will go over that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Oh, Amy, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Oh, yes, you had something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| I just wanted to recognize one of our citizens, Martha Rose Woodward, who's here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| Martha, if you'd stand up for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Martha has recently published a book called Watermelon for Everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| And it has been nominated in an international cookbook contest and hopefully will win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=285)|
| 0:04:55| And it's going to the competition will take place in Beijing, China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| And so after this cookbook wins this contest, we will have Martha back for a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| But we're very, very proud of Martha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| She's a long-time school teacher and author and all-around jewel of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| So thanks, Martha, for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| And good luck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Let's go over the consent agenda that Commissioner Anders had put out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| If anything wants to pull off, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Consent is 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=328)|

| 0:06:43| Hut, hut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Does anybody wish to pull anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Commissioner Hammond, I see your light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| I guess I'd like to pull number 29 from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Also, with regards to the resolution on Jewelry TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| we will have some representatives here next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| So I guess technically I want to pull it from consent so it can be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| and we can recognize these folks at the meeting on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| I'd like to pull 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| I've just got a quick question for the Sheriff on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| I have a quick question on nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| On number nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=442)|
| 0:07:35| Anything to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| Do I hear a motion to approve the consent list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| First item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| On page 11, item number 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| we have a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| approving a contract to purchase property for a regional forensic facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| We have a letter from the mayor's office here to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=501)|
| 0:08:34| Chris Carlaw, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| We, in the past couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| have learned that our lease with UT expires at the end of December 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| and so we have to find a place for our medical examiner's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| And so, in doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| we've been working with the state on a couple of things about creating a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| regional center, and we'll be talking more as we get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| And so, in doing so, we had to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| We had to find a facility to purchase for our center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| and what we came across was a facility that's 18,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| It's on Sullins Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| It was appraised at about $1.89 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| And we're purchasing it for right at $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| So it's about $55 or $56 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| And in doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| we know that we're going to put about $3 to $4 million in build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| and renovation costs into it for probably a total cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| once we're complete, of around $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| We do anticipate maybe getting some resources from the state to help pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| We have been in contact with them and met with the governor about them helping us with a regional center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=595)|
| 0:10:04| and they're interested in having a regional forensic center in East Tennessee to help with the surrounding 22 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| And in doing so, they would maybe offset the cost of the facility for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| But we will not know that answer until it is in the governor's proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| which he'll introduce in January or February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| So if they do not, and we'll go on to kind of the 808, which is following this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| So if not, then the county is willing and able to put up the cost of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=633)|
| 0:10:42| And so Resolution 808 deals with the financing piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| And we can talk about that when we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| But this resolution is just giving us the authority to purchase the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| and to start the renovation and build-out piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| We have several lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Chris, what is the location again, did you say, and what used to be in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| It's an old, it's the old Solon Street Surgery Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| I think it's 2716 Solon Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| I think that is, that's the correct address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| It's right off from Kingston Pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| It's beside of Second Prez Church on Kingston Pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| It is zoned appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| So zoning is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| And it's 18,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| I think our current center is about 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| We have several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| I hear Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| I think your light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Was it Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Can I ask you an 808 question also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| It's general obligation capital outlay notes and not really bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Am I reading that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Let me explain that for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| We have to get prior approval from commission to handle the financing piece before we start with the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=722)|
| 0:12:11| So this is what this is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| And the thought process is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| We've got about $25 million in our debt service fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| But we can only use that fund balance to pay off debt, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| So what we're going to do is we're going to get, assuming the state does not pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| we will get a three-year capital note for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| And in, let's say, 30, 60, or 90 days, go ahead and pay it off in full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| and use the fund balance to do that, which will reduce the amount of interest that we have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| I was hoping when I noticed this that we were going under the assumption the state was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| I guess we're still going under the assumption, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Since it's what, our county and 22 others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Yeah, 18 to 20 to 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| We have to make that sale, and I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| And the state's going to help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| It's hardly equitable if we have to pick up the tab for all other 20-plus counties around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| If the state did not, do we have a plan B that we can recoup some of the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| I think what we do then is, as we do the contracts with the other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| we first, we know we want to put in there enough to offset the overhead of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| But what we also want to do is, if the state doesn't pay for us to recoup some of our capital cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| that we have put into that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| And you're calling it a forensic center, public building, and law enforcement facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| What's the law enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Is that just a technicality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| I mean, I think there's a law enforcement piece when it comes to the medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| A coroner type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| This is just a general question, not only pertaining to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| but some of the other things that we've done, like the senior-senior cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| I mean, I think these are things that the commission, by our actions, have agreed that we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| You know, my question is, are we better off leasing space or buying things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| Just what Commissioner Schaus just referred to is we're taking a large amount of capital money and putting into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=868)|
| 0:14:36| We're taking these properties off the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| We're having to put capital into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| I know what's happened out in my district with the senior center is that we've outgrown the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| but we're sort of stuck with the property because we own it and we can't move into something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| And I'm not advocating one thing or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| but, you know, we're looking for something to do with the old St. Mary's if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| and when it gets moved somewhere else so we don't have an empty building in a blighted neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=899)|
| 0:15:07| You know, that's a tax-paying entity right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| And, you know, we're taking a million-dollar, a million-and-a-half-dollar building off the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| You know, we don't know what size we'll need 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| And would we be better off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| I mean, this is just a matter of principle than the county buying more property, of leasing property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| keeping it on the tax rolls when the roof leaks, somebody else has to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| When there's flooding in the thing, somebody else has to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| Just that as far as, you know, not only a capital outlay, but also a maintenance and tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| and all those other considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| I mean, it's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| I think more times than not we would agree that that's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| But this is a situation where if we were to lease, we'd have to put probably the four to five million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| into the property that we did not own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| And that's not an advantageous thing to do because what we need to do is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| this is a thing I think the state wants us to do from the standpoint of a regional facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| I think this is a point that it's better that we're getting this facility for 52% of the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=968)|
| 0:16:19| I think that's the reason where I would say that this is a time to buy rather than to lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=979)|
| 0:16:28| Commissioner Brown, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Did you think anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| I changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Commissioner Shouse asked some of the questions that I was concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| is the fact that we may be able to recoup some of our costs in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| if we've got 20 counties that we're going to be doing services for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| But the bottom line is that by next December we have to be ready to move someplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| and we've got to do it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| And I would totally agree with you that putting money in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| of our county money into a leased property is not the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| So I think this is a great idea and I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| You know, I'm more in line with Commissioner Briggs in that this seems like a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| you know, a good deal, I guess, is a large investment on a promise from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| You know, I'd be, I mean, at a minimum I'd be okay with purchasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| But until we get something a little more concrete from the state, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| for us to invest $5 million with the state and want to have an investment in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| I mean, if they're going to sink money into it, hopefully not just capital but operational money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| it seems like they may want some ownership if we go on the ownership route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| That's why I'm, you know, I'm thinking at this point leasing seems to be better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1076)|
| 0:18:04| at least until we can get some kind of obligation from the state as to their path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| Are they supportive of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| I know you all have intense conversations, and I truly appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| because I know we've, you know, we're having to paint a picture for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| to let them know that this is a regional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| But for us to go ahead and appropriate the whole $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| or not to exceed $5 million at this point is, I think, might be a bit premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| But we're not appropriating the whole $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Now we're appropriating the cost of the building, and then we're going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| We don't know what the state is going to do, but we know how much money we've got to put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| But if the state doesn't do anything, we've still got to put the whole thing in there and get this thing running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| If the state doesn't, we may not want a $5 million building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| We have a facility that sounds like it's going to potentially operate for 23 counties as opposed to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1141)|
| 0:19:10| But this 808, which I appreciate Commissioner Shouse asking can we discuss that at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| because I know 903 is before us, is for the $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| I mean, it's for the whole kit and caboodle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| And that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Should we just say $2 million or maybe take another look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Again, I just think at this point we're, again, and my heart goes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| because I know you all are just trying to, you all have a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| It's December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| You all are moving out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| But for us to do the whole $5 million investment on a probably a strong promise, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1180)|
| 0:19:49| I know the mayor knows these parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| I mean, the governor knows these parts fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| But, you know, at the same time, he has a legislative body that he has to convince as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| So, again, just kind of voicing some concern about us moving out for the whole $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| I would say this, that the regional concept is contingent on everyone buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| and getting approval from the commission and the state and all the counties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| And so if the counties involved and the state doesn't do their piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| and that becomes Knox County's regional, not regional, but Knox County's M.E.'s office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| we are bound by the charter to have this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| And so that's what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| And we know that we're going to be out of a building in 14 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| And I think what we will do as far as the build-out goes is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| dependent on what we're hearing from other counties, we'll scale that back if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| And to make some clarification on 808, this just gives us the approval to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| and do a capital outlay note for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| We're not going to actually do anything with it until we hear anything from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| And so that's just we can't do it after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| We've got to do it beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| And so it's just a matter of it's kind of a legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| We can't go ahead and buy it and then say we're going to do a capital note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| We're just saying up to a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| If everything happens that we think will happen, then we have to go for that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| But we think the states want to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| But if they don't, we need this piece to be able to do what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| So, again, theoretical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| And so we counted, I mean, the state doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| The other, you know, we get five counties and not all 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| We still, would anything come back before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| This seems like this 808 gives you all the approval to go out for the full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| So that, I guess, is my kind of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| So let's say we get ten counties of the 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| We still have the approval to do the $5 million obligation bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| If the state pays, then we don't do any capital note at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| If the state pays, we don't have to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| If the state doesn't pay, then what you may do is scale that back from five to, let's say, two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| And then what we'll do is come back before you and say, we didn't need this capital note of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| What we needed was 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| And what we're doing with this capital note is it's a way for us to utilize the fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| and the debt service to make that payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| That's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| So thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Commissioner McKenzie, I think what our conversation, your conversation with me right now at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| is that something has to come first, the chicken or the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| And the other thing is 23 counties is a fairly significant legislative force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1377)|
| 0:23:07| Something's got to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| And I would agree with your stipulation that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| we're not going to go full-blown if we're going Knox County alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| I mean, I think the administration understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| So I'll be comfortable with 808 whenever it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| Let's go to Commissioner Schatz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| One final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Chris, we're still on a downward path, even with the five million, if it's hung around our neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| I mean, we still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| And I would tell you that the five isn't going to be debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| That's going to be a capital note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| So that doesn't show up as long-term debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| And it would be something that we would pay in 60 days out of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| Service fund balance would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| Out of the state money or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Either state money or debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| We have Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| And this is just, you know, just in case something comes up between now and next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| I'd like to make a substitute motion we move on with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| That way we can discuss it next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| I don't know if there's a motion on the floor or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| 903 is just a motion to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| Yeah, that's what I was telling Commissioner Schatz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| So I'll reserve that for 808.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Regardless of whether it's ten counties or 20 counties come in, to build a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| you have to have a certain amount of machines and facilities available to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1473)|
| 0:24:42| whether you're doing ten of them a month or whether you're doing 100 of them a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| If you do 100, you've got to have a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| But we still have to have a basic setup to be able to do the complete work they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| And that's what we're mandated to do in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| All this other is just extra that we can add to it, being a helping neighbor to our neighboring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| Get some money put back into the coffers too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Let me just make one more comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| And I agree with what Mike says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| But every hospital in this city has autopsy facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| And I really don't know what extent they would require if they would be large enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| And I just didn't know if that was explored, is to contract that space where the equipment's there, the rooms are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| the refrigerators are there, the microscopes are there, the testing ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| Because when you do have something like this drawn, they always test for, you know, for drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| I mean, and many other things too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| And it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| I mean, you know, do we have to build something from the ground up when it may already be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| That's my only question is, can we contract with someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| We know there's going to be a facility just a little bit north of here that's going to be vacant probably before too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| I'm based on the actions of the city council last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| And, you know, I mean, they can do autopsies there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| And I don't know what capacity they have for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| But they've got everything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| And it's going to be abandoned pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| The hospitals, as we were told this week, are contracting that piece with UPPC currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| And they don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| And they're not doing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| And so they will contract with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| That's what we were told by UPPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| That was Friday, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| And so, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Well, they contract with them because they don't have the experts and the personnel to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| You know, forensic pathology is a subspecialty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| I won't say anything more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| I'm not a subspecialist in forensic pathology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| When we negotiated this contract however many years ago it was, I don't recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| I did some research on whether the existing facilities were interested in housing this or taking on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| None of them were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| They really don't have the capacity within their pathology departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| and their morgues to do what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| It's so specialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| And she's currently serving most of those counties we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| And they're going to have a hard time finding someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| So I imagine they're going to be interested in helping us do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Again, they just don't have the capacity and didn't have the interest in gaining the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| The only reason I say that is that then there was, I don't know when you looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| but at that time there was probably no intention to build a new hospital at Weiss Garber and Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| And I'm not talking about the individual pathologists because we need someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| You have to have a forensic pathologist to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| I mean, they would have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| But I'm talking about just a place to actually, you know, house the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| And particularly if you have a 450-bed hospital that's going to be empty in the middle of a residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| is, you know, looking to see if the capacity could be expanded there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| I mean, just at least to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| And that's the only reason I mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| And I haven't talked to any, just, you know, for full disclosure, I've not talked to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| I've not done anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| I don't know if it's even possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| But it would be a lot cheaper than putting $5 million into something if the capacity is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and then letting it sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| But I'm not talking about individuals or other people doing it because we have to have the same people doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| But I'm talking about just a place to physically put it because that's what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| We're not talking about hiring new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| And I believe on the consent agenda up here with Dr. Malusnik, you know, I'm not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1721)|
| 0:28:50| And we've already put that on the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| But I'm talking about just physically a place to do it so we're not having a, you know, duplication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| and we're not spending more money on something that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| That's all I wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| What would we do with the rest of the big building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| What now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| What would we do with the rest of that big building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| You're talking about the one you're buying or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| No, you're talking about St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| No, I'm not talking about buying anything from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| I'm talking about leasing the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| I mean, there's going to be other things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I mean, there's an outpatient surgery center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| There's an emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| There's a long-term care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| There's talk about putting a long-term care facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| But I'm talking about just having that part of the facility because that's done already at hospitals in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| You have outside entities that come in and lease space within the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| If anybody's had any relatives, there's an entity called Select Hospitals that has nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| And they're at Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| They're at Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| And I think they're trying to put one in over at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| But they have their outside for-profit incorporated company that comes in and leases space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| That's all I'm mentioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Did you get an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Were you looking for an answer, Rick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Well, no, I just asked, did we look at other alternatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| Well, I do know that when this first came up, I hammered Chris pretty hard about the old St. Mary's building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| and would still like to have that looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| I'm not sure that it was ever thoroughly investigated as a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| but I think with you that it's going to be empty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| I mean, there's already some facilities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Would it be cheaper to expand that or reconfigure that the way that we need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| and lease it rather than buying or building a brand-new facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| So, and like I said, I hammered him pretty hard, and he shot me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| So, step up, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| We took her to look at several facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| and let her gauge her interest on what would be best for her and the practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| I would say once again that I'm hesitant to put $4 million to $5 million into a facility that we don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| I mean, we're going to do upgrades to $3 million to $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| I would prefer to own that than to lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| But that's just my mindset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| And as far as 808 goes, when you all get to 808,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Mark Mametoff is here, our bond counsel, and he may address that a lot better than myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Thanks for all the work that you've put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Martha, thank you for what you've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| We have a 903 before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| We have a proper first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| 808.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Item 31 is a resolution authorizing the insurance of interest-bearing general obligation capital outlay notes of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1907)|
| 0:31:57| and an aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| making provision for the insurance sale and payment of said notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| establishing the terms thereof and the disposition of proceeds therefrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| and providing for the levy of a tax for the payment of principal thereof and interest thereon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| This is Resolution 808.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Motion to pass without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| First and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| You don't want to discuss it before we wait until Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| Since Mark's here, I'd like to hear what he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| It sounds like you're just dying to tell us something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Mark, name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| I really came to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| This is a standard form of capital outlay note resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| Capital outlay notes are short-term debt instruments that you're allowed to issue under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| You can issue them either on a negotiated or on a public sale basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| I think the thought here was that you would likely hopefully get state funding, as you just talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| so the thought would be that if you do have to borrow any money, you would do it on a short-term basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and pay it off once you got the state funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| And so this short-term debt instrument would allow you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| And so this is somewhat prophylactic in a way in that by adopting this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| if you spend any money on this project, it allows you to reimburse yourselves under federal tax laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| and so it's a step in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| It also allows the county to go ahead and get approval for issuing this type of debt from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| So if you do decide to proceed, you'll be ready to go with it instead of having to wait on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| So that's the primary purpose of, I think, going ahead with this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| Are you also going to speak to the $22 million TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I am here as well for that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| In my role as bond counsel of the KCDC on that one, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| I'm going to switch hats, yes, at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| So, Mark, so I guess in terms of process, and this may be a question for Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| so we can get up to and this is a nice way of being able to get, you know, zero up to 5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| Is there any obligation, again, to come back before this body if the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| There's no, from a bond perspective, there's no obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| This is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| This would allow you to borrow up to $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| and would allow Chris's office to proceed to get the necessary approval from the state comptroller's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| to issue the note and there would not be any further approvals required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| This is not like when you do a bond issue where you do an initial resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| and then do a bond resolution separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| Based on what information has been given to us here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| the fact that Chris has outlined the fact that we need to have this available almost immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| and we're only going to be using what we need as we need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| I'd like to make a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2105)|
| 0:35:14| Second for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| All right, it's been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| I'm just trying to figure out what that accomplishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I mean, there's going to be a vote Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Hopefully I don't think Chris is taking this personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| I mean, this isn't nothing that I'm trying to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| I mean, the vote's going to be Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| This is a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| I mean, so there's no harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| To be quite honest, I don't want to vote no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| because I don't want to show that I'm against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| But if you want to have that substitute motion, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| And I'll vote no and we'll talk about it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| But there's nothing advantageous about passing this as opposed to passing along with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| So I'm just trying to understand the logic behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Yeah, this is just a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| And, I mean, I really agree with Sam, I agree with Mike, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| if we're going to do this, we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| And I brought those other things up just as a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| But if, let's say this passes unanimously today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| and Sam has some questions about it because we don't vote on the consent agenda until Monday anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| So it really doesn't change anything what the vote does today one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| But it's a vote of confidence to Chris and the mayor and whoever's working this deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| that if they know that tentatively, I mean, you know, 99% of the time they've got our backing on the deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| and it's probably 99% going to go through on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| If they get a chance on Wednesday or Thursday this week to do something to move it a little bit further forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| they have more confidence in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| So that's my only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| I don't think it's worth wasting a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| I was just going to clarify that just so we know that we can pull this thing off and it can be reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| I just wanted to clarify that in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Commissioner, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| We have a substitute motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Vote on the substitute motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2238)|

| 0:40:23| Is it possible that next Monday we vote on the four we want, whatever, that one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2423)|
| 0:40:32| could be take this last month of this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| You've got to vote here for one person to serve for a month, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| Well, actually two weeks or ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2441)|

| 0:41:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Can I have one clarification on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| Is that these are appointments that the commission are permitted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| I mean, because we ran into this one time before on the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| is that the Ethics Committee had some appointments and the commission had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| and the mayor had some and the sheriff had some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| And we ended up, some of the people appointed people that they didn't have the authority to appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| And then we had an embarrassing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| Now, the ones that we're talking about here are ones that the commission are authorized to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| I mean, those particular slots are slots that are commissioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| Commission slots, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| Item number nine is confirming the Knox County Mayor's reappointments of Billy Stokes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| and Scott Davis to the Public Building Authority Board of Directors Resolution 114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Properly first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Yeah, I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| It was kind of similar to the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| So term limits for PBA, what are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| They would be two terms, just like any other committee that you all have restricted to two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| It would be two full terms according to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| Partial terms would not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| So some of these, I don't know about these two, I don't know anything about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Some of these probably came in with partial terms, so they'll get two additional terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| On page four, item number 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| approving an agreement with the City of Knoxville to receive funds in the amount of $53,546| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| for the purpose of creating a compliance officer position as part of the Knoxville Police Department's grant award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| to encourage arrest policies and enforcement of protection order programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| A local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| This is Resolution 303.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| Been moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| JJ, can you explain this just real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Just hit the highlights on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Is this just salary or is there any other things with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| The $53,000 includes benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| I think the pay is $34,000 a year for a total of $53,500, including benefits per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| It's a compliance officer that will make sure, work with circuit court, Judge Swann's court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| to make sure that the domestic violence individuals follow the rules and regulations that the judge sets out for them to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| and make sure they comply with their orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| That's the only question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Anybody else have any questions of JJ while he's there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| It's been properly first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| On page 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| Item number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| This is a resolution determining the method of disposal of property located at 101 East 5th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| also known as the historic Knoxville High School, to be through the request of proposals process resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| I hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| I hear a proper first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Commissioner Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2685)|
| 0:44:56| Where did Mr. Holt go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| QO 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2706)|
| 0:45:13| Question, Mr. Chairman, as to procedure on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| You mentioned earlier that those that came to speak will speak at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| Do we get a motion for it before they speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Or do they need to speak beforehand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Or what's your projected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| I believe number 26 is the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Larry, I think it's 26 that they're going to want to speak at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| The next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| This is a method of disposal, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| I think the one they want to speak to is 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2739)|
| 0:45:49| Hugh, anything you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Any discussion you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| I'll wait until 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| The reason this one is before us, then, is to just accept the process that's been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2756)|
| 0:46:05| It does not mean we're going to accept their product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Or it does mean we're going to accept their product is tied to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| It's sort of like I'm not getting into the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| This is just housekeeping to say that we accept, for the time being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| the process that's been used to try to determine the method of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Is it Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| If we're accepting the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| does that mean that we have to accept either of any of the suggested outcomes of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| Could there be another proposal outside what the RFP process was if we approved this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2813)|
| 0:47:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| In that case, I would like to make a substitute motion that we send this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| That's been properly first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Any discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| We're on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| This is an almost after-the-fact type situation because it's already been --it's not determining the method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| I think it's already been done, you know, from what I gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| I mean, it's like discussing the game that's over on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| I mean, I just don't know what putting that part off a week would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| Maybe I'm not understanding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| No, that's exactly --it's a matter of a housekeeping issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| Back in several months ago when the commission had accepted Knox-Hobb from the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2870)|
| 0:47:58| at that time the general consensus of the commission was to sell this by RFP, not public auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| so we could sort of direct what type of development that would be sitting on that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| And I just failed to get it on the commission's agenda the previous month to get your approval on the method of disposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2891)|
| 0:48:21| And that's 110 percent my error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| So I think what Dr. Briggs and I will agree upon is that we either need to accept this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| or make an amended motion to say sell by live auction or not sell at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| I mean, we need a motion before us that I think we're going to live with come next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| It does not affect the outcome of 26, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| If we do not accept this being disposed of by RFP, then there's no 26 in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2937)|
| 0:49:11| And then when 26 is before us, the proper vote would be up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2951)|
| 0:49:20| Mr. Law Director, maybe I fired from the hip there, but does that sound like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| Well, what you have here is basically what we'd say by dicta the county commission implied to use the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2965)|
| 0:49:35| Purchasing went and used the RFP process, but technically forgot to get your approval to use the RFP process in a formality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2975)|
| 0:49:44| What they have before you today is they're requesting the formality that was more dicta in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2984)|
| 0:49:52| And that's really all you're voting on right now is what we call the method of disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| And you only have, like, three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| And this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| And this is the one that was implied to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| And it was just an administrative failure to get your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| And so they're asking for your approval now for a method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| Because they've already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| And that's what I was trying to imply just a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| It's already been done, so we might as well take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| And then that properly puts the 26 before us so that we can discuss it and either approve it or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3023)|
| 0:50:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Mr. Chairman, I just want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| This is a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| So even if we approve this today, whatever we do, it doesn't become final until next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| So any action we take is basically it's not official is what I guess I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| I believe that the RFP process was proper and that everything was done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| But I have received, I'm sure as you have, a number of e-mails from people asking that they have an opportunity to speak with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| and to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| And so I'm going to go ahead with sending it on without a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| because I want to spend these next few days to do just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| to give these people an opportunity to talk with me because I've told them I would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| And so for me to cast a vote today, again, it's not binding until next Monday anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| So I just wanted to say that I will support sending it on without a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| so I have an opportunity to meet with these folks and just hear what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| There's your one vote, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Mr. Law Director, then it's acceptable for us to do this without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| Would it also be acceptable for us to do 26 without recommendation and just take it up Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| It's anything the pleasure of this board wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| Like I said, this one is an administrative snafu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| and it's entirely up to this body and you're going to deal with it final on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| however you want it to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| I suppose I'll just go ahead and speak right now to my issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| and that is I think the RFP process was appropriately done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| and I don't have any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| I would like for this body to also consider another option, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| and even though the school surpluses property, saying effectively that they have no use for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| I still consider personally I think it's at least worth a very thorough investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3151)|
| 0:52:40| the schools continuing to use it as an administrative facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| I think it's widely known that the schools are going to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| or have certainly considered moving their administrative function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| We've had such things as space issues that may not be adequate in Old Knoxville High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3176)|
| 0:53:06| or for whatever reason, lots of objections apparently from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| But I just still think that if we could get the appropriate people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| the right people in the room together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| and that would be certainly Mayor Burchett and Mayor Rojero and Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3200)|
| 0:53:28| if we could get those people in the room serious about this, seriously considering this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| I just don't see why it shouldn't be considered and investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| Fifty thousand square feet in Old Knoxville High is a lot of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| There's a hundred thousand people that work for IBM that have no offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| And we live in an age today where everyone has an office in their pocket or in their briefcase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3230)|
| 0:53:59| And so some of these objections, you know, other objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| I think with the right people we might be able to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| And I think we certainly should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Some good points, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| All right. We have a motion before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| substitute motion to pass on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Commissioner Burroughs votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| Commissioner Norman votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Commissioner Ornby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Commissioner Ornby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Commissioner Briggs votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Commissioner Anders is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Commissioner Brown votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Commissioner Hammond votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Commissioner Shouse votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| Substitute motion passes 8-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| Okay, item 25 is a resolution determining the method of disposal of property located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| at 7128 Tazewell Park to be by public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| This is the, I assume, the old convenience center on Tazewell Pike as you approach Harbison's Crossroads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| the intersection of Tazewell Pike and Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| And this is a lot easier situation to talk about, apparently, than the one that was just in front of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3351)|
| 0:56:02| There's no concern about the 2.88 acres of that convenience center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3362)|
| 0:56:10| It should be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| We in Knox County have, someone has said, more than 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| We probably have thousands of pieces of county liability that need to be discharged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3377)|
| 0:56:27| in other words, placed in someone else's ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| We recognize that with the mulch facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| We've done several others that have been major and had a lot of impact, maybe, a lot of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3393)|
| 0:56:43| We have the one with the historic Knoxville High School being a major concern, what's going to happen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| But this is housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| It says for the purchasing department to use this particular method to try to remove it from county ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3412)|
| 0:57:01| into ownership by some private citizen in Knox County or private citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| Let me put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Maybe someone in California will view it as a nice place to retire to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| But it would be paying taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| But that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Commissioner Brown does comment that it will be in private citizen's hand and will give us some property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3438)|
| 0:57:28| which I think might be the intention of some of the commission as we discuss the old Knoxville High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3448)|
| 0:57:37| being in private ownership and generating tax funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| The reason that I pause this for just a moment to speak about this is because there are thousands of other pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| of property that need to change hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| And if one by one, like this one, I have to bring them, I'll bring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| And I hope that everyone will agree that one of the processes by which this can be transferred is through public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3476)|
| 0:58:05| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| We'll be using the new middle school there, 12 stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| All right, we have a motion and probably a second on the floor for the approval of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| Any other discussion? Hearing none, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3495)|
| 0:58:23| Item number 26 is a resolution approving an agreement of selling the amount of $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| for Southeastern Housing Foundation II, Inc., for property located at 101 East 5th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| also known as the historic Knoxville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| Agreement does not require the expenditure of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| This is resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to move that we defer this for 30 days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| We have a motion to defer for 30 days and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| I would like to give the people, we've got five people here that have come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| and I definitely want to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| They've taken the time to come today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| So I would like to hear, I think we owe it to them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| In no particular order, Joe Petrie, I've got a Joe Petrie here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| Joe, would you like to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Or you can wait until next month, whatever you want to do, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3558)|
| 0:59:28| My name is Joe Petrie, Conversion Properties, 520 West Summit Hill, the Langley Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3568)|
| 0:59:37| I've been a downtown developer for many years now, and I own Conversion Properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| and have worked in downtown and commercial real estate for about 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| I have no financial involvement with Southeast Housing Foundation or Family Pride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| but I am here to speak on behalf of their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| And you stole my thunder just a little bit because I was here to talk about how fair the process was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3602)|
| 1:00:10| And so delaying that seems to kind of thwart that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| I'm not exactly sure what the reason would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| You've had a public forum at least last night, and you've had a good RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| I think it's important for the development community that when you have a process, you follow that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| It gives us developers something we can depend on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| We need to know that we can depend on government to go through a good, sound process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| I think that's what you did already in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| and apparently there's a little snafu, as the law director says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| and those things happen and technical glitches happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| But I believe that you did vote to go forward with a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| You haven't approved that process yet, but it seemed to be implied that you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| And then the county did the RFP, and you received what you asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| You had good proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| The scoring was deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| It was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| It seems that it always is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| I commend the purchasing department for doing good processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| I've been involved in those processes before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I think they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| When you deny a particular proposal that wins, what do we do with the process then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| What do we do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Is it to pick one over another or maybe an alternative proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| When you decided to sell the property, it seemed like that decision was already made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| And if you go picking a different proposal or if you pick even a different process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| then you're denying your own process that you set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| On behalf of Southeast Housing Foundation, I've been on their board for five or six years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| and I'm getting to know Family Pride better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| But this is a good partnership that's been put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| They complied with the studies that they saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| East Tennessee Design Center did a good study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| They did their own market survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| They're proposing independent living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| That's an underserved community in our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| One thing that's been really important in downtown, and it's been that we've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| I think the way downtown has been served well is that it's become everybody's downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| Back in the nine counties, one vision process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| that was something that really came out strongly was that this is for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| that everybody in the nine-county region sees downtown as the hub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| So it's important that that's a hub for all community groups, all constituencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3770)|
| 1:02:57| They're proposing to pay not only something for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| but more than the county appraisal for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| And that was an independent appraisal, not just the tax appraisal from the assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| The county appraisal even noted that independent living was one of the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| and highest uses for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| It also noted some concerns by one of the other proposers that they could meet the market rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| that have been set in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| And so affordable housing is very important if we are going to say that downtown is for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| This developer is highly qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Each partner has developed specifically old schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| If you drive to Oakwood School today, which was the same kind of process, it's looking great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| looks like it's going to be a great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| Southeast Housing Foundation did Flinnegan School, same kind of process, did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| It's thriving today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Again, I would submit that the process is fair, the scoring is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| And you know that you have to do a fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| That's what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| That's what you do as government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| That's what you do as county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| I do think it's unfair that the community sometimes puts you in the middle of deciding between two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| or three things or whatever the number is when you've already decided to go through a fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| I would also note the use and the nostalgia of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| There's something about the idea of independent living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| senior citizens living in a facility where they maybe once attended high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3874)|
| 1:04:41| I'm sure the other proposers have good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| I know their ideas are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| I know they've got strong success in the downtown community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| But, again, I would point to the process and say it was fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| and I think that going forward we need to stick to those processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| I would just point out that downtown sometimes feels like a bit of a monopoly game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| and that we're trying to, if we've got boardwalk, we also want park place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| And maybe we want this one over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| We want Virginia Avenue or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| But it's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| It's really a very eclectic community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| Having worked here for so long, I was here when we did roll up the streets at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| Some people want to ask you some questions, if you can entertain some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| Can I finish just one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| You've really gone over the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| Just wrap up in ten seconds, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| Well, I would just say that they won through the fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| They're paying more than appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| It serves an underserved community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| And, again, what do you do with the process if you don't follow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| I'd be glad to entertain questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| I did not mention that you had five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| That's my fault there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Commissioner Brewer, I think you're allowed to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| I didn't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| And I wanted to reassure you that my request to postpone this had nothing to do with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| It was absolutely a very fair, straightforward, well-done process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| The issue that I had speaking with my constituents was that not everyone felt like they had adequate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| There's a lot of neighborhood organizations around this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| Not all of them have had time to vet this proposal and discuss it and see how they feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| And so the request for time was really for them, to give them an opportunity to study what's before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| And also, unfortunately, there's been – it's all happened so quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| there's been some misinformation that's gone out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| We want some time to correct that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| and make sure that everyone has the right information moving forward with this next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| So it's no reflection on the process at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| I'm very pleased that the process was done impeccably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| So I just wanted to set your mind at ease about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| I accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Commissioner Ruff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| After all the speakers, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| I just wanted to add a little bit to what Amy said about why I think we need to postpone this for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| You know, first of all, I think it's to allow the community, the citizens in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| to learn more about what is involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| And I was at the public hearing they had last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| It also gives the people that live over there, and Rick Dover was very, very nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| and he and Grant Rosenberg did a very good presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| But it gives them a chance to make modifications on what would make it more acceptable to the citizens before we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| And we may also want to put some restrictions in the deed on this in the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| because once Family Pride has bought out Southeast, you know, the development part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4066)|
| 1:07:58| is that then there's no deed restrictions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| And this could go from housing into some sort of supported housing, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| which may not be agreeable to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| We may want to put some conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| But it just gives the neighborhood and the neighbors the opportunity to put more input into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| no matter which way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| I mean, we can vote this process down and start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| But even if we keep what we have, then we can put some conditions on it that would be agreeable both to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| and make it more acceptable to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Just one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| This gentleman said that this was done on the same process as Flinnegan, which it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| because Flinnegan was totally a supportive housing project, and this is not supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| And also my question is, what was the appraised value on this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4131)|
| 1:08:59| I believe it was 490,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| Or 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| 410,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| Have all spoken that we're going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| Not to the public, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Next I have here, and I say in no particular order, Tommy Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| And, Tommy, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| Good afternoon, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| My name is Tommy Spencer, 6831 Adriana Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| and I'm also president and managing partner for Senior Home Assistance in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| And we're proudly located in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| But I'm here to speak about the Knoxville high school proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| I'm pleased and honored to serve many families who need and desire and need independent living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4185)|
| 1:09:54| We find that our waiting lists for these kinds of homes are increasingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| and many times the indigent die before they're able to even acquire these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| And we have to care for these generations, the teachers, the firemen, police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| even the lunchroom ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| These people are responsible for who we are today, and it's our turn to care for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| And I think the best way to do that is provide a safe and secure environment for them to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| And that's why I'm totally for this proposal to turn the Knoxville high school around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4223)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Next up, I had a Judith Neff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| Ms. Neff, is she still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| Thank you, Judith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Judith Neff, 811 Gratz in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4243)|
| 1:10:49| I'm the current president of the Board of Directors of Fourth and Gill Neighborhood Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| And I just want to be on the record saying we very much need more time to understand this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4254)|
| 1:11:03| In the four years I've been on the board, I don't think we've ever had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| or I have ever had more requests for time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| And there may be some frustrations and disagreements on what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| but mostly people are showing that they don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| And I'm sorry that you all have had to work so hard trying to do the best you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| with financial restraints and trying to protect historic property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| But 2013, you've got your office in your pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| You also have eight ways to communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| And I think people just get lost in the snowstorm of messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| We at least need more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| I thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| Thank you, Ms. Neff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Next up I had a Sam McKamey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4317)|
| 1:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| I'm Sam McKamey, McKamey Development, 124 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| And I'm a business owner in the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| and I'm very familiar with Family Pride and some of their projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| And I just came down to support them as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| And I've got some buildings and apartments down on the 100 block and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| And I just want to support the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| It sounds like the process was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| And as a developer, you know, we've got to rely on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| what you're telling us like that to do these kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| And I've known Rick a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| and I've actually toured some of his projects where he's allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| and allowed where he had converted an old school to an assisted living project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| And he's also done some stuff and also allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| He did another one that was actually a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| And he's doing a hotel in Oak Ridge, and he's also doing the Oakwood school thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| So I just think I'm not really familiar with the whole process or who else did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4389)|
| 1:13:17| but I just would support him and also the independent living thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| Because being on the 100 block, I tell you what, it's really fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| There's lots of young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| It's really fun being around the young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| And I love downtown and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| But I'm also going to like it when I'm old too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| So it would be great to have something like that for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you, Mr. McKinney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| Next we have Marlene Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4423)|
| 1:13:51| Name and address for the record, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| Yes, my name is Marlene Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| I live at 1935 Cherokee Boulevard, city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| I'm here to support the Family Pride proposal for the use of the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| I think we need a diversity of residential options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| with a diversity of income levels and support levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| I commend you all for thinking about this reuse of the high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| in a way that opens it up for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| Many of you may know me as a University of Tennessee professor of architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| You may remember I was active and co-chair of Downtown Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Nine Counties, One Vision, and longtime advocate for downtown living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| I'm on the board of the Community Design Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| and I was recently the co-chair of that symposium that we had called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| Ageless Downtowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| It was a four-hour symposium, and we brought two national experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| and I encountered Family Pride when we put together a panel discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| of local experts to talk about how national trends affect us locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| And Ageless Downtowns was talking about diversifying urban residential options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| and how walkable downtown neighborhoods, any neighborhood that's walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| is an ideal location for seniors and people as they get older and slower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| to stay active and walk and, you know, decentralize your amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| We had 192 people come to the symposium, RSVPs and walk-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| We had a show, which was quite remarkable for four hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| a show of hands, one-third were downtown residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| one-third were outside of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| and then one-third, by process of elimination, were Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| So I think there was, like, a diversity of interest in just the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| of downtown living for a diversity of age groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| For this particular process with the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| many great examples of renovating high schools for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| Just want to emphasize that we're looking at independent living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| which means people are walking, they're out and about, they have visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| they have families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| It's going to energize the neighborhood and help diversify the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| Again, I want to thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you for making the great building available for quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| And I think that Family Pride represents quality development with a lot of know-how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| in a niche market where you do need expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| They have a good track record with, you know, senior-level housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| as well as with historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Good thing to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Commissioner Brown, do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Not for this lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| I want to have a question for the developer when we get to that, after we heard all of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| That's for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| That's everybody that wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| I think they need to put this out there because we've heard three things today, subsidized housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| we've heard assisted living, we've heard low-income housing, we've heard whatever, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| So can somebody tell us exactly what type of housing is being proposed for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4624)|
| 1:17:12| This may open up the conversation for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4632)|
| 1:17:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| I'm Rick Dover, 2018 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| I'm employed by Family Pride Corporation as a general manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| and we are the proposer along with Southeastern Housing for Knoxville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4648)|
| 1:17:36| What we're proposing there is a private pay, 100% private pay, independent living for older adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| It basically would be an apartment house for older adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| and as part of that process, the building would contain a number of support services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| that they could option in or out of, including full meal service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| There will be staff there 24-7 if they need anything at night or weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| We'll have transportation wherever they want to go locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| We'll have a full-time concierge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| We'll have people that will run errands and go to the store for them, take them to the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| whatever they want to do that they don't want to go to themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| And we'll have local transportation 24-7 wherever they want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| We'd like to try to separate folks from their personal automobiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| by being able to offer them whatever transportation needs they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| and they would pay one monthly rate, and that rate would include all their utilities, their maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| all the staff that's there, food service, laundry, housekeeping, and local transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| and then a plethora of activities that would happen there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| There would be a full-staffed wellness center there for physical fitness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| as well as a salon and all kinds of activities and entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| and the public would be invited on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| So that would be basically the operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| It would also include preserving the Doughboy statue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| and a total historic preservation of the building in compliance with the Secretary of Interior's standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| because it is a National Register-listed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| Southeastern's involvement with us allows us to do something that's really special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| and we've been doing seniors housing now for 19 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| and I came to it when my grandfather needed care way back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| But the problem we've got is not that there are not a lot of seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| We've got a market study we can hand out today that was done by a national firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| for a five-mile radius of Knoxville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| The unmet need is seven times the units that we're proposing within the income brackets that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| The problem we've got for seniors is not can we make a great building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| or can we do a great service for them and give them everything that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| Yes, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| The problem is people are outliving their money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| and so to make it reasonable for these folks to live there and for their families is a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| What really is unique and wonderful about the possibility of doing Knoxville High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| is that Southeastern is a 501c3 nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| We are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| They're eligible to receive a community investment tax credit financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| a 4% below prime mortgage, which effectively today would be virtually a 0% mortgage rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4804)|
| 1:20:12| When we look at our components of expenses in operating senior facilities, senior living facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| the interest we pay on our mortgage is our second highest expense, only exceeded by staff salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| So in this particular case, we'll be able to lower our occupancy costs profile by approximately 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4823)|
| 1:20:31| and we're pledging to pass that savings along to our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| and to the residents that live there through this community investment tax credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Well, okay, what strings come with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| Well, it's totally private pay for the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| It's totally market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| We could charge whatever we wanted, and the folks that live there can have whatever asset base they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| That's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| There would be a cutoff on 80% of the county median income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| which for a single-person household is $34,000, $35,000 a year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| and for a two-person household would be about $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| Well, I went back and checked all our records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| and we take care of more seniors in independent living and assisted living and Alzheimer's care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| than anybody in the greater Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| And we don't have anybody that wouldn't qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| I mean, we have folks that have million-dollar houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| and millions of dollars in CDs or bonds or stocks or whatever, but they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| Their incomes, by definition, these folks are all retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| They're all on Social Security or maybe a small pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| They have some supplementary income from whatever their investments may hopefully provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| or maybe they have a house that they want to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| But that would not preclude them from living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| So we don't take care of anybody that wouldn't meet those qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| So to call this a low-income project is really a misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| That's like labeling all seniors as low-income people because they don't have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| They can't go out and work like all of us can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| So it's a way that we've got some advantages given the partnership that's involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| and the historic nature of the building and the fact that it's municipally owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| and the fact that you're considering the possibility of allowing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| to become a very interesting, beautiful, and diverse living facility for older adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| This is one of those few opportunities to do a transaction like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| We've been doing this 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| This is only the fifth or sixth one that we've seen in almost 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| that all these lines converge to where something like this could be a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| So that's basically, in a nutshell, what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| One final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| And probably you're going to have to find out from Dr. McIntyre where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| but my high school along with some others, from what I've been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| that was the repository for all of the memorabilia from those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| What's going to happen to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| Well, we have contacted the Alumni Association, which is really still very active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| considering the fact that the last class graduated in 1951.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| But Harvey Sproul, who's the president of the Alumni Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| is someone that I've known for almost 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| and they're very interested in curating a rotating museum of memorabilia within the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4979)|
| 1:23:06| And we will have regular barbecues and potluck suppers and things where everybody will be invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| and the public will still be able to come back to the building for these type of functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| But we hope to have all the old sports trophies back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| We'd like to have all the class pictures of every graduating class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| And they've got all kinds of memorabilia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| They've agreed if we'll make the space available, and we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| to have kind of a rotating ongoing museum to the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| That's only for old Knox Hall, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Well, that's what we're thinking of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| It could be expanded further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| At least four others I can think of that have gone away of the Wild Goose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| That stuff's in boxes somewhere or thrown in the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Well, I think it'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| I mean, considering how important and what an icon that building is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| if we had rural high reminiscence October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| and then maybe we have some of the other ones down the road, that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| as well as the return of the Knox High Trojans, I think that'd be pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| We'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| You know, we did have a very active discussion last night at the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| chaired by Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| And, you know, I listened carefully to what people said and what their concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| And, frankly, I think what we ought to do, and I'm going to offer this today on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| is that on our dime we'll hold a number of neighborhood design charrettes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| and there's some very talented architects who own property right across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| on both two different sides from this facility, Dwayne Greve and John Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| And I'm going to ask both of them if they would come and be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| And we'll take the public input and listen to what folks' concerns might be for the design of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| and make sure that we get as much of it right as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| We're probably not going to be able to please absolutely everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| but, you know, we're certainly willing to give it a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Mr. Mayor, just a quick question on what Commissioner Brown was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| How much space are you looking at donating for alumni for Old Knoxville High?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| Well, kind of whatever it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Commissioner Smith, I'm not sure how much they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| I don't think it'll be so much floor space as wall space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| And, obviously, there are a lot of big, long, tall corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| That building's got 14-foot wide corridors all through it with 14-foot ceilings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| With your design, you could still have your people upstairs, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| and still have the first floor just full of memorabilia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| and maybe possibly rotate some other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| Big room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| I don't think that would be any problem whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| I mean, we're going to use all the floor space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| and we're not really planning on taking down any structural walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| and we intend to work with what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| It's really old schools are a very, very compatible partner for what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5152)|
| 1:25:59| I wish there were more of them that were available along the lines that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| And the other ones that we've done, for instance, in Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| we took the original Loudoun County-Lenore City High School, which was built in 1908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| It's actually a little bit older than this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| but had the same architect, Bowman & Bowman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| and acquired that building from the city on an RFP with deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| and it's now been in operations for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| We've remodeled it three or four different times, getting ready to update it again now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| They're very compatible for this type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| So, yes, I think we can make whatever space is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| We'll make it available for whatever the need is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Well, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Just on Commissioner Burroughs, I'll get right with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| We're talking memorabilia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| While you're here, if it cannot, what Commissioner Brown was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| you've got other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| If you see that you cannot, if you happen to get to it, if you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| I would ask whoever gets this, you cannot use all that memorabilia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| that you turn it back over to the school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| That just doesn't go to the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| Somebody gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Somebody needs to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| We're talking stuff well over 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| I mean, we think they're, you know, very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| And think about it from our standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| I mean, what better marketing tool would we have to attract folks that went to school there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| or that taught there to come back that, you know, all this is there for them to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| to enjoy and to bring their friends back in and family and, you know, old trophies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| and, you know, letter sweaters, all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| I think we can have a ball doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| For the first several months, that was several of my calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| several of my calls from people, the alumni, saying, you know, they want to keep their stuff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Did you get your question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Because if you have to split hairs to call this a subsidized deal, in my opinion, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| if you 80% of the prevailing rate, without that, Rick, does it get the tax credits, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| And I went to the meeting last night, and Commissioner Burroughs did a good job of chairing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| And it was controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| I mean, we heard some very opposing viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| And there's without question in my snapshot of what I saw last night and what the e-mails I've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| it seems to be their surrounding area, the people who live closest by, would prefer the Dewhurst proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5284)|
| 1:28:12| I mean, that's just what they belong about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| That's what it sounds like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| And they advocated for that last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| And I compliment you on giving us or proposing some more hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| And I would certainly support this motion for a deferral to allow some of that, to allow more public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| And I learned a lot last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| I knew it was not a Section 8, but you may emphatically let it be known it was not a Section 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| as Gabby Love behind it, I assume, is probably one, or Summit Towers is probably one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| It's not a men villa, which is just a couple of blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| There's a lot of fear of an extension of CARM and voluntary ministries and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| This is just a victim of geography, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| And it was debated last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| If it were a block or two the other way, then it probably would not be the big issue that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| If you remove the building, we'd still buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| You mentioned that last night, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Nevertheless, I totally support an extension on this so we can have some more public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5352)|
| 1:29:19| And if you are generous enough to put together some design meetings or whatever, I'll certainly try to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5359)|
| 1:29:28| I enjoyed it last night and learned a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| and I hope the majority of the Commission will entertain the thought of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| I wanted to thank everyone who came out last night to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| It was interesting, and I hope it was informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| But this is, I think, the two biggest hurdles that I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| One is the misinformation, and none of it has been intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| But in light of what has been put in my district in years past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| people would naturally jump to the conclusion that this might be subsidized housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| or Section 8 housing or some kind of public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| And this is absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| This is private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| It's an apartment building for senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| It's affordable housing, which is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| It's not, I just can't stress that enough, that it's not subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| It's not Section 8 housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| And because of the deed restrictions we can put on, it would never be a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| It would never be permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| It would never be any of those things that we feel like we're overloaded with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| The other issue that I see is there is a difference of opinion on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5447)|
| 1:30:57| seniors are great, but younger people are going to be better neighbors in terms of getting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| and being outside in the neighborhood and walking and biking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| and spending money in the surrounding businesses and restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5467)|
| 1:31:14| And I think that there's just going to have to be a difference of opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| I don't necessarily agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| But I think those are the two biggest hurdles we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| are just a lack of understanding about what kind of development this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| and whether or not seniors are appropriate neighbors for that part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| So I'm hoping that that's what we can have more discussion about over the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| And I hope anyone who has any questions will continue to contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| Please contact all of the commissioners and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| I'm sure people can contact you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Thank you, Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Hugh Holt, if you'll come just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| We've heard some talk about the process, and that's what's holding us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| We have a substitute motion before us to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| but go into the process just real quick and talk about why you think we should vote today versus if we should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5527)|
| 1:32:15| Well, obviously that is whether you vote or not is completely up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| I will say that the committee did a very thorough job in vetting the issues between proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5541)|
| 1:32:29| You had three very good proposals, all with their respective merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5549)|
| 1:32:36| But at the end of the day, it came out the way it was supposed to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| And the highest evaluated proposer was given an award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| And past that, I really don't have any comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5571)|
| 1:33:05| We have a motion on the floor to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| We'll postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| Next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Oh, look, do you want to take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| I think Mr. Brown is about to bust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5600)|
| 1:33:30| As soon as you can, we're ready to continue moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5610)|
| 1:34:09| Any commissioners out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5649)|
| 1:34:17| We're ready to play ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| We have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Clerk, call the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| This is on page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| Item number 29 is a resolution approving a contract with the Federal Signal Safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| and Security Systems for an emergency mass notification system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| Cost is $29,768.10 for the first year and $17,666.24 for subsequent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5679)|
| 1:34:49| First year funded in current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| This is resolution 806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| First and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| Commissioner Hammond, you have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| Yes, I wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| We have a representative from Federal Signal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5701)|
| 1:35:11| Did you name and address for the record, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| Andrew LeVon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| I'm from 7949 Stateline Avenue in Munster, Indiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| Thank you so much for being here and for submitting this bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| This has been a process of about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| We talked about the idea of doing sirens a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| and found out that the technology has been much improved since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| and there's a lot of things on the marketplace now to provide this early warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| As we look at what happened in Oklahoma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| and as we look at what has happened in other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| we know that in times of tornadoes and other types of weather emergencies, minutes count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| And so this type of early warning system, while new to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| is not new to other communities, and some of the communities in Oklahoma had this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| and they know that when they had like a 14-minute warning before the tornado hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| lives actually were saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| So can you run down for us exactly how this system works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| how our people will be able to take advantage of it once it's up and going and implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| In a nutshell, from a high level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| we're going to provide you with a mass notification system that allows you to quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| and effectively disseminate information that is extremely accurate and extremely timely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| as Commissioner Hammond pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| So you'll be able to disseminate this information to your citizens via a number of different methods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| most notably via phone calls, text messages over the Internet through social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| as well as over pagers, home phones, e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| So you'll be able to reach folks in a number of different methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| to make sure that that message is delivered to them in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| so that whether they don't hear their cell phone or perhaps they're not at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| it's able to get to them through one means or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| Now this will be voluntary, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Citizens will have the option of doing this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| Yes, it will be on a completely voluntary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| So it will be we'll create a website for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| It will have the branding of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| and citizens can go on and enroll their own information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| It can be their home phone, their own cell phone, their children's cell phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| whatever information they want to provide, their address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| It's completely voluntary, so there won't be any enrollment on the part of Federal Signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| We'll set up, we'll give you the tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| we'll train the people that will be using the system on how to use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| and then the citizens, it will be up to them to enroll on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| Now this will be through the 911 Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| The administration of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Assuming that this is approved, when do you see it up and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| and ready for people to start opting in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| Because it is software-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| it's going to be a much quicker rollout than the traditional deployment of sirens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| where you have to go and put a stick in the ground and get approval and then build the siren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| From the time that it is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| we would like to have it up and running in a month's time frame, I'd say no more than two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| It just depends on the availability of our project managers once the approval has been given to us to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| And because it is software-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| do you have people available 24-7 to answer questions if there's any snafus, snags, that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| Yes, 24-7, 365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| We have Federal Signal employees available for any questions, snafus, anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| Even if you needed us to initiate a message, we would be able to do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| Now the other aspect to this, too, is that it can be area-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| So, in other words, if there's an area where there is a need to send out messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| it may not go out to all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| That determination would be made by the 9-1-1 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| But it might be just area-specific so that people in the area would know if there was some type of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| Yes, you're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Included with our proposal is our module called Geosphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| which allows that geographic targeting of specific areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| So through the 9-1-1 center, if there was a chemical spill, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| they can target this to just the folks that would be affected or in the prevailing winds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| so that you don't have to panic the whole population, alert folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| and get them out of bed if it doesn't pertain to them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Well, thank you, and I want to thank Mayor Burchett for putting this in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| and you for bidding, and we're looking forward to getting this in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| Okay, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Seeing none, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| On page 9, item number 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| this is a resolution approving an amendment to the Knoxville South Waterfront redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| and urban renewal plan containing previous related to the tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| authorizes the use of tax increment financing in connection with the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| of the former Baptist Hospital site in the amount not to seek $22 million for a period not to seek 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| This is resolution 807.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| Excuse me, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| Before we make a motion, I'd like to disclose I am on the board for Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| I receive no income from Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| I will continue to process this, but I will not speak, take any action on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| I recognize all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| I recognize Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| I really have the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| I'm going to recuse myself completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| I'm not going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| I take a recusal very seriously because it means that people don't have a voice that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| but I do work at a Tenova hospital, and I do receive reimbursement from Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| and they are the owners of the Baptist Hospital, so I'm going to be out of this completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| I heard a first from Commissioner Brules and a second from Commissioner Brown to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6046)|
| 1:40:54| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| I see Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| I also work for Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| Just see if you all are listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| Mark, 22 million, I looked at the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| I couldn't tell what city and what county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| Is there a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| Is that a dumb question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| No, it's not a dumb question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| I'm Mark Mamentoff yet again, and I'm at 1215.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| I'm still at 1215 Great Oaks Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| And just to be clear, I serve as bond counsel when they close these TIF financings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6085)|
| 1:41:32| and normally you don't see my ugly face at these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| but I helped write the original South Waterfront plan because I was most familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| They asked if I would come answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| To answer your question, Commissioner Shouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| unlike most of these plans, you do not segregate the city and county taxes per payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| and so the entire amount, 22 million, would be secured by both the increment from the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| and there's no segregation of the principal amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| The whole deal is 165 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| The TIF 22, the bank construction financing, 114,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| and the owners putting in about 28.6 of equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| And would the --- like would this go off as a tax-free bond that some private bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6138)|
| 1:42:27| or city group or JP Morgan or somebody would buy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Typically in the early stages of development like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| the TIF financing is usually sold as an adjunct ancillary to the construction financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| Until a development like this is completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| and is really producing the property taxes that you project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| it's almost impossible to sell a TIF like this to anybody except for the construction lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| They almost always will require guarantees from the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| We, in fact, have the developer right here, Mark Sinn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| Rhodes Seeger, and Tommy Saul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| They'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| But almost always in the early years of these TIFs you'll have a developer guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| The developer guarantee keeps you from being able to do tax-exempt debt in the early years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| A goal for a lot of these TIFs, and it's good for the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| is to roll them out eventually tax-exempt once the guarantee can burn off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| and there's plenty of coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| And the reason it's good is it'll lower the interest rate by a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| and the TIF can get paid off faster and the taxes can start going back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| Go back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| But it can go 40 years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| The original plan allowed it to go to 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| The purpose of this amendment, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| is to specifically segregate the old Baptist Hospital site for the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| But the original plan allowed it to go to 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| Since that plan was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| there was a bill called the Tax Increment Uniformity Act that I worked a lot on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| that shortened the TIFs for redevelopment projects to 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| for redevelopment-type activities like this, blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| and then to 20 years for like South Grove, the Chapman Highway one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| And so unless you go to the comptroller and ask for a longer period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| you're limited to 20 years for that type and 30 years for this type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| The comptroller felt that the 30-year was a much better fit for redevelopment projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| where before you could go up to 40 years, which is what the current plan allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| So this is actually shortening up maturity from what you have right now in the redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| I think the shorter the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| And just sort of one final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| The KCDCs referenced, I know KCDCs in this deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| would these be KCDC tax-exempt bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| Would not be tax-exempt, at least initially, but it would be a KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| We typically close these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| It's called a tax increment note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| It's usually typically bought by a bank as a taxable note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| And the goal for all these developers is usually after four or five years to see if you can get the guarantee to roll off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6288)|
| 1:44:59| and then you can, again, go tax-exempt and lower the interest rate at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| So KCDC would be the issuer of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| And that is a really important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| Neither the county nor the city are on the hook for this debt in any way whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| The sole liability of both the city and county is to allocate the incremental tax revenues to the KCDC so it can pay off the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6315)|
| 1:45:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| I just wanted to, and Chris gave us a sheet here as I started to ask you questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| probably has a lot of the answers of the questions I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| I certainly support it, and I think it's a great use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| Well, I think I'm happy with what's happening across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| It sat there as an eyesore quite a while, and I think this is a good use for TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| We've had some controversy on some of them in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| and I know some of my colleagues have voted against a few of them that were primarily for retail, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| and I think some of the retails we saw just a Walmart out somewhere was certainly a stretch for TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| but I think this is a great use for it and plan to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| But thanks for the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| I'm one of those colleagues that traditionally vote against these type of TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6366)|
| 1:46:14| Question, I guess, for the developer, and this is just a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| When you're done with it, why so dense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| So I don't know who would like to approach that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| It just seems to be extremely dense concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| You know, because, again, I'm looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| Forget about what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| I know there's a lot of buildings there, but when we're done, it just still seems to have a real dense feel to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6401)|
| 1:46:48| and South Knoxville is not a dense place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| So it seems to be kind of out of character for this multi-use facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| My name is Mark Senn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| I'm with Blanchard and Calhoun, who is the developer of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| Your address, for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| 2743 Perimeter Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| That's Augusta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| You know, I think when we started looking at the project, the first thing that we did was we designed the Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6434)|
| 1:47:24| And the second thing we designed was the public space, which is a public event terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| And those things fit first, and then everything around it evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| You know, you have a 600-space parking deck that we're keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| You have a 178,000-foot office building that we're keeping, and we're converting to a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| And you have two office buildings that are 40,000 feet and 30,000 feet that we're keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6465)|
| 1:47:53| And then the old hospital is coming down, and the old hotel, volunteer hotel, is coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6473)|
| 1:48:00| And then this place is things that are going back that are less dense than what was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| I mean, like our multifamily is five stories on one side, three stories on the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| where now you have a building that's nine stories, eight stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| So, you know, I think to me it fits the scale, if you will, of 22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6495)|
| 1:48:24| You know, you could argue one way or the other about the density of it, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| but I think we feel like we have more than adequate parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| We think we have more than adequate green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| You know, the Riverwalk before was proposed to be out in the water because no one ever thought this would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| So now it's at the top where a lot of people can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| It's actually on the top edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| It will have a nice overlook and a vent terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| All of it will be public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| All will be owned by a public entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| And so, you know, we've tried to kind of do a balance between that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| what it takes to make it work monetarily, and what we can create in public space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| And we've done that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| And it's a tight project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| I mean, there's a lot of demolition that has to take place on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| Extremely amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| There's a lot of environmental remediation that has to be done on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| And there's a lot of money associated with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| So with that comes you have to put it back in use in something that can give you economic return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| So I think we've tried to balance it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| And like I said, we first started off by figuring out what the public space is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| and working a lot through that process with the city in terms of the Riverwalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| and also the terrace and everything that we're doing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| and kind of working through the overall plans for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| So we tried to keep it in scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| So I'll have to admit I did not see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| Are there any road improvements in that general vicinity that you're planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| In addition to the Riverwalk, in addition to the public terrace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| part of the money that you're seeing that's going to the TIF, that's some of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| A good bit of the money is going for the Riverwalk and the terrace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| but also Blount Avenue improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| There's a proposed roundabout that's been shown for years coming off the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6614)|
| 1:50:21| And then we've hired a traffic engineer right now to study how to make, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| Blount Avenue more pedestrian friendly and also maybe how to set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| Does it have a median?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| How to do the landscaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| How to do the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| There's a lot of biking and stuff that's going on along the Riverwalk as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| and linking that with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| So part of the efforts are going to be, and part of the money that's proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| is going to be going for the roadway improvements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| You know, I like to say on this project that there's a lot of good things that the public is going to see through this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| and it's beneficial to our project as well, like the Riverwalk and the terrace and the Blount Avenue improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6659)|
| 1:51:06| But you have to have a way to pay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| And the way to pay for them is to do the project at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| because this project will pay for those public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| Without this project, it would be difficult to do the millions and millions of dollars of public improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| that's going to have to take place in this area to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| And it's on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| You know, like I say, I am generally opposed to these, but I have endorsed a couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| You know, the one there at the old Fulton Bellows Place as well as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| I don't know if they've done off of White Road, but not a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| But this is one I do agree, this is blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| This is a, you know, it's an embarrassment for the city in terms of, you know, a great piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6704)|
| 1:51:53| Difficult, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Very difficult piece of property, but it's a great setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| And, you know, I say good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| I still wish, you know, maybe you didn't retain all of those structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| but I understand dollars and cents as well, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| it's kind of hard to rebuild a five-story office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| So, you know, I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| So good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| I really hope this, you pull this off to a conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| and we end up with a great piece of property just south of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| Thanks for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6747)|

| 1:55:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| Item number 42 is spread of record, the Knox County Mayor's appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| reappointment to serve on the Knox County Ethics Committee for a four-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| term expiring October 31, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| I guess the point of order, I guess we can't spread this record until we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| have, I know we don't vote on it, but we need a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| So we'll probably just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| Yeah, these you should just send on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| That recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Yeah, until, just let them be read at the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| We should have the names by next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| Is that your motion, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Well, I don't think we can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| It's not a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Let's move to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Item 43 is spread of record, the Knox County Mayor's appointment of Dean Rice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| to serve as a non-voting liaison to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| Don't move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| There's no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| Spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| We had some discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| Go ahead and read it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| Item 44 is also appointment of to serve in the remainder of Commissioner Richard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| Briggs' term on the Knox County Board of Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| a term which expires October 31, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| That's again we redirected Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| Then we had some discussion items real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| The first one is discussion of the court reporter from the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7018)|
| 1:57:08| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| Over the last couple of three months, because of the uproar that we've had there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| I started attending these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| and I found out that we are paying for a court reporter at Dr. Corsello's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7041)|
| 1:57:29| to take minutes of those meetings when we have at least one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| and sometimes two of our court ladies that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| They take minutes for us at every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| I talked to Foster on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| He said it's a total duplication of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| and last year we paid out $5,200 and change for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| And I will have a motion, resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| whatever it takes to go on next Monday to stop that immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| Yeah, I can answer that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| Actually, it's not a complete duplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| If you look at the minutes that the clerk's office takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| and compare them with what we get from the court reporter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| the court reporter is every single word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| It's a complete word-by-word transcript rather than just general notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| And the reason that Dr. Corsello asked to start doing that was because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| when the Audit Committee was making recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| trying to make recommendations to Mr. Walls of how he needed to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7107)|
| 1:58:33| or things that he needed to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| we would come back the next month and it would be like it hadn't even been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| So having it a word-for-word transcript was our way of saying, yes, it was addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7120)|
| 1:58:47| Yes, we did ask for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| And that was not possible with just the general, generic notes that we got from the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| So that was why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| You were asking why, and I'm just giving you an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| If I were in these two ladies' shoes up here and I knew somebody was taking down word-for-word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| I wouldn't worry about taking word-for-word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| But I know they do a good job and have for years and years for us on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| This is a whole lot more sensitive and more important body than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| If he wants that court reporter, let him pay for it out of his pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| But I don't think a citizen of Knox County should pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| Commissioner Brown, this was not in any way meant to insult our clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| They do a great job for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| I don't know if you will do a comparison of what they do compared to what the court reporter did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| What we needed was a word-for-word transcript, which is not what the clerk's office does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| Did you not hear what I just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| I was trying to respond to you because it seemed like you weren't listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| You said they do word-for-word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| Why should they do word-for-word when she's doing word-for-word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| They give us what we need for the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| If you want a word-for-word, they can give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| They tape it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| They can give you a word-for-word if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| They do it for the commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| Let me jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| My point is, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| You've got it on and you keep it on file, on recording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| if we need to go back and every single word that was said, you've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| We've got it if and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| I think we're trying to compare apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| It's okay on tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| And the encapsulated progress of the meeting is captured in print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7227)|
| 2:00:35| But what I think the Audit Committee was looking for was to see every word in print,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7235)|
| 2:00:41| about in real time, within a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| Now, I was not involved in the discussion of what was being said at the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7245)|
| 2:00:52| and then what might be the verbiage that was then being given at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7252)|
| 2:01:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| I think that's a lot of ancient history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| and I don't know that we need to replow any of that ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| It may be that we, members of the Audit Committee appointed by full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| need to take this as a discussion item to our next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| and respond to Commissioner Brown's request of why should there be a court reporter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7285)|
| 2:01:33| and let us come back and say something at some future meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| if that would be okay with Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7297)|
| 2:01:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| I'm sorry, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| And having said that, I will yield to whatever full commission would like to see us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| Well, I can say that since the main reason that we had the court reporter is no longer a part of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7312)|
| 2:02:01| meaning that Mr. Walls is no longer with us, I don't see why we would need one anymore, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7321)|
| 2:02:08| And to further that just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| that's the reason I was thinking maybe it might be okay for the Audit Committee to express itself back to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7330)|
| 2:02:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| I don't see that that would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| But we have to have Byron over here beside me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| If he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| They can express whatever opinion they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| but still that Audit Committee works under the auspices and direction of this county commission and whatever we say goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7348)|
| 2:02:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| I've said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| You're right, but, I mean, I don't think we as a body need to be too dogmatic about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7359)|
| 2:02:49| It sounds like they had valid reasons at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| You can disagree with me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| I don't really care, but it sounds like they had valid reasons at the time for wanting a word-for-word document to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7375)|
| 2:03:06| whatever case, to build whatever body of work that they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| I would just hate for us, again, we're asking people, whether you like them, dislike them, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| we're asking people to give of their time to go in and do serious work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7396)|
| 2:03:22| Whether you agree with the end product or not, we're asking people to give freely of their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| even our commissioners give freely of their time for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| And I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| They may want the next independent auditor to get an idea of what we expect from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7413)|
| 2:03:40| They may still want a word-for-word document that this person can build their job off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| But what I want to say is I don't want to get too deeply into their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| and so if they, it sounds like at least two of them, feel that, hey, maybe we don't need this anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7432)|
| 2:03:59| I'm sure the body's not going to just spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| We're actually, you know, pretty good about not spending money when we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| But I would rather it come from them as opposed to us in a bully pulpit just because we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7448)|
| 2:04:15| Just because we can doesn't mean that we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| And so I would rather the committee to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| Well, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| You through, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| We'll let you jump back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| I'm going to let you wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| Commissioner Shouse, you had something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| I would just add I wish we would have thought of this a little bit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7473)|
| 2:04:39| Amy's right, and Commissioner Brolls is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| There were some disputes over what was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| He said, she said, we said do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| And it was interpreted as doing something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| And so that's why Dr. Carsello brought that professional reporter in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| I do not see the need for it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| I think these ladies would be more than adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| And I can't imagine us needing to incur that expense additionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| And I'm sorry we didn't think of it at our last audit meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| The audit committee meets the day after next Tuesday, I think, a week from tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| So I can certainly, I'm fine on, I would support not having the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| I think it's somewhat overkill now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| By his own admission, Dr. Carsello came on that audit committee to get rid of Richard Walls, by his own admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7525)|
| 2:05:33| Now, if he needed that record, then he should have paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| But let me tell you this, folks, and Foster Arnett, these ladies right here can verify what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| I went back, I got the last two and a half years, minutes of that court reporter, read them every one, word for word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7543)|
| 2:05:53| Not once in those last, there might have been in the earlier ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| but in the last two and a half years there was not one negative comment about Richard's work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7556)|
| 2:06:03| the quality or the quantity of his work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| Not once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| But he used it as a tool to get rid of Richard because I don't know what his problem was with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7568)|
| 2:06:14| But I'm just telling you that's the fact, Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| I think if the audit committee would just bring that back to us and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| Thank you, Adam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Commissioner Hanlon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7584)|
| 2:06:25| As you know, there was some news reports on Friday with regards to improper arrests in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| I saw Ms. McCroskey was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| I want to give them the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| But also Sheriff Jones is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| And, Sheriff Jones, if I could ask you just a couple of questions about that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7596)|
| 2:06:45| First of all, you're aware of the reports that came out on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| I'm just interested in your comments on those and anything that you would like to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| Well, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| And let me first start off by saying that we take someone's freedom being taken away from them very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7615)|
| 2:07:03| And as it was purported that the sheriff's office had some, that, in fact, is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7623)|
| 2:07:10| We had absolutely nothing committed by the Knox County Sheriff's Office that led to anyone being arrested wrongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7630)|
| 2:07:18| I want to make sure that all you commissioners understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| We had absolutely, we committed absolutely no errors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| As a matter of fact, we went above and beyond what we should have done by checking, even making verbal checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7644)|
| 2:07:31| to find out if warrants were valid and when we were told they were and people were wrongly arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| So we shouldered no blame in these arrests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| Now, to further go on, does that mean we're perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| We make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| When we make mistakes, we correct them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| We don't blame other agencies or other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| We correct them and we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| Could someone tell us what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7676)|
| 2:08:04| There were news reports on Friday from two TV stations talking about the fact that there had been people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| I believe 19 over the last year and a half, that had been arrested improperly in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| And so I just talked with Sheriff Jones about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| He wants to set the record straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| I want to give him the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| Ms. McCroskey was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| I want to give her the opportunity to chat as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| But I just want to get that on the record and give him the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| We have to depend on that paperwork being valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| And that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| And we have the documentation to show that there were no errors committed by the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| if any commissioners would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| I guess in way of comments, I'm assuming, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| that that offer is still valid for Monday if the criminal clerk would like to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7726)|
| 2:08:53| I'd like to hear that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| Thanks, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| That it, ladies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| We will close this meeting and go into our interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| And we had ten applicants, probably all ten are not here, so, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| hopefully you can stay and hear the most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| Let's just jump right into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| We have three positions open, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| Two and then a fill of partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| Two fulls and then a partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| And we have ten applicants here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| As we call out your name, if you will come, and we'll give you five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| You do not have to take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| But if you will talk to us and start with DeWitt Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| DeWitt is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| And these are appointments on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| I'm DeWitt Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| I live at 11207 Crown Point Drive in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| And when I read in the paper a few weeks ago that there were vacancies on the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7813)|
| 2:10:20| and also a brief description there of what the Ethics Committee does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| I thought it matched very closely with work I did with the Tennessee Valley Authority as their first ombudsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7825)|
| 2:10:33| And being retired for five years, I have since spent time helping with my homeowners association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7833)|
| 2:10:40| and have no problem giving back to the public for the county that has served me well for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7840)|
| 2:10:48| and thought that if there was a way that I could help out, I would volunteer to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7848)|
| 2:10:54| And I hope each of you has a copy of the resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| I think you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| And I would be happy to entertain any questions of me that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| Any questions for Mr. DeWitt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| Commissioner Olmby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| I'm going to be the only one, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| I just have one question that really applies to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| Is there anything that will keep you from making at least the majority of the 830 meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| because this committee does meet at 830 in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7881)|
| 2:11:25| I'm retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| I'm flexible on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| The only thing I have is a new two-and-a-half-month-old granddaughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| that I enjoy taking care of every once in a while, but that's a variable schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7891)|
| 2:11:39| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| I'll ask real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| Do you have anybody in your immediate household that works for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| No, they do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| I guess I want to get in terms of philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| Do you feel that this ethics committee is something that should look at day-to-day issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7919)|
| 2:12:08| you know, this person was wrong, that person was wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| or more, you know, higher level commissioners, improprieties, mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7931)|
| 2:12:18| So I'm trying to get to what you think here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| I think you're going to have to do both if there's not already in place another method for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| to have their issue addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| And, of course, the most important thing is don't make any conclusions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| until you have all the facts that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| But I would say that having read your ethics policy, it covers everyone that works for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7960)|
| 2:12:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| Any other questions for Mr. Burleson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| Mr. Burleson, before you leave, and this will address the others that are left out here too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| how I'm assuming it will work on Monday is, Mr. Burleson, we've got three slots to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| and we'll go around the commission and we'll start and ask for nominations from the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| and the first person to get six votes fills this term, then we keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| And so you might not win a first-round vote or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| but just hang in there for all you applicants out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| And until somebody gets six votes, then that person is in, the next person to get six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| I'm assuming, Mr. Law Director, that's how we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| And the partial one too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| The next is Scott Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| Scott, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| And thank you for staying with us, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| That's worth something, I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8022)|
| 2:13:43| Glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| I'm Scott Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| I live at 1009 East Tacoma Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| I am a native of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| I have my wife, she's an attorney here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| and I work at Bush Brothers & Company off Wise Garber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| We have two young boys here, both of which will be entering the Knox County school system here in a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| As a native of Knox County, I went to West High School and then went to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| I have my undergraduate degree, law degree, and business degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| After that, I then moved away for several years working for Procter & Gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8049)|
| 2:14:15| I've lived and I should say worked in Fayetteville, Arkansas, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Toronto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| After working largely in the household detergent business while at P&G, I had a chance to come back to my hometown in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8061)|
| 2:14:30| Since then, I'd like to say I've been working for a talking dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| but ultimately trying to sell a few more Bush Bakes beans every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| My interest in the Knox County Ethics Committee largely is connected to my interest in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8077)|
| 2:14:43| and one of the big reasons we wanted to come back to Knoxville was we feel like Knoxville is a great place to raise our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8083)|
| 2:14:49| It had a huge impact on me growing up, and since being back, I see the town has become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| and it's just been amazing to watch the journey of where we were when I think back in the late 90s when I was in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8094)|
| 2:15:00| and where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| And I think a big part of that continued growth is being a place where our residents have a lot of confidence in the choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| that our government's making and how they're representing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| as well as in the choices that businesses and government are making together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8110)|
| 2:15:15| So that being said, that's where I think that having an integrity-driven both government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| and really both operating environment for both the residents and the government and the businesses is truly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8119)|
| 2:15:25| I really don't see the Ethics Committee as much of a watchdog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| as more so an organization that would collaborate with all branches of government and the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8129)|
| 2:15:34| to make sure that we have an open and transparent environment for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| And that's what I would really hope that the Ethics Committee would focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| but also understand there does come a time that issues would need to be investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| and looked into and ultimately consultated upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| So that being said, I'd be open to any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| Mr. Olmey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| Yeah, basically the same question I asked before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| You'd be available 8.30 in the morning for these meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| Yes, I do travel some for work, but as long as I know the meetings in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| I would plan to take paid time off work to attend the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| Also, one more while I was thinking, kind of like on the lines of what Commissioner McKenzie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| was the scope of Ethics Committee has kind of dwindled down over the course of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8176)|
| 2:16:26| Should it be expanded back to have more oversight, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8186)|
| 2:16:32| on other issues than just gifts given to elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| and basically because that's all it really looks at anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| I would have to tell you my knowledge of where the Ethics Committee has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| has largely been what I've read in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| Actually, I applied once before for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| and what I was interested in at the time and what I would remain interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| is that seeing what is the correct scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| I would really, if it were my call alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| I would like to understand what is the need for the Ethics Committee in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| and that's largely working with you guys to identify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| and then see our committee craft that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| Because, frankly, at least what I've been able to read as a resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| I don't know if there is a clear vision for how the Ethics Committee should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| or what role it should serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| So, to me, it maybe starts with objective, and then it goes to how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| But, again, that's from a largely what I would still say is rather uninformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| because it's only been through media coverage that I've been exposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| Any of your family members, Scott, do they work for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| Any questions from other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| And, Scott, and for you other people, if you'll be here on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| you may be given a chance to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| Next I have on the list is Joseph Foy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| David Gallette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| Nicholas Hodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| You all are going to win by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| David Howe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| Debbie Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| Anybody here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| Dr. Kilforth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| Jason Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| Jason, come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| We've got three people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| My name is Jason Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| I live at 6117 Glen May off Western Avenue here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| I'm currently the stormwater coordinator for the town of Farragut, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| And as the stormwater coordinator for my municipality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| I've had a lot of experience working with committees as the staff representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8329)|
| 2:18:54| I don't actually live in the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| so when I saw an opportunity to serve on a committee for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| I was really interested in extending that service as a resident to the community that I actually live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8341)|
| 2:19:08| And it's actually been something that I've been looking at for about a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| It's actually really challenging to get onto committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| They're really competitive here in the city-county area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| So that's really what incentivized my interest to put my name in the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| I'm not a resident inherently long-term of Knox County or the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8362)|
| 2:19:28| I grew up in middle Tennessee in Clarksville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| My dad was in the Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| I went to Austin Peace State University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| I graduated there with a degree in art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| Interesting journey to be told from there to where I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| But in 2006, I joined AmeriCorps NCCC, which is a national service program for 18- to 24-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8382)|
| 2:19:50| I had never really done quite as immersive as a volunteer experience as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| And during 2006, I spent the better part of the year doing disaster recovery related to Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi and Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8395)|
| 2:20:02| And it was that year that really shaped my—it transformed and really shaped my long-term perspectives on what I wanted to do with my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8402)|
| 2:20:10| Having an art degree unfortunately didn't inherently qualify me to be a disaster response professional or an environmental service professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8410)|
| 2:20:21| which I also did a good degree of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| And when I finished my term of service, I was kind of left with the spot where what am I going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8423)|
| 2:20:28| What am I going to do with my life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| And I ended up choosing the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| It was an area that I'm interested in and doing work in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| And I knew that I needed more experience and I needed more money for college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| So I did a second term of AmeriCorps with Florida State Parks in Jacksonville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| I served there doing a variety of natural resource conservation efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| And during that period, I pursued my master's degree in environmental policy and management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| which led to an internship with one of the water management districts in the state and then the position with the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8454)|
| 2:21:01| which I've been at ever since for five years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| And I'm very comfortable saying that me and my wife live here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| And this is the first place that I've ever lived that I've really defined as home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8468)|
| 2:21:14| And it's probably the length of time that I've been here and some of the unique characteristics of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| But growing up in the military, you move every three years or so, which makes it difficult to put down roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8479)|
| 2:21:25| And when I got into college and did AmeriCorps and these other things, I traveled around a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| so I got to see a lot of the characteristics of a lot of different cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| And then when we moved to Knoxville, we did so because my wife got into UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| It was just kind of a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| We're going to move to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8499)|
| 2:21:40| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| Good school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| But having lived here now in three different places, we love Knoxville and we intend to stay here for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8502)|
| 2:21:49| My fundamental interest is to give back public service to the community I live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8509)|
| 2:21:57| Thank you, Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| Commissioner Olmstead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| Just the same question that I gave to the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| I'm available for all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| And any of your family members work for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8532)|
| 2:22:13| More of a comment than a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| Having been on the first ethics committee that we had, I think that our colleagues are right on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| when I think one of the first things this committee needs to do is to define its scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| and the types of things that they're going to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| Because when you look at the history of the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| we've had instances where people have actually had to hire attorneys to go before this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| because of some of the things that were being looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| That, to me, probably is going a bit overboard when you have elected officials or employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| who are going to have to hire attorneys to appear before the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8564)|
| 2:22:48| So I think that I would challenge you, again, to say thank you for putting your name out for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| if you are selected, to perhaps look at the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| It probably needs to be rewritten in certain places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| but also have a clearly defined scope of what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| I know that while I was on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| there was one instance where we had an individual through the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| that was going to places and giving them a low score and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| oh, by the way, if you take this class, your score will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| Well, guess who taught the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| And guess who got the money for the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| Well, we didn't know anything about that until somebody reported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| When the individual was confronted, obvious ethics violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| the individual resigned from Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| I think that would be proper to look at if you have those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| because you obviously don't want that type of activity going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| But if it's something that delves into the attorney general or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| again, you have to determine as a committee how you want to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| And if you determine that you do want to move ahead, one of the issues I had was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| if we're going to start acting as a court of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| and if you're going to have to start taking testimony from people that could be used in a court of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| then the rules change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| And I think that you, at that point, you have to be fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| and you really need to have someone there who has judicial experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| who can hear both sides and make sure that both sides are treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| I could go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| I say that I applaud you for doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| but I would encourage you to really define the scope of the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8652)|
| 2:24:16| and how you want to move forward and the types of things that you feel you need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| Anything else for Jason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8665)|
| 2:24:26| Garrett Swartwood, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| The three of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| If you all will please come back on Monday at 2 o'clock when we start our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| And if you don't make it, there's always county commission offices up in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| They could run for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8683)|
| 2:24:51| You'll probably have to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| Well, that's pretty much first on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| It's some of the first items on the agenda, so you all will not have to wait this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| Did I hear anything else come before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Briggs can go to our former News Sentinel reporter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| currently via our reporter's blog, Screens from the Porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| and be brought up to date on the arrest problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| He's got the video on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Right, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| Talking about you, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| He's got a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| I just noticed it on his blog last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| You can get the replay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| Commissioners, I felt like we had a good meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| I know we didn't have that much on the agenda, but when we don't have that much on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| that's when we usually bring some things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| I thought we had some good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| I look forward to seeing you all next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8738)|
| 2:25:39| Everybody have a good week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| Mike, were you one of the ones arrested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131021?start=8741)|
