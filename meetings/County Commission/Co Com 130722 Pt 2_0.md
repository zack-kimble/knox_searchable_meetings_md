| 0:00:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=0)|
| 0:00:02| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2)|
| 0:00:03| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3)|
| 0:00:04| Yes, I just wanted to comment again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4)|
| 0:00:07| And I really agree and have the same concerns that Commissioner Anders has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=7)|
| 0:00:12| and also that Commissioner Hammond has about trying to get it right because I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=12)|
| 0:00:19| But it seems like the thing that we're concerned about the most deals with we want to be certain we choose someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=19)|
| 0:00:27| who we can bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| And the criminal background check is certainly, you know, part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| I'm not sure exactly what we have to do to do the credit checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=32)|
| 0:00:35| But we as individuals trying to do that, that's not to say that we might miss something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| and we might go ahead and think we've got the right person and then they can't be bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=40)|
| 0:00:45| And I think that's what a lot of the concern is about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| One thing that I want to throw out there for consideration is because we're really not going to know they're bonded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=49)|
| 0:00:57| until the bonding company gets the name of an individual and then reviews it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| One of the things that we could do is to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| and if we can get six votes on someone is to make the appointment even today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| with the contingent that we have to be able to get a bond at a reasonable price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| Now, we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Well, we can spend a month or two months doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| And then we can nominate someone still they may not be able to get bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| They may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| But the thing is, is this is the same thing we did with the judicial magistrates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| is that we nominated somebody and on further review by the judges, they said that person is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| And so we had to go back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| But we didn't know because of the process we had at that time whether that person was going to be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| until we put the name out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| And that's something we can do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| We may think that we do our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| But the bonding company, who has a real financial interest in it, may dig in places that I don't know how to dig,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=115)|
| 0:02:04| either looking for credit or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| I mean, I'm just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| I mean, it's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Would you like to make that as a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Well, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| I might end up voting against it myself if I hear, you know, a good argument against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| So I'll put that out as a substitute motion that we go ahead, vote today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| and with the contingent that if we can't get this person bonded at a reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| because that's what the concern is, is about the bonding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| That we, that there is a contingent on there that we would reject it once we get back from the bonding company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=155)|
| 0:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| So we've got a motion, a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| I seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Mr. Law Director, as we get into that discussion, does that seem reasonable as far as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Everything is at the pleasure of this body as to how you want to handle this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| I don't see any, you know, there's no legal position right now that's in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| I guess I'd like to argue that point because if you elect somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| you give somebody six votes, they are appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| and the only way to remove them from office is through ouster or any other means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| You can't set parameters on an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| We did it with the judicial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| If you'll let me, I'll let you have your time if you'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| The judicial magistrates are county employees that are appointments of the judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| and employees of the judges in the General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| They are not the county banker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| And I think once you six vote somebody, you have put somebody in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| And I think that I don't think you can take that away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| As a commission, you cannot take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| I just don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| I think that's a legal challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| The statute states that once a person is basically nominated and elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| they must take an oath and be bonded to actually hold the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| If they're not bonded, then they're not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| And I think they will be disqualified as a candidate and an elected official at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| Just like any other elected official we find is not eligible to be elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| then the election would be void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| I'll be glad to get you a better opinion on that, but I think that's where we would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| I think that's enters Knox County into some muddy waters that we don't need if we can defer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| and get away with that, get away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=280)|
| 0:05:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| We have Ms. Boyles, do you want to go first here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| I think, be that as it may, about, you know, bonding and holding office or appointments or whatever, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| if a commissioner asks to postpone something, as a general rule, out of professional courtesy, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=317)|
| 0:05:27| There are commissioners here who would like, obviously, to have this postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| I also think that, you know, Mike Brown had intended to miss today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| He had planned it before all this erupted with the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| And I think that this is an important enough vote that all of us need to be here for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| And I think that out of professional courtesy, if there are some who would like to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| as a general rule, we do that as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| And also out of respect for our colleague who's not here and who ought to be, we need to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=357)|
| 0:06:07| We do have, well, I've got lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| We have a couple of people that have signed up to speak on the issue of trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| I feel like we ought to give them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Would you like to have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Is that okay if we do that right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| So if you had, I think, Mr. Andrew, Ms. Absher, would you like to speak at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| If you would, come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| And give your name, Ms. Absher, and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| You'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| My name is Sally Absher, 5517 River Point Cove, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Thank you for the time to speak on this issue today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| And I've enjoyed the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| I, too, would like to see this deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| I have discussed my concerns via e-mail and in person with Ed Schaus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| but I feel so strongly about this issue that I wanted to make my comments publicly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| I am very concerned about the message that this sends to the voters of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| that we have a sitting Knox County commissioner applying for this trustee appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| In 2008, the people of Knox County wrote several Knox County charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| They brought those charter amendments to county commission, which rejected them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| Then the people collected signatures during a very hot summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| and forced those charter amendments on the ballot, and they were voted into law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| One of those charter amendments was on conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| It said, as you as commissioners cannot nominate a relative to fill a county office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| in the law you are related to yourself, which would imply that you cannot nominate yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| or put your application in for another county position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| Do we need a new charter amendment to define this more clearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| I'm asking you today to not allow the nomination of a sitting county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| to fill the trustee appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| When we vote for a commissioner, we expect them to serve their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| That is implied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| There's nothing in the oath of office that gives any wiggle room on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| I'm asking you to do the ethical thing and respect the will of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| No more loopholes or technicalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Just do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| We voted for a person to serve the role of commissioner, and that's what we expect him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| I am asking you today to select a caretaker for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| The last thing Knox County needs is for a sitting county commissioner to be appointed to the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| and have a lawsuit and all the trauma that would bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| We've discussed the bonding issues, and that may need to be resolved outside of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| But the voters spoke clearly in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| And I think that what you do today will show us if you respect the will of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| The easiest way to address this is to postpone and let further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| and further evaluation of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you so much for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Thank you, Ms. Thatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| I would like to ask first, have you folks decided when you are going to decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| I sense you have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| We still have some discussion here about time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Certainly two weeks was offered, a month has been offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| If it goes to that motion and this sub-motion fails, then we'll discuss that and decide on that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=589)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| I'd like to defer my comments until you decide when you are going to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| Thank you, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| I hope you get to decide when we decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=607)|
| 0:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| If we were to vote today and did not come to a six number for a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| and in each term somebody rotates off and then we go back and we postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| can that person be re-nominated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| It depends how you postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| If you defer the election because you've run out of steam, so we'd like to defer the continuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| and just continue this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Then they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Well, no, they're not out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| You'll continue the election at another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| If you want to, it's all how you move the motion when you terminate, Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| If you make the motion that we're at an impasse and we would like to start the process all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| and anybody would be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| I mean, it's all on how you handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| I guess I'm having just a little bit of heartburn over selecting someone with the contingency that if they can't get bonded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| then they can't serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| If I'm sitting out there and I'm not sitting here and that happens and we select someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| and they can't serve because they can't get bonded or there's some credit problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| as a citizen I'm going to say, well, why didn't you vet it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| Why didn't you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Why did you feel you had to do it today if you knew that this was a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| So I'm trying to put myself, because I am a citizen too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| and I'm trying to look at it from both angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| So I guess I'm having a little bit of an issue with a contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| I mean, I'd like to know that if we vote today that this person is going to be appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| they're going to be bonded, they're going to serve so that we don't have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| and possibly come back and have to do this all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| And so I would like, again, to get it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| And if it means that we take a few extra days, the sheriff has said he'll do it for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| And then the finance director says he can come up with a credit check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| and I don't think anybody would mind doing a credit check because that's one of the issues we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| So, I mean, if we can take a few extra days and get that done and present it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| I don't see the downside to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| I mean, personally, because, you know, I can say I can vote today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| but I also want to make sure that we are not setting ourselves up to have another issue come two weeks from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=752)|
| 0:12:41| or a few days from now because if we select someone today, they'll be sworn in today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| and then we go through the bonding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| And if we come in a few days and the bonding people and they can't get bonded and they can't serve, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| then the issue is going to be, well, why didn't you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| Why didn't you check them out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| And so I guess that's where I'm at is I just kind of like the opportunity to check them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I do not disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| I just want to ask, are we going to then reopen 818 because it's got today's date in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=787)|
| 0:13:15| I guess that would be a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| We've approved the procedures for how to select the trustee today using a resolution format and it's 818.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=801)|
| 0:13:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| It's already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| We would have to reopen that and put all of the discussion that we're having right now into that 818, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| Yes, if you defer it two-thirds, you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| You know, I'm pretty neutral on whether we delay our vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| I'm kind of like Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| But I guess my question is, I mean, statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| We kind of do this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| I mean, like we talked about with the magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| We appoint people and then we issue the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| I mean, we don't proactively go out and, you know, vet a lot of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=851)|
| 0:14:19| I know this is a trustee position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| However, you know, what happens if one gets elected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| Don't have a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| There's a process and they put their name out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| I mean, to be honest, and it's embarrassing and all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| I don't know if that's where people are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| But, you know, once a person says, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I wish to seek the office or the appointment of trustee, they kind of put themselves out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| And that should be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| If they don't, you know, cut it as far as being able to be bonded, then we just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| I just don't see that as being an insurmountable issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| If there's other reasons, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| But to hold the process up, because something that we do all the time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| you could go to Mr. Wren, who spoke to us earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| You know, that's kind of the way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| They tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| They started a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| The test came back, according to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| I'm just recanting what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| The test came back with probably something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| And they said, thank you, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| And, yeah, he had started the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| It's painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| But that's kind of the way this world works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| So, again, I'm okay either way, but, you know, I would like to get us back up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=932)|
| 0:15:45| And right now, I know, I'm sure Ms. Phillips is capable and able, but she's not the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=945)|
| 0:15:54| She's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| I think we need to get a trustee as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| And we talk about a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| What would this one-month delay do to a credit rating agency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| Okay, folks in Knox County are putting it off another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| Is that a message?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Is it not a message?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Well, I don't think we can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| I don't think we can say either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| I don't think we knew that this person wasn't going to get bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| You know, so, again, for us to make a drastic decision solely based on whether a person gets bonded or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=982)|
| 0:16:30| I just don't think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| If we want to do it for whatever reason, this body can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| But I don't think that needs to be the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| Okay, anything else there, Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Mr. Caldwell, I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| We've gotten down to the issue of qualification, disqualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| And talk about being put on the spot, on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| I guess this is what we're doing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| You and I have talked about bonded, the issue of bonding some of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| The last time we talked, you said or you indicated to me that you thought there was that's a non-issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:22| that whoever we select, you felt comfortable with us being able to bond them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| And so, if we're at my point in this argument is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| and I don't disagree with more time necessarily being a part of something that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| But every single person on this platform has vetted the people or the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| or persons that they're most likely to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| And that's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| And I think we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| I don't think we would come to the meeting if we hadn't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| So, just to the issue of disqualifying, all right, given all of what's taking place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:12| and maybe also to the issue of delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| What does this, what do these things do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| Do we have any way to anticipate what these types of things would do in terms of a bonding agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:29| and how they react to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| First, the disqualification of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| I mean, realistically, we might have five or six or seven people that theoretically could be selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:50| I mean, when I look at the list, that's what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| And I don't see disqualification being an issue with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| So, our broker says, one of the brokers that we're dealing with says that selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| that they can reasonably assure us that if you select a respectable person, that we can be bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| You can take that and spin it any way you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| Sure, my gut would tell me that, as I told you, select who you feel is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:41| And I don't think anybody should be disqualified because you have this concern over a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| But, you know, it's not up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| It's going to be up to our broker and the underwriter to say this person is bondable or not, because we know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| When you select the next trustee, if they cannot be bonded, then we're back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:11| And keep in mind, and I've said this for a week now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| we were denied our bond not because of Kristen Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| We were denied our bond because of the history of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| Now, I can make assumptions on why they denied us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| And I think the more information we can give them and provide them, we can make our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| I would say not to disqualify anyone and just to select who you think is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| And you think we can bond them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| You think they will be bonded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Yeah, my head will be on the chopping block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| But, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| Yeah, you know, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| Okay, what if we delay this until August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| What effect does that have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| What is that effect that you can see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Can you anticipate any effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Sure, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Here's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| A delay does, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Does it make the comptroller's office nervous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| Yeah, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| But they're probably already nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| The external auditor, will they be nervous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| They're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| It's just a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| But to me, the key is to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| And if it takes two weeks to get it right, whatever you all think is best is what you should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| I'm not the expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| I can guarantee you that the finance department will work with the trustee's office in any way possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| to make sure things get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| I'll tell you, Mark Jones busted his rear end last week working on that bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| And nobody talks about that, but it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| And he worked with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| And he worked with me and, of course, with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| And nobody sees that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| But he knows what it's going to take to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| And so when he says, choose a respectable person, and that's what he's being told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| that's all we can do is inform you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| I don't think anybody should be disqualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| I'll get off my soapbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Thank you, Mr. Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| When I turned my light on, I was going to ask a question to make the director of finance say in plain English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:48| probably in answer to my question, which is also Commissioner McKenzie's question, what does this do for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:59| It's not the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| It's the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| It's the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| It's the desk that's having trouble getting bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| It's not the person that's sitting there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| And I believe that's what the bonding agent is telling me when I gather the information about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| It's not placing the director of finance on the hot seat because the hot seats are all up here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| with the exception of a few here on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| The hot seats are with the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| And we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| We're the only ones that are going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| We're the ones that have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| So if it's not the people that are standing before us today that are causing the bonding issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| it's Knox County that's causing the bonding issue because of our past history in that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| not the person that's going to go fill it here tomorrow morning because if you've heard what I've had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1431)|
| 0:24:02| I think it ought to be someone that can leave here this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| and find that desk tomorrow morning and get on with the business of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| Then the other half of what I think I just collected is the fact that it does make some people uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| if we start moving this down the road for another four weeks or even another two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| Because even when we get to the end of two weeks or four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| we still don't know if the person we really accepted or appointed is one that can be bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| I mean, we may have a feel for that because we've done background checks or credit checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| but we still don't know any more about that person than we really might know today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| I'm 55-45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Let's move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| I want to remind us of one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| We're talking about the Hartford Insurance Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| That's one insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Ladies and gentlemen, there are thousands of insurance companies out there, thousands of insurance companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| And they'll fight for our business, try to get our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| And I have every confidence in Chris Caldwell, Mark Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| Folks, here's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Here's what our underwriting process is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| And then the underwriters will take it and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| But there's thousands of companies besides just the Hartford that can look at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| We have before us a substitute motion to proceed with our selection process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| as we have reviewed in resolution with the additional caveat that it be contingent upon the ability to bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:53| the person selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Is that understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| That's our substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Let's roll call and start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1566)|

| 0:27:10| So we will proceed with our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| We have made a sort of made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| We won't take a break on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| We're not going to break on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Go ahead, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Name and address and get a little closer there, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Today, Knox County stands at the fork of a road, and you, our county commissioners, have your hands on the tiller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| Your choices are simple and distinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| One, you can steer Knox County back to the days of political cronyism via the good old boy system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| where you can appoint an interim trustee who has had no association whatsoever with the past trustees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| administrations that have embarrassed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| That appointment should be as apolitical as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| Knox County needs such apolitical stewardship of this office during the next 14 months as county government continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:29| to rebuild credibility and to regain trust of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| Recognize Hartford's query for what it was, a salient and timely warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| Business as usual under the gob system will be recognized for what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| perpetuation of the self-centered consolidation and concentration of power among the city, county building circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:58| Folks, recognize the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Now is the opportunity for statesmen of Knox County to distinguish themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| Statesmen who are sufficiently confident in their qualifications and abilities to make their case to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| electorate still have time to withdraw from this appointment-feeding frenzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:23| Such statesmen will be positioned to present their cases to voters on an even playing field in an equitable election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:33| That is what will bring out the best of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Thank you, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:51| Okay, now we're at the point in the process where we open the floor for nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| From the floor, do we have any nominee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| I mean open the floor for recommendations towards nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| I've kept quiet this last 45 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| I've had an opinion or two, but I didn't think it proper that I start editorializing my point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| I did support the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| I think I don't see a harm in credit checks and background checks and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| But the body has decided to move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| You know, this thing, we've been going through this for 21 days now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| I think it hit three weeks ago today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| And I had a lot of people just contact me and say, I think you'd be good for that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| People that have supported me in the past and people that haven't necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| And I thought about it and, you know, thought, well, what's the harm in putting my name in the hat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| I enjoy numbers and enjoy that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| And I've been a trustee, not in a public environment in my past, but for a bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| And so I work with big numbers and have a history in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| But nevertheless, I keep hearing the, and I respect what Ms. Absher and Mr. Anderson and others have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| I did hear some, a few people on talk radio here and there saying things similar to what they have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| And I certainly respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| I know we worked very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Bud and I fought it out actually three years ago, and we're very good friends now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| We were then, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| But to win a seat in one of the newly created at large seats running in 93 precincts is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:32| Let me state that emphatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| But getting back to the subject, I keep hearing insider, insider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| I guess I'm perceived as an insider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| There are two former commissioners applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| They're insiders, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| There are two other people who worked for the trustee's office in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| I assume they're insiders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| I don't know if that's the eye of the beholder, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| So the more I think about it, the vast majority of people I have asked about this role in the courthouse, at my church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:09| grocery store, at the bank, walking up and down Gay Street say, we think you'd be great for that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| We hope you get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| I've heard it today a dozen times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Hope you get that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| I text all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| But looking at what this county went through six, seven years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| and I'm thinking about Black Wednesday, of course, but now we know stuff going on prior to that, ghost employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:36| fake title searches, fake surveys, who knows what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| and the unfortunate things in the Duncan office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Looking at what we went through, I have a hard time keeping myself in this race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| Although I think I'm qualified, I won't say I'm better than these other guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| I would say I'm as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| I'm honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| You can do all the credit checks and background checks you want to on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| I think it will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| But having said those things, I think it's just probably more equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| and probably more fair to the citizens of Knox County who put me in this seat, which I love, to take my name out of the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1989)|
| 0:33:19| It's pretty difficult because I have a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| But having said that, if I take my name out, Mr. Lord Director, I can sit here and vote, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2002)|
| 0:33:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| You're a commissioner with all the eligible credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| We had a conversation Saturday at the event at Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| And he told me I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| He interpreted the statute, the state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| and also the document we just passed an hour or so ago about the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| I would actually get up and walk out in the audience and not be party to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| So I will just formally say, don't nominate me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| I will take my name out of contention for this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Regrettably, I think I would do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| I would like to have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| And to further that, the primary is only eight months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| So maybe let's put it like it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| And all of us insiders just look towards next April's primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| and we can let the voters of Knotts County settle the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| And I would assure you I'm looking at it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| So I will be voting for someone who we're calling a placekeeper that I feel is qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:44| I would have liked to have had some documentation on a couple of the placekeepers I intend to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| but I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| So I do have some good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I've gone through the 8,800 pages of resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| I have some good ideas who I will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| But I will be, I'll state I will be supporting someone who I think is totally qualified, but will, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| will not have the continuity to move this office forward after a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| But, nevertheless, it's a great opportunity for someone to come in and do a lot of hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| and make a lot of hard decisions and hopefully put that office where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| So I'll shut up my editorializing and try to figure out exactly who I plan to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Thank you, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| I just wanted to make a statement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| I think that that really speaks a lot to the character of Ed Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| And I know that took a lot of courage and soul searching to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| And I think it also says a lot, we have a lot of other good candidates on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| but that really says a lot about you and your character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| And, you know, it means a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| The statement that I really wanted to make dealt with the employees of the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| because we're hearing a lot like we need to send someone in to clean up the corruption there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| or there's a problem in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| And I think we really ought to make clear that the problem has not been the employees of the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| but the problem has been the office holders that were elected there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| There's many loyal, dedicated employees who should not be condemned as corrupt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| because the office holders that were placed by the citizens as their bosses had problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| There's been two TBI investigations into that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| One on an office holder that had been there, I believe, since 1994,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| and then the other most recent that we're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| And I think after a thorough investigation by the TBI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| if there were other people in that office who were involved in something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| it would have been found out after two investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| I don't think we should condemn the people or tarnish their reputations that have worked there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| but I think they should actually be commended that in spite of everything that's gone on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| they've stayed there, they've been loyal, they've worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| and they've served the taxpayers in spite of the people that have been elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| And I just wanted to make that statement because I know many of the people that work there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| have been just as upset over what's happened in their office as much as many of the voters have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:40| And in spite of all of that, they've done their jobs, the office is still working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| and it will continue to work because of those loyal and dedicated employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| You know, I wasn't going to necessarily comment on this, but it's very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| So I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| And that's, well, one, I'd like to say I'll agree with what Commissioner Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| and what Commissioner Shouse said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| I'm sure you really, really wanted that job or you wouldn't put your name into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| So I do applaud you for making your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:25| But what I want to talk about is this whole notion of good old boy network cronyism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| I'm sick of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Hadn't happened in my five years plus here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| Okay, quit comparing this commission to commissions of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| We have done an excellent job of keeping things transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| So folks coming up here acting like we're all relatives so we can't vote against each other, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| It really is, it's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| And so quit trying to force us to make decisions over something that happened a decade ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2334)|
| 0:39:01| That's just, with my votes and my process, that's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| You know, the whole thing of a placeholder, to me, speaks of, well, we don't trust commission to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| so we just put someone in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Quit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| That's not the commission and the commissioners that you voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| We've not conspired on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| You all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| You all realize, and I'm speaking to the public generally, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| And so I do think we have restored the public's trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| We will continue to build on that, but we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| So, but it's kind of like you still have to keep looking over your shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| And that's okay to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| But not to a point that we're not effectively doing what we were elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| We were elected to make some tough, tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| This decision to not delay this was extremely tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| But I feel it was for the right reasons, not for anyone in my ear or anything like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| but me as a sitting commissioner representing the people of the first district, I think it's time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| So that's why I made the decision to do it, not because of any underhanded deal going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| And, you know, so for that to continually be put forward to a point that people wanted to affect our votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| and our processes, hopefully that won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| It won't happen with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| And hopefully it won't happen with us as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| So, you know, I guess my last thing, this whole notion of an incumbent having some kind of advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:39| I really think those days are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| We look at our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| I mean, you know, a law director ran against an appointed incumbent and lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| The incumbent lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| So, you know, you look at the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| I think our voters are more informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| They're voting on the issues, partisan or not, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| They're voting on the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| They're voting on what they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| They're not just going down, clicking incumbent, incumbent, incumbent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| That just doesn't happen anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| And that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| But let's celebrate that and not keep reliving, you know, the distant past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| So that's just I wanted to say that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| And I'm confident that this nomination process will be open and genuine one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| I know there's been no backroom deals there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| So that's just really frustrating to continually be accused of that when it's just flat out not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie, for expressing in several words more eloquently than I might about the status of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:54| commission right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Also, Dr. Briggs, the office of the trustee has been stained by ghost employees or $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:10| I really appreciate your comments to the office continues to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| As in all offices, there's always room for incremental improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| And I think the employees have driven that over the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| But really the reason I had my light on was to commend Commissioner Shoust on the action that he's taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:41| He ran an excellent, well, no, I shouldn't say that, countywide race because he won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:51| That's tongue in cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I want to say, though, that I feel like that Commissioner Shoust has an excellent background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2573)|
| 0:43:03| His reputation here on commission has been to try to get the big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| which is what the at-large commissioner should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| And I want to publicly thank him for taking the position that he has, collecting all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:18| and dealing with it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| As it goes back to anything can happen until nominations cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| And I appreciate what you've done, Commissioner Shoust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| I, too, want to commend Commissioner Shoust for the position he's taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| It is rare that you see someone put the public interest above their own personal interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| He has done that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| He has put the public's interest above his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| And I applaud that and thank him for it and admire him for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| And I do hope that he will put his name in nomination for trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| If he doesn't, I hope he'll come back on this body because I think the county needs him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| or someone like him who has the financial background that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| So, Ed, best of luck to you as you continue and think about what you want to do for your political future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| I'm ready to make a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| I don't know what the procedure is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| And I would like to have an opportunity to explain why I am making a nomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| when that time comes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| We've got some people that have moist eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| And so not because they're crying, but because they've got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| And so we're going to take five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| and then we're back into this same portion of the process, five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:55| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Please have a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| We're in the portion of our procedure where we're still taking recommendations from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| Are there any further recommendations from the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Anybody in the audience like to speak or recommend from the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:18| Seeing there is none, we'll move on to the next part of the process where we accept nominations from the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Now, we'll begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| Do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| We're going to start in the first district with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| I'd like to nominate Frank D. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| He was the gentleman that actually sent us an application, sent it to us individually, but not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| I don't think he sent it to commission, but it was in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| I am extremely confident that Mr. Robinson has the pedigree to pass whatever background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:06| investigation, financial, criminal that can be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| And also, I've seen his body of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| Extremely hardworking individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| So I'd like to enter Frank Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Ms. Broils?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I would like to nominate Mike Manning for trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| I was very impressed with Hender's interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| I've looked at his resume and his work, and I think he's absolutely excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:36| Can we make comments at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| My feeling, and I also tremendously respect Ed Schaus and would have very much liked to see Ed be trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:51| but I felt like I would have been unable to vote for Ed in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| I feel like there are several good people out of the trustee's office who would make excellent trustees as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:07| but I feel like this issue of regaining the public's trust in the trustee's office is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:18| And I think anyone who has worked in the trustee's office under Duncan III or under Mike Lowe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:27| this is not to say they had anything to do with anything that happened there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| because I don't believe that they did, far from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| But in the public's mind, I think that creates a barrier to trust if we bring in someone who served in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:45| under either of those two trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| And so I'm unable to support those candidates as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| I think that a clean break and a new face is what the public will be most receptive to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2872)|
| 0:48:03| And fortunately, there are a lot of people who turned in great resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| There are a number of people who I think can do this job and do it in a very excellent manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| I know from my work on the Audit Committee that we mentioned that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| tax notices go out in October and the peering company, the external auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| is going to come in next month and work with the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| And those things, frankly, are handled by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| The trustee is not involved in day-to-day operations with the external auditor or in sending out tax notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:40| So I think we need someone with incredibly good financial background and excellent management skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:50| whose reputation is above approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| And so that's why I'm supporting Mike Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Mr. Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| I'm going to --I'd like to nominate a person that I think we can put into the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| and have no question about his ethics, about his understanding of government, and can run the office with complete trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:22| The way that you gain trust is not through being an outsider, but by being honest and running the office right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:32| This is not the first time that I've recognized this person for who I know he is, which is a very honest person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:40| I nominated him twice to be chairman of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| and I voted for him to be the chairman of our Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| And I'd like to put the name of Craig Lutho forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Mr. Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I'm sorry, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| Well, I was going to make the nomination of Mike Manning, and I, too, will make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| I don't know of any other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| You know, the letter from the insurance company, some of the arguments that were just made, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| we're talking about the bonding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| But the letter of the insurance company to the county said the actions of past employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| And I don't know anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| I don't know Fred Sisk, Mr. Curtis, Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| They're all high in character, and they're all great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| But I don't, I think that we need to be very careful in appointing somebody that's potentially going to testify in a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| or in a criminal proceeding next year as former employees of the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| And so that's, we're going, I'm going caretaker, and I'm going with Mike Manning on my votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| But he's already been nominated, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| I ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| My candidate has also been nominated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| I'm going to be going the caretaker route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I've been very vocal about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| I feel like that we need someone that's going to be laser focused on that office for the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| until August 31st of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Being involved in the political spectrum, knowing what it takes to raise money, to campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| to do all of the things that you need to do to be elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| that would take away from my point of view what needs to happen right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| And I agree with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| The people that go to work every day, they've been tainted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| Knox County government has been tainted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| And I think that people are looking to us to do something to get that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| And so I hope that, and I know that we will by making our choice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| I will be voting for the caretaker for that reason, not that these other people are not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| I look forward to a spirited campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| They can pick up their nominations and paperwork in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| The primaries are just eight months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| And so that gives people an opportunity to really go out and to take their case to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| I have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| The body, I'll take my turn in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| And I would like to nominate Bill Curtis also for the similar reasons that have already been expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:38| about the caretaker role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| And in my process of inquiry about Mr. Curtis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| I find him to be beyond repute and the type of person that we need for this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| He will leave this office, according to people inside county government and outside county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| He is an outstanding financial manager, and he will leave this office in excellent shape for whoever is to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:08| So it's my honor to nominate William Curtis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| Does the pass wish, any pass wish to nominate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3194)|
| 0:53:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Do I hear a motion that nomination cease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Mr. Chairman, could we go over the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| You may, we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| I would just like to have a refresher on how we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I'm stepping through the script right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| So if I misstep, I've got a guy poking me right next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| So, of course, the process will be essentially we'll vote on those nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3232)|
| 0:54:00| The low vote getter or the low total or totals will be bumped off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:08| and then we'll resume voting in the next round with the remaining nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| That's essentially it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| And the magic number is six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| And the magic number is six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3258)|

| 0:54:24| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Are all the nominees willing to accept the nomination and, if elected, willing to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3281)|

| 0:54:53| I'm just looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| He was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| I didn't see Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| He was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| I don't see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Frank has to be present or he has to have a written acceptance of the nomination and his willingness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| Why don't we just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3313)|

| 0:59:55| As you come forward, would you like to say something to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3595)|
| 1:00:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| I know you had to put a lot of thought into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| I've sat in your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| I know how difficult that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| I have a lot of respect for Ed, a lot of respect for all the other people that put their names forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| It's not every day that people have a chance to put their name forward for a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| and I respect for them for stepping forward and wanting to serve in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| I commend them for doing that, and I hope that they continue to be visible in the eyes of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:44| and continue to work towards a better Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| First, I want to thank my wife and my youngest son, Craig, who's here, and my dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3650)|
| 1:01:02| And I want to let you know, you won't be disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:11| We're going to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| What time is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| They leave at 4.30, so we'll start first thing in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| And we're going to build the trust back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I know someone said, I said that to someone, and someone said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| you're borrowing Coach Jones' philosophy to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| We're going to build the trust back one day at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| You can't expect to have the trust back overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| But I can assure you that we're going to do things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| We're going to do things transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| We're going to do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| And I'm going to work to do the best job I can as being the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| And I want to thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:09| Okay, we're going to recess now while Chancellor Weaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| Come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Come right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Thank you, Chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:32| Get his son up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:41| Where's Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3761)|
| 1:03:20| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:51| I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:20| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3892)|

| 1:05:48| Great Schools Partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, local match funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Any discussion, Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| I guess the only discussion is why is this before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| I know we customarily, if there's a nay vote, that we'll pull it off consent, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| with the way we've agreed to deal with the schools, if we had questions, we would bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| those up during the work session and I'll vet those, but those things automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| So, I guess my question is why this one is appearing before us at the regularly scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Okay, would anybody like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| Well, it wasn't on consent, it couldn't be pulled from consent because it wasn't on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:44| so if there is a negative vote, one no vote, then it is not allowed to go to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| So, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| I guess my question is, is education consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| That's what it's titled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Okay, so education is consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| So that's the agreed order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| And so I do appreciate and it should be an expectation that we can ask these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4023)|
| 1:07:13| but all that should happen at the work session, but the actual vote is a consent vote, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| is, again, when we set this work session slash commission meeting up, that's why we did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| so that we could vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| But we have education consent and then we build a consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| And so, to me, these educational issues shouldn't be vetted at this meeting, but the one the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4053)|
| 1:07:42| I guess I'll ask the law director if that is, in fact, the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:51| The answer is yes and no, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| Under the agreement, the agreement states that something may not be pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| That's the agreement that county commission made in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| Under the rules, the workshop establishes consent, whether it's a school, whether it's purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| whether it's anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| A consent calendar is established by rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| Also, under the statute, this is an appropriated item because you must vote on receiving a grant with a match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4100)|
| 1:08:29| which makes it a special event, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| So just kind of by default, because there was a negative vote under the rules, it wasn't put on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:41| And it just is where it is, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| Commission makes the rules, and that's where we find ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| I couldn't advise you otherwise because I'm just giving you what your rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| So I guess the question, and I'll look to Chairman, former Chairman Hammond, to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| When we first set up this process, when we went from intergovernmental and finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| and I know you weren't in that seat at the time, but we may want to do a review over the minutes on our votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| I'm pretty sure that that's what we decided upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| I don't know whether formal vote or not, but we decided upon the fact that we would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| the superintendent and his staff questions at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| and then we would not pull things off consent at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| Commissioner Hammond, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| That was the agreement that we had when we met at our retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| and we talked about this whole notion, and we agreed that any questions we had would come at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| but after that, everything would just be passed on education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| Now, whether that was formalized in writing, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| but that was the agreement that we had at our retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| and that's how we had been progressing with that understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| And my reasons for going on and on with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| oh, yeah, sure, the superintendent can answer these one or two questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| but, you know, today he's been here, you know, probably, you know, two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| As things go on, I mean, you know, we're paying him a pretty good sum per hour, you know, to do his job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| and I would rather him be here for a set amount of time at a prescribed hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| and not necessarily have to spend as much time here at this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| to probably answer questions he's already answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| So that's my concern going forward, that we're just holding, and not just him and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| I mean, this isn't a cheap two and a half hours for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Page seven, resolution 205,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| approving a contract in the amount of $1,200,000 with the Parthenon Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| to provide professional services in support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| to access resource alignment and effective implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| of instructional reforms funded in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| So is Dr. McIntyre still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| Is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| Dr. McIntyre, I'll just, because you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| I'm going to ask you a question just so your visit was not completely in vain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:40| And I had before, and thank you for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| and thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| And I truly believe that whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| we'll come to some agreement about this consent menu, but agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| But it's not, it's certainly not my intent to harass you or anybody else on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| I mean, it's just another place to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| And I had one question last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| The only thing I had about Parthenon was relative to teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| And you had responded that there was no credible teacher morale survey that really existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| that you thought would be of benefit to the system or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| Could you respond to that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| You know, my only, I think my response was something to the effect of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| I'm not aware of any quantifiable indicator or quantifiable instrument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| to measure teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| I think people talk a lot about teacher morale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| but I'm not aware of a specific instrument that is research-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| that is purported to accurately measure teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| And that was my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| I think we do a lot to try to get a sense of where our teachers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| in terms of things like surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| And I think I mentioned last time the TEL survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| which is a survey that the state of Tennessee conducts biannually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| to get a pulse of where our teachers are and what their thoughts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| We're about to kick off a probably six- to eight-month process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| of developing our next five-year strategic plan for the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| And that will entail a lot of conversations and dialogue with teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| that will help us really understand where they are and what their perspectives are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| I periodically hold what I call teacher talk meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| which are small gatherings of teachers in different regions around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| to talk with teachers, invite them to provide their feedback and their input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| let us know how they're doing and what their thoughts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| on some of the changes that are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| and some of the improvements and initiatives that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| And then we also do a series of public forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| and invite teachers to come and provide input in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| That's not to say there isn't a lot of ways that we can solicit input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| and hear the perspective of teachers and value their perspective of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| We try very much to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| I'm just not aware of a specific instrument that really purports to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| in a research-based way, measure teacher morale as a quantifiable indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| But if we could find something like that in the process of using Parthenon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| you wouldn't be against possibly looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| or seeing if it's applicable to our situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| We'd certainly give that consideration, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| That's all I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4476)|

| 1:17:55| She just read the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| I wanted to read, like we do with the auto resolutions, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4677)|

| 1:18:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4721)|

| 1:18:53| Okay, thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| And discussion regarding the Joint Education Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Mr. McKenzie, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| I'll start off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| My fellow Commissioners Burroughs, Wright, and Hammond, if they'd like to chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| But this past meeting was kind of more of the setup in terms of what our processes are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:22| And we had his assistant, I forgot her name, Dr. something or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| She facilitated the meeting, did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| But it was, again, more on how we're going to bring things forward, how we're going to present things to either body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:44| I think what we ended up deciding is that, you know, our meeting is kind of conducive for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| We meet the first Thursday in each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| With the exception of this one, we're going to meet on the 8th this time because of a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| So we're going to meet on August the 8th at 430 in the Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| But generally speaking, we will present the results of the meeting at this and allow for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:14| There will be an executive summary that will go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| And if you have comments on that, please just send them to our facilitator and not to the whole body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:28| What we don't want to get in is a vetting process on the e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| that that would be potentially deemed non-sunshine process deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| So that's, I don't know of anything other substantial that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| Building on that last sentence you had there about sunshine, there was a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| and I have given it to the law director to respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| in that it was thought that this small joint committee of the Board of Education and Commission, four and four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4862)|
| 1:21:15| that paths would be built or friendships or ways of communicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:24| And I believe the words that were used was be able to talk to that commissioner at any point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| about what might be going on between commission and the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:38| A couple of Board of Education people spoke to that particular circumstance of being able to build a dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:48| of Board of Education members and commission members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| As that was being discussed, I believe I brought it to the table saying that might be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4915)|
| 1:22:03| You can talk to any other commissioner except me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| And at the same time, I don't know whether I said it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| but the implication being is that I could talk to my Board of Education member, Mike McMillan, at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4932)|
| 1:22:23| because that's the way it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| But this joint committee being established by commission and the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:34| that committee that four of us are members of, and they have four members of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4954)|
| 1:22:42| can only speak at sunshined or publicly noticed meetings was my concern at the small committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:57| I sort of turned and looked at the law office person representing the law director that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| I sort of looked over my shoulder, and he says, I think I've got this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| He said, I didn't say that, but it sounds like a novel idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:17| I'm here this evening seeking further guidance about I know that the four members of commission that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:26| can talk to each other there, but we can't talk outside that noticed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| And I would assume I used to could go to a school board meeting and talk to Board of Education members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:42| but I've got four that I can't talk to right now on an unsunshined meeting because of us being joint committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:55| So I throw that out there for the law director to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| Well, Commissioner Wright got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| Anytime you have a committee whereby it is sunshined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| those members on that committee are constrained to the sunshine anytime they communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:25| When you are an advisory body to a deliberative body, which in this case you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| then you must be sunshine for all of your communications to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| I knew this would probably give everybody heartburn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| so the open records people have been contacted on this behalf, too, and they affirm that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:47| So we are where we are with the Open Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| You all can speak to anybody outside that committee other than commissioner to commissioner and school board to school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| but you cannot communicate outside the sunshine anything related to each other's discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5099)|
| 1:25:06| or what may become a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| You know how the rule goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| And so that's really where you are because it is a committee that is advisory to deliberative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| And that's the rule I got and that's kind of what we, even the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| when we analyzed it the first time we said, whew, and then we got the opinion to it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:28| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| I think that at that particular meeting I may have referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| or we could have referenced being members of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| We could not speak to other members of the Charter Review Committee or specifically to me or to Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:52| We cannot speak to the two citizen members of the audit committee without those meetings being sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| So I thought I'd appreciate you saying I may have had it semi-right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| My mama made me right by definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Oh, yeah, that was a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| And I'm still planning to check with CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| I think Mike was going to check with an attorney in Nashville as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| because we wonder if the difference being that this is not a voting body that it might make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| because otherwise, and this is one of the comments that one of the school board members make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| why are we there if we can't talk to each other outside of meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| It kind of defeats the whole purpose for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| I mean, that's what I took away from it, from that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| You know, and I guess I do mean to put a pretty fine point on this, and that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| this committee, we've developed a few things that we're going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| and we're going to potentially expand that list and what I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| but it will be expanded in a defined fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| I mean, we're not going to just, you know, talk about what the next school is being built and this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| We're going to talk about things that, you know, where we may not see eye to eye on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:40| So there will be a defined number of things that we'll talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| So my question is what the school board members want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| and what I want is to build a relationship on things, education in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| So I think what I heard you say, if we're not talking about things that are before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| or that will come before us, we can talk about affairs, you know, because I look at it like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| My first district person is on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| So if there's an issue with a teacher, administrator, building, I'm probably going to, you know, reach out to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:16| If I get a call saying, you know, there's a roof leak at Sarah Moore Green, I'm going to call Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| And that's not an issue that's going to come before this education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| So I guess my question slash concern is, is this limited to things that are before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5306)|
| 1:28:34| or that will come before the education committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| The Open Records Act, as well as Fancler's opinion to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| is that if it has a possibility to come before the committee, if it's a topic that might come before the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| if it is one that will come before the committee, then it has to be sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Education committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Seeing none, any further business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| I hear a motion to adjourn until 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| So I'm going to see you guys at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt2?start=5358)|
