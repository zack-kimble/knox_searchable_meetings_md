| 0:02:35| I must say, even though Beaumont is not in my district, I'm a little partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| Can you speak into the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| I must say that even though Beaumont is not in my district, I'm a little partial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| because my son attends there and my wife teaches there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| We love Ms. Clayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Our mission at Knox County Schools is to provide an excellent and accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| learning opportunities that empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| These are pictures of some of our students at Beaumont celebrating Black History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| With one of our values at Knox County Schools being that of accessible learning opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| for every child, I just wanted to take a moment to share with you all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| earlier this year during Black History Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| a recent project was put together by 5th grade teachers at Beaumont Magnet Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| I want to give a special shout out to Rachel Kimrey, Brianna Hutchinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| and Heather Davenport, and certainly my wife, who's in the 5th grade there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| We're helping make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| This past February is the 5th grade's celebrated Black History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| They put together a living museum for their peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| On the day of the event, every student in the 5th grade participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| The pride in the cafeteria and hallway where they were set up to perform was palatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| The kids were bursting with pride, and every kid was on a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| That was the most beautiful thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| Every student had done their research and written a report for Black History.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| Every student had memorized lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Every student had a prop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Every student felt successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| The BMA admin team of Wendy Clayton, Tracy Marsh, and Roland Blaine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| was thrilled to see all students get a chance to shine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| Later that day, in an email, they wrote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| We were blown away by your wax museum this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| The kids look great, and you can tell a lot of work went into preparing for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| Thank you for making sure all of our students had props.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| You could not tell the difference between academic levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| SPED, ELL, and everything in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| It was amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Thank you all for your extra work and effort to make this day special for all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| That line there about you couldn't tell the difference between our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| to me, was the thing that hit the hardest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| These students all together were celebrating the history of Black America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| which is something that I think we all need to be more attentive to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| whether or not we're black or white or Asian or Latino,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| to really honor that history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| I'm thankful that BMA took that opportunity to do that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| Now I'd like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for your report this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| A few announcements for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I wanted to provide an update on a very important development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| that could impact how we offer virtual learning instruction for next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| We learned today that the State Board of Education is holding a special call meeting on Monday, April 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| to consider a rule that would affect the ability of school districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| to offer daily virtual instruction in the upcoming school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| That would be a little bit different than what we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| If approved, this rule would require virtual students in Tennessee to unenroll from their base school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| and enroll in a virtual school approved by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| So our plan would be to open, and we've talked about this in our planning for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| three virtual schools, one for elementary students, one for middle school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| and one for high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| So that might be the plan for next year, but we'll learn more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| Each of those schools would have a capacity of 1,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| so a total of 4,500 students, and that's what is required and stated by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| So a virtual learning plan could look a little different next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| but as we learn more, we'll make sure that we get the information out to our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| and also, obviously, the board as we work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| So as a result of this announcement, we're postponing our enrollment window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| for virtual learning for this next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| This will give us more time to obtain guidance about the State Board's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| and to determine our plan for virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| In the meantime, we will continue to have conversations with the State Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Additionally, this postponement will give families more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| to consider the health protocols that our board is expected to vote on next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| before making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| I do apologize for any confusion that this may have caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| However, I do believe that waiting until more information is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| will help every family make the best decision for their student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| I would like to point out that this announcement does not affect our enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| for elementary and middle school summer learning programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| I would also like to highlight two very important public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| that are coming up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Next Thursday evening, April 15, the district will host a community budget meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| We try to host a budget meeting every year, but this year is especially important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| because of the fiscal impacts related to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| In particular, KCS is making decisions about additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| from both the state and federal governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| and we're eager to share more information about our priorities in that regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| and to hear from our community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| In addition, our Disparities in Education Outcomes Steering Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| will host a community meeting on the evening of Tuesday, April 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| We're still finalizing the time and the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| but two important things will be happening at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| As many of you know, the DEO's original five-year mandate is coming to a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| However, we strongly believe the work of promoting equity must continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| and with that in mind, I'll be sharing details about the next phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| of the committee's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| In addition, we will be hosting breakout sessions to get feedback from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| about specific areas, including academics, discipline, personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| student supports and ombudsman, school culture, and communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| Please note that both our community meeting, budget meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| and DEO community meeting will be held in person with additional safety protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=504)|

| 0:08:31| Madam Chair, members of the Board, that concludes my report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Thank you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Do we have any questions for the Superintendent, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Superintendent Thomas, just two quick clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| One, I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Did you just say on the April 15th meeting we will also be discussing the ESSER funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| The ESSER funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| We will be talking about, yes, the ESSER funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| Of course, you know, the Board has to approve any of those expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| I just want to make sure that was going to be a topic of discussion at the budget meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| And then also for those who are considering coming to that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| and possibly the DEO meeting, what kind of public health guidelines will we be following?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| The safety protocols that are in place, we would request that masks be worn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| as best we can do, depending on the number of folks we have there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| that physical distancing be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| We'll move into discussion of our April 14th regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| As we review the agenda, I'd like to move discussion on board policies 7D and 7E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=576)|
| 0:09:45| which are Ms. Henderson's proposed policy change to policy 240 and a new policy J462 to the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=585)|
| 0:09:54| and group them with item 10C, since they have to do with our COVID protocols going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| Please note that the new policy is a policy that would be for this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| The other issues would be for the following school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| That discussion would also encompass agenda item 8 on tonight's work session agenda regarding face coverings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| and allow us to move directly from there to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| Is that all right with everyone if we move those agenda items so we can go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| and kind of knock everything else off the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| Okay, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Okay, so if we could go ahead and look at items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| Do we have any questions on one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Yeah, and actually I have a question about two, and I think it's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| They would be together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Is this Mr. Bolton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Mr. Bolton, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Just looking at these, I mean, one's in Utah and obviously one's in Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| How is it that we're coming about having these partnerships with schools that are so far away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| So that's a great question, Madam Chair, the rest of the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| A lot of times what we have with these, these are not, let me draw a clear distinction between our primary partnership agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| Those would be places like UTK, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, LMU, and also Johnson University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| where we actually push into the programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Typically what happens on these, we have maybe a Knox County student, former Knox County student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| or a Knox County resident that is away in college and they want to do their experience here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| Then we oftentimes will oblige that and enter into an agreement so that we can make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| The one, particularly the Western Governors University, that is a fully online program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| And so we actually have a lot of people who are able to go through the process of achieving their degree in a non-traditional manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=710)|
| 0:11:59| And this is that, the student teaching experience that would allow for them to have that experience in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=719)|
| 0:12:07| The other agreement, Eastern Illinois, that is a situation where we're looking at a person coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| and that is actually a hard to staff position that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| So, yes, there are some. We just draw a distinction between a primary partnership and a partnership agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Thank you, Mr. Bolton. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Okay, so we'll move on into four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=750)|
| 0:12:41| Okay, and then we move into, I believe, all the rest of these regard to prom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| So any questions on six, seven, eight, or nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| Okay, moving into board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| I believe that we've discussed all of these policies previously in our policy review meeting at the first three, A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| Any questions on A, B, or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| Okay, and then we're moving policy J462 and C240 to later on in our agenda to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=788)|
| 0:13:16| Okay, any questions on grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| There's one grant, A. Any questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| Okay, questions on the contracts, A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| Okay, any questions on C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| Okay, moving into regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| We have the calendar, school calendar for 22-23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| That's pretty standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| Okay, no questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Okay, moving into the COVID-19 emergency response plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| No questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Okay, moving into the COVID-19 emergency paid leave plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Do we have an idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| I know it's hard to estimate, but I'm curious what the potential cost of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| Mr. Bolton or Mr. Superintendent, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| No, I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Scott, we've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| I'm not sure if you have a final number at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| I know we've heard from three individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| I'm sure it's probably more than three, but we've heard pretty strongly from three individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| The purpose of trying to do this is that the change was made in mid-school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| If you were unfortunate enough to get COVID the first semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| you got a break because you didn't have to use all your sick leave days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| But second semester, if you happen to be diagnosed with COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| then you used your sick leave days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| So what this would do and allow us to let folks use up to seven days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| this would provide seven days so we could reinstate their sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| Basically be treating employees second semester like they were treated first semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| But I don't know, Scott, if you've got additional information about the cost of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Thank you, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| I think that's spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| I don't think I can add anything to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Gathering the cost is a little difficult because when you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| well, a person may have used their accrual day, so you're paying for a sub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| And so then determining that cost, if you're increasing the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| you're really increasing a liability as opposed to an actual dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| The only reason I ask is I think any time we're making a decision that impacts financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| we should have some sense of the cost if it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| And then I have a second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| And this might be for you too, Mr. Bolton, is does the wording allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| I read through it and I want to confirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| does the wording allow for someone to receive paid time off if they're not feeling well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| and took that time off because of symptoms related to getting the vaccine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| This would not have that provision in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Specifically, what would allow for this to trigger would be if a person would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=964)|
| 0:16:13| for example, be suffering from COVID or caring for a person with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| It would require medical certification in order to trigger this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| However, in that circumstance that you just indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| that would be certainly something that would be under our current sick leave policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| So they could under the current sick leave policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| And now we'll move into discussion and possible actions on protocols related to COVID-19 for the 21-22 school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| and also the two policies that are before us regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| If policy J462 really is in consideration for this school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1016)|
| 0:17:06| can we speak about that one separately first and then move into the next conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| Would that be all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Ms. Henderson, would you like to present this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| So my idea with policy J462 regarding student activities would be pertaining to this current school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| I've noticed a disparity amongst different schools where some schools are going full force with their end of the year activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| whether it be field days, 5th grade activities, 8th grade activities, and some schools that are not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| And I think that by creating this policy, it would encourage all of our schools to hold their normal activities in a safe manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| But then it would create fairness across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Mr. Watson, did your question come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| So just to be clear, because the policy, as we've gotten it, says the 21-22 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| That is a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Well, no, it says we'll go into effect immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| And sunset at the end of that school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| I think, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| So correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| I think, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| So correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| It will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| It will, if voted on and approved, would take effect immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| And because next year still may be affected by COVID protocols, would also go into next year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| And then sunset at the end of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| So it would affect the remainder of this year and this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| So then another question I have is, Ms. Henderson, and I say this with all deference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| Who did you consult in thinking through this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| Mostly parents of the community that I've heard concerns about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Superintendent Thomas, would you mind weighing in, in terms of this policy and giving us your thoughts about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| And let me just start off by saying, certainly we'll do what the board approves us to do with policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| So that part's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| I think the challenges would be, with it, and, again, we can overcome the challenges, but we don't always know what school activities take place out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1146)|
| 0:19:16| That's been, the autonomy is at the school level in terms of the activities that the schools provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| And, again, with that autonomy, the schools, if there's a cancellation for any reason, you know, that happens at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| So we don't always know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| So what we would have to develop, I think, is a system, obviously, where all the schools would need to put their activities, whatever that system is, put all their activities in that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1173)|
| 0:19:46| And then for our grade level directors, our principals would have to go in, or their designee would need to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| And if there's a cancellation, put cancellation in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| And then also, so the reason for that cancellation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| So, you know, it's probably more about some bookkeeping type things, I guess, than it is anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| But we'll do whatever, obviously, the board wants us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| Ms. Henderson, I completely understand why you're proposing the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| And I know my kids have experienced loss and a tremendous amount of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| I think my concern with the policy is, to me, it seems like a purely management issue, which I don't think is necessarily the board's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1219)|
| 0:20:28| And I think I'm especially challenged by the idea of the executive directors reporting to us on a monthly basis related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| And, again, I totally get why you're suggesting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| I just think we need to leave those types of management decisions to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| Yeah, I completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| This isn't requiring schools to have activities, but it's stressing if we can do them, we need to do them for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| So it's not requiring them at any level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| But if we can do them in a safe manner, which a lot of schools are and some schools are not, we need to be consistent across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| Can I suggest maybe a possible recommendation to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Bring it in the form of a resolution that is advocating on behalf of the board to the district to say, please do all you can, instead of making it a policy that becomes a management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1268)|
| 0:21:21| Just a kind recommendation, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Okay, Ms. Baum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Yeah, I mean, and I guess a little bit, I mean, I completely understand and I want all these activities going on whenever I hear anything not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| You know, I feel for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| My concern is probably your second, not the first paragraph so much, kind of encouraging the schools to do all of this, but it is the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| You know, at what level, which activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| I mean, there's so many activities by class, by grade, by subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| You know, and it's like at what level do we start managing the are they happening and not happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| That's kind of what concerns me about this at a policy level is sort of the cumbersomeness of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1319)|
| 0:22:07| So I kind of have a problem with the second paragraph, but I like the fact of encouraging the fact that we try to have all the normal activities for our students in a safe manner this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1327)|
| 0:22:17| So that's kind of where I feel like I'm coming on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| Ms. Anderson, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| No, I completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| I think by keeping it a little bit more vague, I was kind of going for any kind of activities that are just normal, you know, so that way it wasn't limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1344)|
| 0:22:34| But anything that we would do in a normal year we should try to do this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Yeah, I kind of like the idea of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| I mean, I think some of our schools are doing these things anyway, a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| I mean, so, I mean, we're not going to tell them they can't do them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| I mean, so I like the idea of a resolution just saying, hey, you know, it's okay if you feel like you can handle this in your school to, you know, proceed as normal as you normally would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1374)|
| 0:23:12| Otherwise, you know, because I think that my concern with the policy is all these plans that are already taking place, are they going to suddenly be put to a halt if it's not approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1392)|
| 0:23:27| I mean, I like the idea of a resolution just in the sense that it kind of gives more leeway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1407)|
| 0:23:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| I think the way this is worded, just for clarification, is if they're canceling an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| That was your idea, not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Ms. Satterfield, and then we'll go to Ms. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Yes, I appreciate this approach to encouraging, especially since the level that we have come so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| So trying to find that normalcy within our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| My only concern, and I'm not opposed to the resolution either, but my only concern is that I would like this to start after the end of the school year just because of the logistics that might come about of making something like this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1441)|
| 0:24:13| With us only having like less than six weeks to go, I think, I don't know, could be making it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| But it just feels like another burden on our school level staff if we start it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| I look at it somewhat from a fairness standpoint, and I don't mean to step on anybody's toes, pick on anybody, certainly not the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1469)|
| 0:24:46| But in reference to what you were saying, Mr. Watson, the administration sometimes, and that's a broad group when we talk about the administration, for whatever reason, chooses not to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1486)|
| 0:25:07| And when they do not address it, then I think it becomes imperative that from a fairness and consistency standpoint, the board bring it up and do more than just a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1507)|
| 0:25:24| In my opinion, and I know people will disagree with me, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| But a resolution, we don't even need to take a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| We can just say, oh, they kicked it around for about ten minutes and said they would like for us to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1535)|
| 0:25:44| The people that want to do it will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| A resolution, in my opinion, is not a binding or a call to take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1550)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you. Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| I agree. We've seen resolutions passed, and there is no call to action with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| I just think what Ms. Henderson is trying to address is the disparity, or the discrepancy might be a better word, from school to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1571)|
| 0:26:21| And there may be a better way to do it, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| But I think that sending a clear message that we expect you to have these activities, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| I'm all about principal autonomy, but this has been a very unusual year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| And I think that it is very difficult when, in communities where you have two schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| and one school is holding the parade down the hallway for all the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| I know AE was the first school to start it, I think, where the seniors came back to the elementary school to be role models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| And AE does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| But, you know, at another school close to AE, say a Fulton, where the communities intermix, they don't agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| So I just think there may be a better way, but I don't think a resolution is the answer either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| because there is no teeth to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| And I think that the intent was to make sure that all schools are abiding by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| so that all students have the same opportunities as school draws to a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| I think Mr. Watson, then Mr. McMillan, and then Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Yes, Mr. McMillan, I agree that sometimes the board needs to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| So I did talk to every administrator in my district related to this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| and all of them had extreme concern about the management of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| It's not the issue of whether or not we should provide activities for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| I mean, everybody in the district, I think, would be for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| That's not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| It's purely from an execution and management standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| So, Ms. Anderson, I guess what I would say is I can get behind anything that supports our kids experiencing those types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| but if it adds a layer of management to the board, I think that's where my challenge is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| I want to make one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| But before I do, I want to address what Mr. Watson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1704)|
| 0:28:32| Are you saying that some people could address it in one school and others couldn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1712)|
| 0:28:47| Why could somebody do something over here and manage it in this school outside of your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| Or did I misunderstand what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| I'm not talking about the management at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| What I'm saying is that I would guess, if you look back, this board and the history of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| has never been asked to determine whether or not schools are canceling or approving these types of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| And one of the reasons why I think, and I know this is an extreme situation with the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| but the idea of executive directors reporting to us every month about things that are being canceled or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| this board has a lot of really important issues to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| And I don't think that the idea of us getting into the weeds with 89 plus schools about whether or not they're doing traditional activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1774)|
| 0:29:44| I want to encourage it, I want to support it, I want to fund it, I want to do all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| but I don't think this board should be managing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Mr. Watson, we don't have to get into it at 89 schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| if the administrators will do what we tell them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| Or the superintendent tells them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| The superintendent, I'm assuming, whatever we say, the superintendent is going to direct them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| I would be all for the superintendent taking this on and deciding how he wants to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| I'm sorry, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| I'm going to get to my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| And I will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I don't know whether we have any administrators that are of this mindset today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| but a few years back I had an administrator at the high school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| that on more than one occasion told me, and I want you to think about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| that it is easier to ask forgiveness than it is permission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| And that's the way 15 years ago, that's the way a lot of people looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| from administrators, particularly at the high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Ms. Babb, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Yeah, I'm just wondering, like I said, I don't even mind if it's a policy or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| and it's the first paragraph I don't have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| And then the second one, if maybe Ms. Henderson could talk to, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| the head of elementary schools and the head of middle and high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| and just see if there's a way to manage this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| None of us want a burden on our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| I mean, I think we all this year there's been a lot of burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| So, you know, I think your intent is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| How can we do this with your same intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| but not causing undue bureaucracy and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| And maybe just a conversation with them, we can maybe sort this out a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| I'm happy to have that conversation because I am not one to micromanage at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| I'm just trying to provide these activities for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| And, you know, if you cannot provide these activities when other schools can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| why are you not doing that when other schools are doing it in a safe manner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| And, you know, monthly, I'm not talking about a PTO lunch for your teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| I'm talking about big traditional, you know, some schools are having safety patrol this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| some are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Some are doing field days, some are not doing field days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| And so that kind of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| And, you know, I'm not looking to micromanage or make it a burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| but this has been a burden on our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| So that's what I'm trying to take away from the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| So it sounds like that most people can get behind the first paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| The second one, maybe you can have some conversation to figure out a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| But I agree with a couple of the points that have been made that, you know, we govern by policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| I feel like if we pass a resolution, it's a friendly suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| whereas if we pass a policy, it's what we expect to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| And, you know, I think that it does leave room for interpretation unless we have a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| And certainly it seems like with the state of where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| that there would be no reason not to have normal things at the end of the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| and at the beginning of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| So I appreciate your intent with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| and I hope we can figure out a way to come to some agreement on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=1999)|
| 0:33:27| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| And I just have one other question, probably for you, Mr. Diepler, because this is time sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| Is there any way to weigh first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| I can have conversations this week, and we can do second reading next week at the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| I mean, when you ask for the vote next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| you could also ask for a vote before the policy to weigh first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| And again, I mean, you know, the purpose of this meeting tonight is to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| So if you want to make any type of changes, corrections, or whatever you'd like to do to this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| that can be done between now and next week as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Ms. Christie, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| And I can support that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| I think we all want things to be as normal as possible for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| I guess the other concern is the traditional activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| if we could just make sure that that's really clear, that we're not like, you know, not all schools might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| I mean, maybe we shouldn't say what these traditions are because maybe not all schools have headlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| And then, you know, somebody might decide, hey, I want my school to have a headline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| So, I mean, you know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| I mean, you can't list all those traditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| So maybe if you could just say the normal traditions and maybe not say what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2091)|
| 0:34:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| One last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| If you're an administrator and you don't know what the traditional activities that kids do this day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2105)|
| 0:35:14| then you ought to pick up a phone call with some of your colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| or you should resign, one of the two, if you can't figure out something that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| So moving on, I think we're good on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Mr. Thomas, would you like to open our discussion on the topic at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| and then perhaps we'll move to Ms. Henderson's proposal on the mask policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2139)|
| 0:35:48| I'm fine with a little break from this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Thank you, Madam Chair, Members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| I thought it would be important for me to talk about my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| And, again, once again, whatever the Board decides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| obviously I and the staff will make sure that we follow through and carry out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| So I just want you to – I know you know that, but I think I need to say that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| So I know you've received a great deal of feedback about our health protocols for the upcoming school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and certainly I appreciate the opportunity to share my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| But before I do that, I wanted to briefly look back at the efforts we made in preparation for the current school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| And in the reopening plan that we released last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| we outlined our commitment to work closely with the Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| while also taking into consideration guidance from the CDC, the Tennessee Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| Tennessee Department of Health, and then also the Governor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| At that time, the CDC had not yet issued school-specific guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| but we were able to utilize general guidelines that they had provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| until they weighed in more directly regarding K-12 education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| And I think we all knew there would be challenges and bumps along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| and there have been challenges and bumps along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| But I do believe that this approach has incorporated guidance from our local, state, and federal partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| and has served us and our community extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| The district has worked hard to make sure that our policies fit the specific needs and challenges of our 88 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| but the guidance from medical experts at the local, state, and federal levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| have allowed us to reflect best practices and to utilize data and research from a wide variety of informed sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| And I think it's important to note that our approach has allowed our district to hold in-person instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| for 124 out of 133 days, or 93 percent of the days since the school year began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| which I think is outstanding, and it's a testament to the tremendous work of our teachers, administrators, school staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| as well as the dedication and flexibility of our students and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| But I also remind the Board that in many large districts across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| students spent a significant portion of the year with no in-person instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| and in fact, some large school districts are still not back in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| With all that in mind, I'm recommending, based on the ongoing challenges of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| that Knox County Schools continue to follow guidance from the CDC and our local and state health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| I believe this approach will allow us to continue offering in-person instruction to families who want their students in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| while also reassuring our staff and our families that we're taking steps to keep their children safe and healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| Please keep in mind that the guidance we're talking about may change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| and it already has in several ways as the school year progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| We'll monitor that closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| It's also possible that we could receive guidance from the governor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| and that would take precedence over everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| But here's the solution, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| The most impactful action that all of us can take to get our schools and community back to normal is to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| As soon as you become eligible and as soon as the vaccines are made available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| if everyone would do that, I know I can't mandate that, but I just strongly encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| It really sounds like, at this point, to me, a simple solution to trying to get things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| having the activities that our students plan for and look forward to and actually have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| to get back to some sense of normal in our community, just get the vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| And then maybe we don't have to have conversations like this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| So, again, that's just my opinion and how important that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| So, anyway, I'm grateful for everyone that has shared their thoughts with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| and I know we're going to hear more about those thoughts tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| And I think we can all agree on the importance of providing our students with the best educational opportunities possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| And to do that, I believe that we should continue to follow the recommendations of our medical experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| And I'll say one more time than the last time, get a vaccination and maybe we can go back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Thank you, Mr. Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Mixing up my words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Ms. Henderson, would you like to go ahead and talk about your addendum that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| to the face coverings policy to kind of kick us off and let you start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Thank you, Madam Chair and board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| It's been an exciting week doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| So the resolution or the amendment to the policy that I'm offering up with sunset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| the current mask policy for this year while remaining vigilant if the circumstances happen to change by August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| the men that I'm suggesting would have board review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| The board would review the metrics every month to ensure we're getting back to normal while protecting the health of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| I think right now we have the most strict masking policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| All the other surrounding counties around us have more flexible masking policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| And I think as we are getting towards the end of the pandemic, we need to be more flexible with our current policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| Our staff and teachers have been eligible for vaccines since February 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| And by August, everybody will be over the age of 16 will be will have the opportunity to be vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2473)|
| 0:41:21| We've had the lowest cases currently since September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| And again, our most vulnerable have the opportunity to be vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| And I just think we need to offer up a little bit of normalcy while still being vigilant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2489)|
| 0:41:38| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| Other comments, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| Questions I've got. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Superintendent Thomas, I'd like to start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| I've got just a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| Can you tell us why you've been so adamant about following the CDC, Tennessee Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| Knox County Health Department guidelines as it relates to COVID with KCS since the beginning of the pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| I mean, you I mean, every time I hear you talk about it, you're adamant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| This is what you feel like is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| And again, just to say that looking at the success we've had this year, the number of days that we've been in school this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| And, you know, I don't know a lot about a lot of things, if that makes any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| The virus certainly being one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| So my opinion is rely on the medical experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| You know, they they study this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| They study the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Virus has changed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| And and and to me, relying on the medical experts, just that that makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| Maybe it doesn't make sense to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Just the fact that the success we've had by following the guidelines and working with Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| Buchanan and health department and also the Tennessee State Department of Health has allowed us to have the success that we've had this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| So that's why that's why I would recommend following continue to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| And and, you know, those guidelines change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| They've changed some just just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| So they may continue to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I look forward to the day when a guideline is you don't have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| I look forward to a day when the guideline is you don't have to physically distance or any of the things that we've been having to do this this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2594)|
| 0:43:23| So just for me, just relying on on the people, the our medical experts, professionals that that deal with this on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| And one of the questions I've gotten a lot is what would cause the district to go to green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| Because this mask policy, the way it reads, would be lifted if we were green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| And so what's what's what in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| What have you been kind of thinking about in terms of that as you talk to medical professionals and others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| Well, again, I think it would be that no masks are no longer required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| But what would actually cause us to get to green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Do you think what's the what's the litmus test to say, hey, we're green to return to pre-COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| So what we were doing prior to COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Now, I understand that would be the result of going green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| But what what would cause the district to become green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| That's what I'm asking. It's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| So right now we're yellow, correct? Is that right? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Right. So what is it that would that would cause you and the central administration to say we're no longer yellow or green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2657)|
| 0:44:26| I think it would have to go back to our metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| I don't have that with me right now, but but I think our metrics specify what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| So so it's the metrics deal that we're looking at, you're looking at to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| Right. OK. And then one last question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| And I know teachers have gotten vaccinated in lots of different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| But can you give us an idea of how many that we know have been vaccinated because they went through the county schools in East Tennessee Children's Hospital to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| Yeah, the I think the number I think was around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| Correct. Carly. Twenty eight hundred was around 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| Jason, twenty eight, twenty nine hundred out of out of the course we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| I think we probably send out 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| No, I guess the substitutes and so over 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| But but only I think about 4000 responded that they were interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| Jason, do you have those numbers on top of your head? Let me. I'm talking about something I don't really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| I'm sorry. I know we we talked about this about a week ago and I forgot to remind you that I was going to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| Mr. Myers. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. I don't have the exact number in terms of thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| What I can tell you is roughly 55 percent of our eligible employees responded that they did want to have access to the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2738)|
| 0:45:47| OK. And roughly I think it was 20 to 22 percent of those folks had received at least the first dose thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| So I don't have what those numbers are in terms of the specific number of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| But percentage wise, that's where we are at. As of I think last Friday, when I asked for that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| Thank you. We did know people went outside. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| Well, maybe in other places in Knox County and outside Knox County to get vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| Madam Chair, I just want to get your discretion on what's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| I do have other questions for other folks related to this issue, but I'm also good to hold the floor for a minute or to give up the floor for a minute for other people to ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| OK, that'll be fine. We'll we'll come back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| OK, I think Mr. McMillan was next. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Superintendent, in reference to what you said, are you looking at any other so-called experts other than the director of Knox County Health and the CDC director who is new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2798)|
| 0:46:59| The governor's office, if some mandate comes from the governor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| Well, yeah, I understand that, but no, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Those two, you know, the State Department of Health and State Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| You don't look for any other outside sources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| No, sir. Other than those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| So you're willing to stand or fall on what the CDC says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2837)|
| 0:47:29| Well, again, the CDC, our local health department, the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| I mean, what else? What else can I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Well, I don't. I'm honestly glad I'm not trying to be argumentative with you, but I'm trying to illustrate something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| There are doctors who would disagree, who would say that we need to, you know, go on and move toward herd immunity, particularly with kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2863)|
| 0:47:59| They're the least likely to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| And they're, in my opinion, again, everybody may disagree with me, but they're kind of like lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| If you find one that doesn't take your case, go down the street, you probably find one that will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2891)|
| 0:48:20| Probably a good one, maybe even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| So I guess the point I'm trying to stress is, you know, are we willing to risk the kids' future on a couple of people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2903)|
| 0:48:34| I'm not. I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| If things are no worse than they are right now, when fall starts, I'm for doing away with males.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2918)|
| 0:48:48| And that's fine. We can do away with them tomorrow if the board wants to meet and approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| I'm going to ask my recommendation. That's all I'm providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| It's fine. It's fine. I appreciate your recommendation. I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| We've known each other a long time. We respect each other, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| But we were talking about fairness a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| You know, it looks silly to me when fall comes around and we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2955)|
| 0:49:24| okay, the football players can play football and the basketball players can play basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| But nobody else can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| They have contact, but that's the TWSWA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| And there's some kind of a mafia or something. I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| Well, you show me somebody that controls what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2983)|
| 0:49:52| I'm not even sure the governor can do anything with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| And I've been around, heard about them for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| But what I don't want us to get into is next fall being the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| We can play ball because TWSWA says we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| But you other kids, you can't do anything because you're not a part of TWSWA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| That's stupid. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you, Mr. Miller. Ms. Christie, I believe you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| Yeah, I just have a couple of thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| Our reopening plan was just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| I mean, it was written as we were going into the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| I mean, there's so much that we have learned and so much has changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| And I would like to see a shift. I mean, what does green look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| I mean, does vaccine availability and the vaccine, is that not the end game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| And if it's not the end game, what is the end game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Because I think we need to start, instead of talking about being red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| we need to start maybe shifting the focus to how do we get to green rather than who needs to be on red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3066)|
| 0:51:15| I think that's a very valid question, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| Okay, we'll go to Ms. Henderson and then we'll go to Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| I completely agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| I thought the end game was vaccines, but the ball seems to be moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| It was vaccines, now it's children can be vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| Well, not everyone's going to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Well, not everyone gets vaccinated at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| So what is that? That ball keeps moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| And when we talk about the CDC recommendations, we're taking this CDC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| but according to them, we shouldn't have even reopened at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| We shouldn't even be playing sports right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| So why are we picking and choosing CDC recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| And when I look at the COVID metrics for Knox County, we're green in student attendance and teacher attendance right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3114)|
| 0:52:02| If we're green in those metrics, we have the availability for vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| Why are we still continuing this in the fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| But again, if things get worse in August, we can always reexamine this because things are always changing, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| Four months ago, we were red in the worst in the country while still wearing masks, and now we're green in those COVID metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3137)|
| 0:52:26| Okay, let's go to Ms. Bounds and then Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| And then I think most everybody would have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| Ms. Satterfield has her mic down, but I want to make sure we remember that we have Dr. Martha Buchanan here from the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| and we have Dr. Joe Childs from East Tennessee Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| So let's go through the questions that we have, and then why don't we get some feedback from them, and then we'll go back to Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3164)|
| 0:52:55| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| So I think we'll go to Ms. Bounds now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| Okay, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| A medical professional sent me this information that Knox County peaked in December 18th last year with 744 new cases that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3184)|
| 0:53:17| and yesterday we had 53 new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| So if my math serves me, from December peak until now, we're down 92.87% in new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3201)|
| 0:53:30| I wanted to address the additions that Ms. Henderson put to this policy because, as Ms. Christie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3210)|
| 0:53:40| originally line one says emergency measures to respond to that pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| and I don't think any of us, or we might have reconsidered this policy and looked at it a little differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| if we had known a year later that we were bound by this policy and the board would have to re-vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| And I, too, want to know what we have to do to get to green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| But one thing I want to make sure of, whatever passes in regard to this mask policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| is that it's clear, and I think Ms. Henderson has addressed that very well in the red lines there, whatever it is, 12 through 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3250)|
| 0:54:21| Whatever passes, it is clear to everyone that if you choose in person, the mask policy could change depending on the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3261)|
| 0:54:30| The fact that the people are choosing in May or whenever the date is now should not lock us into an entire year of wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3270)|
| 0:54:41| This past year, the argument I heard over and over was we can't drop the mask policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| because people chose based on the fact that we were going to have masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| And they sent their kids to school because we were going to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| And we heard that over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| So I don't want next year for us to be dealing with this where people are saying we can't change the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| because parents chose in May based on, you know, whatever's happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| So I just want to go on record that the board can change this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| And if this is a problem for people returning to school in person, they need to choose virtual or homeschooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| So that's my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| One other quick thing that I want to anecdotally say is my experience with ballparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| I've been in multiple ballparks over the last week, at least four, in different parts, different parts, in four different parts of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3333)|
| 0:55:42| even inside the city at a city-owned Enron ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| And do you know how many masks I saw in those four evenings at the ballpark with quite a few people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3346)|
| 0:55:56| One. One mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| There was a high school team playing, a middle school team playing, and six rec league teams practicing on every field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3361)|
| 0:56:10| There were no kids in masks, no parents in masks, no siblings in masks, no grandparents in masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3370)|
| 0:56:19| And these were, you know, these are the people who always say we're trying to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| and our kids have to wear masks to school because they may get COVID and come home and give it to grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| There were no grandparents in masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| And as I sat there, I just thought about the inconsistency and hypocrisy of all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| These kids are living their lives, but they come back to school the next day and they are asked to mask up for eight to 10 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3399)|
| 0:56:50| And if this isn't out of fear, I want to know why we're asking them to mask when the night before they're all over the county without masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3410)|
| 0:56:59| So anyway, I just want to make that people aware that we are going well beyond the mask mandate in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3419)|
| 0:57:09| So that's my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Thank you, Ms. Bounds. Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| Yes, and I really liked what Ms. Bounds said about parents understanding when they make their decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| because I think both either of the either Ms. Henderson's policy or the recommendation by Mr. Thomas, both call for possible changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3440)|
| 0:57:32| So, I mean, I've gotten emails from people that if there are masks next year, there's no way they can be in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| And I've gotten emails from people that if we don't, you know, on both sides that there's no way they can send their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| And I think where we are right now, no matter which one we go with, there could be changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| And people have got to realize when they make a choice, because I do have a problem right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| and I'm sort of leaning towards Mr. Thomas's recommendation, but only with the fact of knowing that things could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3475)|
| 0:58:04| Because I'll tell you right now, I cannot in good conscience in April try to pass something saying May 2022 we would require kids to have masks if things continue to get better and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3484)|
| 0:58:14| And so I just want parents, as they're making their decision, to realize no matter where we go on this, that there could be changes along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3494)|
| 0:58:23| We're probably not either one of these things don't make us completely one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| But I believe Dr. Childs with Children's Hospital is here, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but I guess could I ask you a few questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| I feel like I've gotten a lot of emails quoting you. So I was like, guess what? We're going to have Dr. Childs here himself. I'd like to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| Let me apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| Well, and I think sometimes people take out bullet points as they want to interpret them and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| So that's why I appreciate you coming here and I appreciate you talking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| I think what we kind of keep hearing from parents is kids aren't getting sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| Kids are not at risk. Kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| Why are we doing mass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| So as an authority with Children's Hospital, can you kind of come down and give us your opinion as a medical professional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3543)|
| 0:59:10| And this is one reason I do think it's nice that you're here because you are a different medical professional than the health department and the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| And I don't know what you're going to say, but if you could kind of say what you think about how we're moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| what you've thought about the mass this year, that kind of stuff, because I know there's the balance, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| And I understand it of balancing the safety of mass versus the mental health issues that people are worried about with kids wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3567)|
| 0:59:38| Well, that was a lot. Is it OK if I remove my mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| First of all, nothing. I've said this before publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Nothing but love for the school board and Knox County Schools and what you all have accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| I think it's extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| I don't think you had a choice from a mass standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| I think there was so much unknown as you looked at the school year last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| And as a parent, grandfather and a citizen, I think you made the choices you had to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3605)|
| 1:00:14| We're in a different world now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| We know so much more about this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| We are seeing declining numbers, certainly in terms of cases and especially hospitalizations and deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3621)|
| 1:00:29| As the vulnerable population has been vaccinated, the results are what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| And that is the serious cases are definitely declining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| Now, what impact has this had on kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| We've admitted about 60 kids with COVID over the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Most of those were not seriously ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| Some of them were not ill with COVID at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| They just tested positive and they're at Children's for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| We've had a handful of very serious cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| And we've had a handful of very serious cases of complication of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| The MISC, it's pretty uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| But that multi-inflammatory syndrome that occurs three to four weeks after you've had COVID is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| And it's a significant problem, but treatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| My perception on the mask issue when schools masked was not as much worry about protecting the kids because they get COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3677)|
| 1:01:27| And we don't want people to get COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| But they don't even starting out in China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| It was not a serious illness for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| And that's with few exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| That's still true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| I thought the masks were really to protect the teachers and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| And because that's a vulnerable population in a variety of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3706)|
| 1:01:55| Age wise, their own health and illnesses and problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| So now we're in the vaccine world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| And it's universally available to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| And I'm disappointed at the numbers of if they're accurate on who has vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| But it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| And that is 100% prevention of serious illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| You can still get COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Maybe 5, 10% can still get COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| But the incidence of serious COVID in someone that's vaccinated is essentially zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| And I think Dr. Buchanan will agree with me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| And the vaccine is incredibly safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Now, I don't want to demean the first dose and especially the second dose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| You may not feel great for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| But in terms of serious side effects, it's one of the safest vaccines ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| It's one of the scientific marvels of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| The messenger RNA vaccines and now the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| So that is the way out of this is vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| So then I can't tell you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| I can just try to inform you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| But from my perspective, the protection of teachers and staff issue is solvable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3794)|
| 1:03:23| But to me, that's not a mask issue anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| It's a vaccination issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Second, what about kids who may be more vulnerable to this virus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| What about them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| So we're in a very different situation now than we were last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| We have treatment available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| In fact, if a high-risk 12-year-old or up gets COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| we can give them an infusion of monoclonal antibodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| and they have almost zero risk of progressing to serious illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| We've done that probably 20 times at children's over the last couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| when those became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| So it's different in that regard in terms of what does COVID mean to the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3846)|
| 1:04:16| And finally, there's vaccination for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| Now, where is that going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Now, we know a number of 16- and 17-year-olds have chosen to vaccinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| And, you know, what I hear as a citizen is a lot of that is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| they want to not have the interruption to their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| because they get exposed to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| They want to play sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| They want to participate in activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| They want to be in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| So I'm excited that 16- and 17-year-olds are vaccinating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| and probably 12-year-olds and up could be able to vaccinate soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| based on the really amazing data that's being presented to the FDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| and hopefully will be approved to lower the age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| especially for Pfizer, by mid to end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| So it is a different world now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| I've never been impressed that, as a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| that the kids are wearing the masks very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| But the solution is not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| The long term is we've got to vaccinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| So I guess those are my random thoughts to your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| I hope I answered some of those for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| Can I ask a follow-up question on one of your points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| You spoke about the vulnerable kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| So would you classify that as students who have some underlying health issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| that is known to their parents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| So are you speaking about those kids that have underlying health issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| If they got COVID, do you feel like it would be treatable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| I just want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| The FDA has approved that treatment for a number of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| The most vulnerable population we have seen are the extremely overweight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| That is an incredible risk factor, even for teenagers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| Can I ask just a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| Something else I'm just seeing in the news is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| and I'm probably going to say it wrong, variant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| I've seen some stuff saying that children are more vulnerable to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| I had someone call me panicked in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| that there was no way we could open school this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| because the variant was coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| And I said, you know, we have to deal with things as they're happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| If I had listened to this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| I would have been against us being in school all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| But what I'm asking is, are there any concerns from the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| and what you all are seeing and maybe hearing from other countries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| or other places around the country that we're worried about things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| Well, the data that's available to us, the U.K. variant is the leading variant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4019)|
| 1:07:07| It is more contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| I don't think there's data that suggests it's more dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| from a making you sicker standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| There's been some debate about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| But when you're talking about having to be nimble for next year based on what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| I think that's what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| is what happens with the variants that we know about and the variants that we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| Because we're not achieving such high numbers of vaccination in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| and in the country and worldwide, the risk of variants is perpetuated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| because it's still out there infecting people and potentially mutating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| and changing into forms that can be more dangerous for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| That can all be stopped by vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| But we can't fix the world, but we can fix our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| And I think what Dr. Buchanan has been stressing in terms of vaccination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| is absolutely the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| But what we know about the variants right now is that they're just more contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| And so, again, all the more reason to vaccinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Do we have specific questions for Dr. Childs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| Do you have any questions for Dr. Childs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Okay, go ahead, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| Dr. Childs, I'm pretty sure I was on a call with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| when you talked about your concerns around mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| related to kids and the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| Can you kind of weigh into your thoughts on the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| and I know you're not a mental health professional per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| but can you weigh in on that particular issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| And do you have any specific thoughts related to mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| and the connection to masks specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| I don't think anybody would say that the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| has not had a mental health effect on our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| Do you have any connection between that and masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| Well, I mean, at Children's we have seen numbers we've never seen before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| in terms of mental health issues, whether that be suicide, depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| or other behavioral changes that we are attributing to the isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| and the stress of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| There's a lot of home stress, whether that's economic, food uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| But isolation is a really big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| I think personally I tie that more to not being in class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4164)|
| 1:09:33| as much as I would tie it to masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| But masks affect a lot of special needs kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| and certainly they affect our ability to communicate as effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| because you're not seeing the communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| and the facial expressions and things as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| So that may have some effect on some of the behavioral changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| But I think it's much more the isolation and stress pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| Any other questions for Mr. Childs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Dr. Childs, thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Chair Bork, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| And if I could ask Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| so just currently I believe that your website shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| that about 900 people currently are COVID positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| which is like less than 0.2% of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| I'll trust that you've looked at those numbers, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| I haven't looked at them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| Yes, so I look at it every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| So I know the percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| You can ask me any day what percent of Knox Countians have COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| I probably know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| I know what time you'll come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| 11 o'clock, 1105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| I'm probably on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| So I look at it every day because it's important to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| to keep up with what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Because I really think that a lot of people have a very misconstrued notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4253)|
| 1:11:02| of how many people have COVID, first of all, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| Because I had an email today from a, I don't remember if it was a parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| or I think it was actually a psychologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| somebody with a medical background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| And she talked about that she's working with a child whose parents died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| and they think the parents died of COVID, and they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| But kids particularly have a vision that everybody has COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| So I think even I've seen some surveys to just people on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| how many people in the United States do you think have COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| And people have a view that it's much higher than it actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| So I think that's one thing that there's been so much fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| that people don't have a realistic view of how many people actually have COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| have had COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| So over time, less than 10% of our population here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| has COVID positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| So right now where we are at just a very small percentage, .19%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| so knowing that and what the trend has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| what Ms. Bounds talked about with the trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| do you feel like we're getting to a point where we can get rid of the mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| because of just that we're improving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Kind of what is the end game, I guess, is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| Because like Ms. Henderson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| everybody's done everything they've been asked to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| and yet it seems like it's not enough yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| So when is it enough, I guess, is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| And I think it's important that we look at local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| What's happening here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| What's happening locally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Let's make local decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Well, unfortunately, COVID-19 determines the end game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| COVID-19 itself changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| It mutates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| We have variants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| It's constantly changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| The job of a virus is to survive and be passed on to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| And COVID-19 is very efficient at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| So because of changes, I can't say to you on, you know, July 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| we're going to be able to make everybody's masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| But I guess the question is, is it going away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| Or is this something that's just going to be here, like the flu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| I think we'll have cases of COVID going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| It won't surprise me if COVID vaccine becomes part of the annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| or periodic vaccines that we all get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| That wouldn't surprise me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| We are improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| It looks a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Like Dr. Child says, we're in a different place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| Vaccine is the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| And as a board, rather than focusing on masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| focus on getting your staff vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| I don't know how you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| but I don't know if there's a way for you to encourage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| But getting your staff, all of them vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| or as many as are willing to take the vaccine, is really the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| You know, when we closed schools down during this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| we seldom closed because of disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| We closed because of an administration decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| because there weren't enough teachers or enough, you know, staff to have school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| So those staff won't have to quarantine if they get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| It will change the game for the schools and for your staff and for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| So it is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Things are much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| And I'm thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| The schools have done an amazing job of keeping kids healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| and keeping them in school as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| And it's been because of the things that we've had in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| that we haven't had terrible, big, giant clusters throughout the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| We've had clusters primarily in your athletic department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| because nobody's wearing masks and they're all being exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| Not many clusters in the classroom, which is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| It shows that what they're doing is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| So I would still say following the CDC's recommendations is the best route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| And the American Academy of Pediatrics continues to recommend masks at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| CDC continues to recommend masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| But those are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| I mean, they just came out with, you know, if you've been vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| you can do these things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| So the recommendations change based on vaccination rates and disease rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| And so I can't predict, and none of you can predict, what it's going to be in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| what the COVID situation is going to be in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| So I would argue that what you're doing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| you still have the flexibility to change your policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| and, you know, making sure you communicate that with your parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| that it could change based on the situation, based on the local situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| based on the national recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| And so you have that flexibility built in already, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| So do you worry at all about our students' mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| because of the effect that wearing this mask all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| and the lack of interactions they have with teachers and students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| I mean, do you worry about the mental health of our students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Because, to me, the masks are an issue because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| Of course I worry about the mental health of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| I live in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| I have nieces and nephews who went to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| They're all grown up now, and I'll have great nieces and nephews who go to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| So, yes, I worry about the mental health of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| But I also have to consider the health of your teachers and your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| and the health of those students who some may be vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| and may have higher complication rates than others from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| So it's a balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| You guys are being asked to do a balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| We're being asked to do a balancing act, balancing disease and mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| and what's the best thing to do to keep the most kids in school and keep educating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| I guess I feel like if we have a vaccine and we've offered, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| Children's has been great to partner with us to make it so easy for our staff to go and get the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| If people choose not to do that, that's their health choice, and they certainly have a right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| But they have the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| They have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| So I feel like that has to play into the conversation because we've talked about the decreased risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4617)|
| 1:17:06| It's basically 100 percent survivable for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| It's not 100 percent survivable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| Well, 99.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| Not 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Okay, 99.8 I think is the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| But I said nearly 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| So also, can you talk about what your thoughts are about contact tracing for fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| Contact tracing will continue to be part of what we do and part of what the schools continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| The schools have done a great job with contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| And I spoke last time when I was here about how careful they are about determining who has to quarantine and who doesn't have to quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4654)|
| 1:17:44| They watch video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| They are being so careful because they want to keep every kid in school they can and they want to keep every teacher at school they can without putting anybody at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| So we will continue to be doing some contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| The guidelines have changed a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| Fully vaccinated folks don't have to quarantine and some other things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| So that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| Again, another reason to encourage vaccination among your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| So we'll continue to do contact tracing as long as we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| And I don't know when that need will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| We contact trace for everything, not just COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| We don't contact trace for flu, but we contact trace for a lot of things to reduce risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| And as our numbers go down, you know, you're going to have fewer cases in school, therefore fewer people out in quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| And I'm assuming, I know the guidance recently changed to three feet instead of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| I'm not sure that's what we're doing in schools right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Six feet is preferred and the guidance on that is really kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| Because it's also based, not funny, but it's based on like in elementary schools, I think they're recommending three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| And then in high schools, they prefer that you have six feet still because there's more transmission in those older kids than there are in the younger kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4731)|
| 1:18:59| So it's a little complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| And it hasn't changed for contact tracing, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| They haven't changed the recommendation for contact tracing to be three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| It's still six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| So you can still consider contact if you are within six feet of another person for more than 15 minutes over a 24 hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4754)|
| 1:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Ms. Satterfield, you haven't had the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Do you have a question for Dr. Buchanan while she's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| So we'll come back to you if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Do we have questions for Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Mrs. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| I want to go back to the masking policy a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| So I've spoken to leaders in the surrounding school districts to Knox County as well as some private schools this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| And all of them seem to have more flexible policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| Some don't require them below eighth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| Yet they've been in school all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| I know a particular school district that has not gone on red or all year long with kids eighth grade and under not masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4793)|
| 1:20:04| So how come their numbers are so low with flexible masking policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| Well, I think honestly every school uses a different metric to decide red, yellow, blue, green, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4809)|
| 1:20:19| So those metrics are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| Knox County Schools is very thoughtful and very thorough in deciding what their metrics would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| And so without knowing what their metrics are, I can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| How are they making those decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| I don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| So I can't answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Well, I was looking at Texas and California have had a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4837)|
| 1:20:45| Georgia and Florida have not had a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Yet the trend is exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| I talked to a private school this week that I think Knox County Schools, I want to say about six and a half percent of our staff kids combined have probably been COVID positive this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4850)|
| 1:21:05| This private school that I spoke with, their percentage without wearing a mask like we do, they wear them in common spaces, not in the classroom, is like 7.1 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4865)|
| 1:21:16| So, you know, the percentage is very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| So it's interesting that the trends seem to be the same regardless of whether you are a mask mandate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| Do you have any comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| I would argue it's hard to say what it would have been without a mask mandate here because we just don't know because we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| And our students and our staff have been wearing masks to protect each other and protect their families and protect our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| And that's what I have to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| And so we don't have a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| We don't have a crystal ball to predict the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| And I don't have a way to know what it would be like if we didn't have masks in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| Other questions or comments for Mrs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Yeah, I want to ask a little bit in this really and get to mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| But it's more talking about we keep distressing vaccines, vaccines, vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| And, you know, I read one of the daily things that kind of talks about how many people are vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4920)|
| 1:22:08| I'm thinking those are the numbers you'll know from Knox County because I feel like those are very skewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| I feel like our numbers are so much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| I mean, as an example, I know two of our board, me included, went through the vaccine trial, which we're probably not counted in numbers that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4935)|
| 1:22:23| I probably have five other friends that went through Pfizer and Moderna trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| I probably have my friend group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| I would say over half of them have gone out of the county to get their vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| And then I even know like one of the high schools in my district, before children start giving them, it was getting almost to be a problem how many teachers were leaving to go to other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4954)|
| 1:22:43| So I feel like when we're looking at our numbers and we're even saying like, you know, children's has given this many vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| It's not I mean, I'm thrilled to know those numbers, but I feel like it's not really reflective of Knox County and how many people really are vaccinated because I'm getting to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4969)|
| 1:22:59| I mean, like yesterday I call to get unblinded in my study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| I had to get a vaccination and I called summit and literally they're like, you can come today, tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| I mean, it was like no problem to get a vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| So, I mean, it's like right now, if you want one, it seems like it's available to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| And vaccine availability is really increasing and that's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| So just back to the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| So the numbers that we use, so everybody who gives COVID vaccine is required as part of their CDC provider agreement to enter the vaccination information into their state's vaccine registry within 72 hours of giving the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=4999)|
| 1:23:35| And so we pull that information out of that registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| So we're not just looking at what we give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| We look at look at it based on county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| So when we pull those numbers out, it's people who live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| It's agnostic to where they got their vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| We don't look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| We just look at, do they live here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| And that's how many people in Knox County who, who've been vaccinated and they're supposed to enter those trial vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| They're supposed to enter those too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| I'm not sure if that's happened, but they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| So that's, we're really looking seriously just at Knox County residents who've been vaccinated by whomever they got vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Well, no, I'm, I'm glad to know that and get that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Cause I was like, God, I feel like half the people I know did not get their shot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| But when y'all are counting, you are counting number of residents that have gotten vaccination, no matter where in the state they've gotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| Even if they went to North Carolina and got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| We're counting all those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| You may have already said what percentage in Knox County at large have gotten, been vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| I'm going to look at Catherine for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| We have, I know it's over 20% have had at least one dose of vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| Fully vaccinated is a lower number, but we're over 20, over 20%, close to 30%, I believe, which is fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5080)|
| 1:24:47| But it's a long, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Oh, 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| I should look at my data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| 32% have been vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| I haven't had at least one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| And so, and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| And you know, it's a long way from 70, but we're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Other questions while, yes, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Dr. Buchanan, I just got four questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| Only four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| So, and you started giving, started saying some of this, but if you can just recount just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| Can you give a brief account of how some, how the COVID guidelines have reduced or shifted since the start of the pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| Because one of the things that I have heard a lot from a lot of constituents is when is this thing going to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| It's not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| Things are still difficult and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| But my observation personally has been things seem to have continually loosened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| So, can you just give a brief account of how things have loosened up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| So, are you talking about guidelines or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| Protocols related to COVID in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| So, if we're talking about, so I'll just stick with the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| So, you know, at the beginning, you had to be a contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| It was 10 minutes or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| Now we're 15 minutes or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| That made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| So, that loosened some things up because that meant some people were not considered a contact anymore because they were not in that close contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| And, you know, just as we've learned things, we've, you guys, you went back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| You successfully had students in school learning and students didn't have to stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| I didn't realize there were so many school districts across the country where they were virtual the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| I just didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| And so, I applaud you all in the school system and superintendent and staff for getting kids back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| That's part of relaxing things and doing different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| You know, we had a stay-at-home order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| We don't have a stay-at-home order anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| People can go out and go out to eat and go out and go grocery shopping and do the things that they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| You guys are playing sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| You got to play sports this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| And you got to have other extracurricular activities this year, some of those you didn't have last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| So, I mean, I think we've really loosened those things up and changed based on the data, based on information that the CDC is gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5220)|
| 1:27:09| Knowing that vaccines are effective, we now can say if you're fully vaccinated, you don't have to quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| We couldn't say that before because we didn't know how effective the vaccine was going to be going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| So, all of those things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| I think they're talking about extending how long they think you have protection if you have disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| how long you're protected against getting sick again from three months to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| So, as the evidence rolls in, they change the guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| And we've changed as a community based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| Yeah, I don't know how everybody else in this room feels, but I know the first two months of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| I don't think I've left my property very much unless it was, I mean, I happen to be able to work from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| I had the privilege to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| But, I mean, I feel like I, I mean, I feel fairly free in the way that I'm navigating the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| Let me ask you two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| So, one question you answered at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| So, you just got two left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| So, one of the things I've heard a lot from all kinds of folks is that masks don't work and kids have a very low rate of transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| Is that true in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| And if so, if it is true, why would we continue to mask kids in school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| Masks do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| That ship has sailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Masks do reduce risk and decrease transmission for adults, for kids, for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| This is a respiratory disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| You put a mask on there on your face and you keep from having droplets go in or out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| So, they do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| As far as children transmitting COVID, there's some new data suggesting that they may transmit at the same rate as adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5319)|
| 1:28:49| I don't think that's finally decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| I just read something the other day that's suggesting that children transmit, may transmit as much as adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5332)|
| 1:28:59| And I don't know, Dr. Childs might have more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| But I think that's still being looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| And then my last question is, and this is a legitimate, full of integrity question because I'm as confused as a lot of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5346)|
| 1:29:15| And I'd love to have somebody here from the CDC, but nobody would come at my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| So, I want to ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| Why at this point, and I know the CDC is a federal organization and we're looking at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5363)|
| 1:29:29| Why at this point in the pandemic, in your mind, is the CDC still officially recommending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5369)|
| 1:29:37| And I know we're not suggesting a change for this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| I don't think that's what the board is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| It's looking for next year, which a lot of things can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| But why at this point in your mind, would the CDC continue to recommend masks in schools when we are at this place in the pandemic and we do have access to vaccination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5384)|
| 1:29:56| Well, I think, one, vaccine, though it's easier to get than it was, we still do not have enough vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5396)|
| 1:30:04| That all loosened up pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| I mean, like now everybody in 16, I mean, like recently it loosened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| It did loosen up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| But we don't have enough vaccine to vaccinate everybody who wants to get vaccinated yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| We will eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| So, until we have the ability to really have vaccine available to anybody who wants to get vaccinated, I think we're going to still have to keep some guidelines in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5416)|
| 1:30:26| And, you know, I'm fully vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| But when I go out or when I go somewhere, I'm going to wear this mask because I don't know if you live in a house with somebody who's elderly and I might make you sick and you take it home to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5429)|
| 1:30:38| So, I don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| So, that's why they continue to recommend masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I think we've got to reach a better level of vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| Across the country, globally across the country, you're still, at least one dose of vaccine, you're still in the 30 percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5444)|
| 1:30:53| So, we need to get that number higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| So, Dr. Buchanan, your mask is stylish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Do you like masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| No, I don't like masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| So, I want to make an observation, and I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that everybody who's spoken to this issue tonight, including you and Dr. Childs and everybody on the board, I don't think anybody likes masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5461)|
| 1:31:13| I mean, I don't know anybody who does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| And what I've also consistently heard is that everybody is in agreement that vaccination is the endgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| I mean, that's what we need to do is get more people vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| Let me, I'm a little confused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Just help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| So, you had COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| You're fully vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| And you wear a mask so you won't give it to anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| I just, I really don't understand because my medical professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| Allow me to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| There is still a slight possibility that I could contract COVID again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| I wouldn't be sick at all, but I could transmit virus into the air and make somebody else sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| So, what are the odds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| We need more data on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| What are the odds of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| I mean, I don't find a lot of information out there where people have had, there are people that have, I'm not denying that, but multiple cases of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5527)|
| 1:32:19| What is the data on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| We've had folks get reinfected in Knox County and we, in Tennessee, there have been fully vaccinated folks who contract COVID as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| They're not, the cases are not very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| They don't result in hospitalization, but they're, and they're mild cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| So, the people with the mild cases are the ones who are more likely to transmit disease to others because they go about their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5554)|
| 1:32:40| They don't feel sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| They don't, aren't sick enough to stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| So, they go about their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| And until the CDC guidance changes on that, I will continue to wear a mask as long as I don't know the situation of the people around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| So, so this, there's no end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| No, there is an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| I mean, there is an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| Just right now, we don't have enough people vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| That's, that's our challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| Here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| That's when we quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| I didn't mean to interrupt you, but some people believe that when the last person, you know, as long as we have just a handful of cases, we should still all wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5586)|
| 1:33:18| We'll see what the CDC's recommendations are at that point, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| Mr. McMillan, did you have a question for Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| Yes, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| I know Ms. Henderson also has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| You were first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| Go ahead, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| Okay, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| I just got, well, I had four of Ms. Bounds ask one about the continuing to wear a mask after you'd had the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5613)|
| 1:33:43| I would think the odds would be extremely high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| You know, I think it's more of a personal preference after 30 days passed and you've had the second vaccine, no matter where you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5628)|
| 1:34:00| When you contacted the vaccine, did you contact trace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5640)|
| 1:34:08| I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| Did you contact trace where everybody that you had come in contact with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5651)|
| 1:34:20| My staff did that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| Staff did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| Our contact tracers, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Just I was treated like any other case, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| Roughly how many people did they come in contact with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| It was very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| I don't know, and I'm sorry, I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| This is a yes or no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| Do you believe the CDC has become somewhat more politicized in the last 30 to 45 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5681)|
| 1:34:51| Actually, sir, I believe it's been less politicized in the last 30 days, but that's a matter of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| But I'm glad to hear yours because it tells us something about what you're thinking, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| You remember when the UT students lined up, they were on TV, all lined up trying to get in bars over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5709)|
| 1:35:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| Did you and the mayor of the city, Ms. Kincannon, did you all make any effort to do anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5719)|
| 1:35:31| So what we did is my staff, who inspect restaurants and bars, worked with those owners to help correct those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5731)|
| 1:35:43| and educate them and advise them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| You'd have to ask Mayor Kincannon what she and her team did in regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| How long did it take for it to stop, for your staff to get it stopped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| I don't think we were successful in stopping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| Changing human behavior is quite challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| So I guess if you weren't successful, then the authority lies with the police department under Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5761)|
| 1:36:15| And apparently she chose to ignore it because, to my knowledge, there never was anything really done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5775)|
| 1:36:24| Again, that would be a great question for her police chief or Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Ms. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Thank you, Madam Chair and Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Dr. Buchanan, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Help me understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| So I go to the gym every day, multiple gyms, and I wear a mask inside, but once I'm at my equipment, I take that mask off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5795)|
| 1:36:43| When I'm at a restaurant, I walk in, I wear a mask, but once I'm sitting down, I take my mask off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| I'm breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| I mean, when you're at a gym, let's be honest, I have my mask off, you're breathing heavily, but you're in the building with a ventilation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5809)|
| 1:36:58| What's the benefit of wearing that mask walking in if I'm taking it off if I'm sitting at a restaurant or working out at the gym every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5818)|
| 1:37:06| You're just reducing risk to others around you and reducing risk to yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| That's what you're doing by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| I still don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| You're reducing risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| We're still breathing the same air, though, in that same building that I wore a mask in and now I'm not wearing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| I'm still there if I'm sick or not sick, breathing without a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| It's just risk reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Cannon, one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| How have you seen, and I know causality is a little difficult here, but how have you seen COVID guidelines, protocol related to COVID, have a positive impact on public health in Knoxville in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5856)|
| 1:37:50| Have we seen a reduction in flu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| How do we connect some of the positive things we've been doing around public health in terms of how it's impacted public health in general in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5874)|
| 1:38:04| Yeah, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Yes, our flu numbers are the lowest I've ever seen them in my tenure here at the health department for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5886)|
| 1:38:14| And respiratory visits to children were down and all our hospitals were down for other types of respiratory illness because of all the things we're doing to reduce the risk of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5894)|
| 1:38:23| So, and I think this is really important to say, and I think a lot of people that are out here that are cheering would understand why I'm saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5903)|
| 1:38:32| There is no doubt, and it's been stated tonight, that the pandemic has had an effect on our mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| As a community, as a society, as a world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| But we've also seen it have some of the things that we've done to mitigate COVID and have a positive effect in terms of overall public health, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5923)|
| 1:38:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| In some areas, infectious disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| That's really where you're going to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| I only say that because I think what you stated earlier is everything in this pandemic has to be weighed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5942)|
| 1:39:09| And I don't think anybody is for increase in negative mental health, nor is anybody for increase in physical health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5949)|
| 1:39:17| And so it is this, and I think that's the tension that everybody's hearing in this board, is that there's no universally accepted, this is the right risk factor that we have to use here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5957)|
| 1:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| And does natural immunity to this come into play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| So if 30% of people have been vaccinated, if another, you know, whatever, 10% have had COVID, then there are some people who may be naturally immune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5977)|
| 1:39:47| So is there, I've heard maybe around a 70% herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| Is that generally accepted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| Is that the goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| And are those things being factored in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Kind of, can you talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| So natural immunity from this disease we don't believe is long-lasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| So we believe the science tells us that vaccination is a better way to achieve immunity to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6004)|
| 1:40:13| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| So we're not sure how long natural immunity lasts, and we don't think it's as lasting as vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| So for that reason, we're relying on vaccine for herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| And we do want to reach 70% to 85% of our population with vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| So we do have quite a ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| Certainly folks who've had disease and are in that window of 90 days where they're unlikely to get reinfected, those folks do contribute to the herd immunity for those 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6029)|
| 1:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| Do you have, I know one of the studies that I saw, but it was actually on the CDC website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6041)|
| 1:40:50| this was in regard to non-pharmaceutical measures for pandemic influenza in non-healthcare settings, personal protective and environmental measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6050)|
| 1:40:59| So there was a paper to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| And it states that proper use of face masks is essential because improper use might increase the risk for transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6061)|
| 1:41:12| So, you know, I think, and I have a, I don't know if you're familiar with this Swiss, let's see, the Swiss research policy organization that it's a non-partisan Swiss, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6072)|
| 1:41:33| They gather together, let's see, Swiss policy research founded in 2016 is an independent nonpartisan and nonprofit research group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6093)|
| 1:41:43| So they have lots of different studies on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| And I believe this is where this was referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| So they have a lot of data on their, on their sites about the effectiveness of or lack thereof of face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6109)|
| 1:41:59| And so one of the, you know, a few of these studies have indicated that you could have increased risk because, you know, and I'm thinking particularly with regard to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6119)|
| 1:42:09| Because if you have children who are, you know, their mask falls to the bathroom floor and they put it on their face or they, you know, sneeze in it or they wipe their dirty hands on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6129)|
| 1:42:19| All kinds of disgusting things that you can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| So, so the CDC's website says proper use is essential because improper use could increase the risk for transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6142)|
| 1:42:31| So I think that to me as a, you know, as a parent, I think that that's what I've heard from a lot of parents who are concerned about that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6151)|
| 1:42:39| Their kid is wearing this nasty, dirty cloth on their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| So, you know, I think that I just wonder if you have any response to that because I think we have to look at people are responsible for their own individual health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6164)|
| 1:42:52| So you have to look at the health of that child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| You know, is that healthy for the child?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| So it's our responsibility as adults to teach children how to do the things they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| We teach them how to wash their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| We teach them how to brush their teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| And in this instance, children now need to be taught the proper way to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| It's part of our responsibility as adults to do that for our children and help them learn how to do that properly and protect themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6191)|
| 1:43:18| And yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| People who don't wear masks properly, you know, they're at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| They're putting others at risk for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| But, you know, it's our responsibility as adults to teach our children those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| And we teach them all those other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| Right now, during COVID, we need to teach our children about wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| Mrs. Henderson, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair and Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Just to follow up on that, when I wear my mask, I play with it about 50 times a day, where normally I would not touch my face at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| But so back to the vaccinations, we know that not everyone will choose to be vaccinated, and that's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6231)|
| 1:43:59| But at what point do you think, what number to you is a point, is a good percentage of, okay, now we can let up on some more of these restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6239)|
| 1:44:13| What's your magic number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| There's no magic number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| The recommendation from the CDC is 70 to 85 percent of your population needs to be vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| We may not get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| But when we know we've saturated the need or the desire for vaccine is when we have ample vaccine and nobody's getting vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6264)|
| 1:44:32| That's when we know we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| Because people have either chosen to get vaccinated or they haven't and they're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| And so that's when we know we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| I don't think it'll be at 70 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| We don't get those numbers for flu shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| And people are really comfortable with flu shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| So that's how we'll be able to see that as a community when we have vaccine that just doesn't get used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| Right now we're not in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| I know it's not that hard to find a vaccine appointment right now because it's improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| But we certainly haven't saturated the market of people who want the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| And then there's some people out there who are still going, I don't know, I want a few more people to get vaccinated before I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| And those folks need to get vaccinated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| And then we've got all our children who hopefully vaccine will be available for them and we need to get them vaccinated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6311)|
| 1:45:18| So it's really, there's no magic number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| Those are the numbers recommended by the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| I'm skeptical that we'll get there just because I'm looking at flu data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| I'm not sure we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| But we do need to have that opportunity and have enough vaccine in our community for anybody and everybody who wants to get vaccinated to get vaccinated and our kids to get vaccinated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6328)|
| 1:45:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6342)|

| 1:46:41| And I also know that we are, that is the individual, but we are a governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| body that's responsible for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| And so when we think about our personal preferences, that's what I do in my personal life, but as my responsibility for closet 60,000 kids and 3000 employees I have to think differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6406)|
| 1:46:59| And I have to take myself out of the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| Um, I think it's pretty clear where we stand and I honestly, the policy that is being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| I want to elevate the conversation a little bit more because it kind of feels like we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| here to prove points and I don't think that's productive at all and so I like to elevate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| the conversation and take us back to the policy which is presented and this policy will sunset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| in August 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| So, if we continue to push, like get the vaccine for people who want to and feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6442)|
| 1:47:29| from the way that we're seeing the projections of everything happening, I don't, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| an expert, I'm not CDC and I apologize to any of our experts that feel like their expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6454)|
| 1:47:41| has been discredited by people who have no information, um, or no studies or background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| in this type of stuff so, um, but I want to ask if this policy does sunset August 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6466)|
| 1:47:54| which it's, I don't, I personally don't have a problem with that if that's the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| of the board, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| What does it look like if come September there's an influx?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| What are those processes in place to say, hey, this is where we're moving to, to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| next phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| So, I feel like if we do adopt this policy and adopt these changes, it also needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| follow with the communication that follows and how quickly we'll be able to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| done and the systems in place to make that happen, um, to ensure that there's no confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| um, and that everybody is following that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| What else did I want to say, I've been waiting so long, um, so yeah, so if this is, if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6508)|
| 1:48:37| does go and move forward, right, and I, I, I appreciate your point, Board Member Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6517)|
| 1:48:44| regarding that we've chosen which CDC to follow, right, because the guideline was not to open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| but Superintendent Thomas' wisdom of how to get, like what the kids need, um, was precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| so I do, I do respect that, but I also want to keep, have us keep in mind that we're opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6538)|
| 1:49:05| schools and yeah, kids not really transmitting the, the virus, but without teachers and adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6545)|
| 1:49:14| you won't have school, and so I think it's important to really be mindful of the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| and their protection and their health, but given that this policy was set in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| they have time to get the vaccine if that is something that they're comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| Um, dang, can you come back to me if I remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| It was one more thing I should have wrote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| Yeah, we'll put that to you, that's totally fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Um, but no, that's just my take on all of it, but if we are to adopt this policy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| change, I appreciate the Board for putting, voting for this policy in August, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| we don't know what it will look like, um, what it could have looked like this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| and I'm just grateful, I'm not one of the 500,000 people that are dead and I'm able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| to have this conversation about what's going on, or the over 600 people here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| that are dead, so just count your blessings in that, in that remark, but I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| for us to have a conversation if we do adopt this, what do those policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| look like to ensure that the communication is effective and clear, to eliminate the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| and forth of like, well I'm taking my kids out, can I sign them up in virtual, like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| need clear understanding of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| I think that Ms. Babb was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| Yeah, and she made me think about this, when you're talking about your policy, and I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| this is one thing, I sort of have a problem with the, or this is where I'm seeing a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| with the policy, is talking about revisiting it every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| I don't want to go through this every month, and I mean, I don't, and um, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| what worries me too, I mean, we meet on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| When we look at like, what happened with, we look at the virus and we look like over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| the past year, I mean, December was really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| It could hit really bad, and we don't have a voting meeting to vote on it, so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| the way this policy is set up, I think it doesn't necessarily reflect being fluid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| the circumstances, and that is one reason I like the superintendent's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| more following what the medical professionals, I think the problem that a lot of people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| having is they don't like what the medical professionals are telling them, but I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| that because it can be more fluid of, they see something today, versus we're not fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| I mean, we meet once a month, and the situation might not come with a voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| Ms. Henderson, would you like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| Yes, that makes sense to me, because we do only meet if something happens mid-month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| and we need to switch it over, and maybe, Mr. Dupler, that's something, if this is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| that we can kind of, I don't know, kind of work on, or I can work with you this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| I'm not really sure how that works, but, and maybe it's kind of a thing like with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| Our schools are open right now, but then, you know, tomorrow they could be closed, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6720)|
| 1:52:06| know, based on numbers, and maybe it's kind of the same thing, where, okay, well, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| know, things are getting worse, kind of the same lines of, okay, well, tomorrow, school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| A needs to wear masks tomorrow, and maybe it's kind of done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| Okay, I just, well, and if there's, this policy wouldn't exist if it sunsets, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Is that correct, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| Do you want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Yeah, like this current policy would expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| So I think this goes to Mr. Thomas' point, which is, I mean, he came up with a reopening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6755)|
| 1:52:43| plan for this school year, 2021, 2020, 2021, it's hard to say sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6763)|
| 1:52:52| So he did that, and this board signed off on it, and then came up with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6772)|
| 1:53:00| So these things really need to go hand-in-hand going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| Now, Mr. Thomas' reopening plan will naturally sunset at the end of this year, because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| was designed for this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| So this office's recommendation to the board would be whether it's a procedure that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| put in the hands of Mr. Thomas and his team, or it's some type of a new plan that he comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6804)|
| 1:53:34| up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| I mean, that's, again, going to have to go part and parcel, because he's had the metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6815)|
| 1:53:41| in his plan and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| So you're still going to need that in some form or fashion to have any type of ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6823)|
| 1:53:51| to pivot or make any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| Like you're talking about, I mean, you know, unless you have a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| you only meet once a month, and you have Mr. Thomas as, you know, as somebody who can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6837)|
| 1:54:03| quicker decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| Okay, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| So this is interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| This is the time where this is one of those meetings where everybody in this room gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| branded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| I don't know if anybody else is feeling that, but because people attach so much to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| And so the comments that we're making, people in the public right now are making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| about our values, about a lot of things, because of masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| So I know I'm about to be branded, and I'm really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6871)|
| 1:54:38| So I had at least 157 emails before 3 o'clock today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| I read, I promise you, I read every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| Absolutely did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| I also made a spreadsheet of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| Here's what's really clear in that spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| There's doctors both sides on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| There's teachers both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| There's parents on both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Now except for this really nice handwritten note, I didn't have one student email me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| so I don't know what they were thinking in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| Here's another observation about that spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| Anybody who mentions it says, if you only follow the science, it doesn't matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| side of the issue you're on, if you only follow the science, you would do X, Y, and Z, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| So it doesn't matter what side of the issue you're on, everybody says, this has become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| too political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| That is the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| But everybody's saying it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| It's become too political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| For the board's sake, I asked our wonderful secretary to do an audit of how much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6931)|
| 1:55:36| we spend on this issue, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| So since November 4th, we've had six meetings on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| We've spent at least four and a half hours talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| That's not counting all the time we've individually spent on this issue, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| We've had 33 public forum speakers to date, and we have 20-something tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| So not counting the time that we're spending today on this issue, four and a half hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| my question as a public servant who is elected to help advance education for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| in Knox County is, what in the world else could I be spending my time on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| Now don't hear me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| If we want to have 20 more meetings about it, I will be there and I will read all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| emails and I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| If that's what the public is asking this body to invest its time in, I'm down with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| I'm elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| I hope that the public keeps the passion up for the real issues of this pandemic, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6984)|
| 1:56:33| is the impact on our students and the lost time in learning, which is the impact on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=6993)|
| 1:56:41| teachers and our administrators and our families and the real mental health issues of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| pandemic because they are real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| But it's not caused alone by masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| Mental health around this pandemic was not caused because somebody asked a kid to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| a mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| It may help it, and I'm not saying that myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| I've talked to mental health providers, even at East Tennessee Children's Hospital, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| they all say, yes, mental health is impacting everybody related to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| But it's because of the whole of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| It's not because mask by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| So that's my concern with this is we continue to spend all that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| The time that I outlaid was not about COVID mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| That's what we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| I also continue to hear that we need to have a choice in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| If you say that, and you're saying that because you feel like your kids shouldn't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| you have to acknowledge that in doing that and saying you want your kid in that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| you are not allowing the parent to have a choice who thinks their kids should be masked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| because it's a public health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| Because you're saying I'm going to put my kid next to yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| I get choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| I love choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| I rock choice out every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| But there's also times in my life where I put some of that choice beside because I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| trying to do something for somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| And we're used to that as a society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| My mother and other people in my family, they're avid smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| They can't smoke in restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| And the reason we've said that as a society is because we're going to not infringe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7092)|
| 1:58:18| choice on somebody else because of public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| That's why we've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| So also, everybody wants to get back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| I don't know anybody who wants to get back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| But to Ms. Satterfield's point, some people can't get back to normal because their loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| ones have died, because they've lost their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| And so this whole elevation of normal, we have to acknowledge normal is out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7118)|
| 1:58:44| Yes, we need to create new rhythms in our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| Yes, we need to continue to be healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| But whatever that thing was before the pandemic, we don't get to experience that in the exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| same way, or at least not everybody does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| Also, this pandemic has had a specific impact on our lower income and historically oppressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| And I will tell you, in that spreadsheet from everybody who told me a little bit about themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7145)|
| 1:59:12| no one was from a historically oppressed community that was communicating with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| And don't get me wrong, all I'm saying is I think historically oppressed communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| have felt this harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| And I want to make sure that as somebody who's not lived in a historically oppressed community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| that I'm acknowledging that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| And also, I hear a lot in those emails about loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| We have all felt loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| There's nobody I'm going to ask in this room tonight who said who is not going to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| they have not felt lost in this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| So don't pit me against your kid or somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| Because you say they've experienced loss and I don't understand it because we all understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| to a degree that people have experienced loss in this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| So yes, let's work on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| I'm totally down with figuring out the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| But we as a school board need to make sure that we're focusing our energy where it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| to be focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| And we have some choice in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| And again, I'm not saying we don't listen to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| But the reality is the constituents are not clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| So I would make a recommendation for the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| And I think it's to Evdy's point and Ms. Babb's point that if it's going to sunset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7227)|
| 2:00:34| I don't think we need to revisit every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| We've been doing that and nothing's been solved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| I don't know how keep visiting every month is going to help it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| If we make it sunset, we have to give some indication at what we're going to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| to decide whether or not we're going to ask people to wear a mask again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| I hope by August 1st, the people who are way smarter than me, that put way more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| in this, that we pay, that have gotten a lot of education, who are suggesting that we wear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| masks in schools, I'm hoping that guidance changes without a doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| But if it should reverse course or whatever, we need to have something that says, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| are we going to do with that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| And so my recommendation would be to say this policy will sunset on August 1st, 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| unless, and I think we have to choose an entity because to Mr. Dupler's point, when he and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| I were talking, these groups could diverge at some point, unless the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| of Health continues to list universal mask wearing for safe operations for K-12 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7293)|
| 2:01:40| And the reason I didn't go with the CDC is because, although I think that's ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| who we should go to, the reality is we're under the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| And so that would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| And then another recommendation for the policy, and this is on line 21, bullet point two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| because again, my 157 emails for anybody who's against the mask, the one issue that is consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7318)|
| 2:02:05| gets brought up is the effects of mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| I think this policy is actually fairly loose in the sense of there's a lot of discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| by principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| Are families taking advantage of that discretion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| I have no clue that people are asking for leniency, but there's a lot of ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| have leniency in this policy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| And I think that was wise from the board and I think it was intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| And I will also recall that the board voted for this policy eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| I wasn't on the board at the time, but the board at that time voted for this policy eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| So in bullet point two, I would say students, employees, and visitors may be exempted from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7358)|
| 2:02:45| this policy by the school principal due to a medical and or a mental health condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7365)|
| 2:02:52| related to mask as documented by a licensed medical or mental health professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7372)|
| 2:02:59| So this is line 21, bullet point two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| Number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| I was looking for bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| I guess it's not technically a bullet point, but it's number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| And I think part of that is because I'm trying to really listen to the, the massive folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| who have contacted me and what their concern is, what I keep hearing is my kid is suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| because of mass from a mental health standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| And I think we've all, we already in the policy allowed for medical condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| And I think we can be explicit about medical and mental health conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| I noticed nobody was cheering for me out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| Ms. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Yeah, I'm concerned about that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| I know that this, I mean, I read this and having worked in the schools, I know how hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| it would be for me as a parent to get a medical or a mental exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7435)|
| 2:04:02| And then you've got the IEPs mentioned and the 504 plans, and it's not as easy as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| sounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| And I also know that depending on your doctor, it may or may not be easy to get that medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7449)|
| 2:04:18| exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| I mean, I know how my granddaughter has been affected mentally and it may not show up as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| a true mental disability, but I mean, she hates going to school and she has the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| wonderful teacher in the world, but she hates going to school this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| She has trouble breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| She has trouble with the heat related to the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| But would a doctor write her a medical exemption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| But yet every afternoon I see the effects of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| So as a grandparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| So I can't be real supportive of that because I think it's too limiting and too hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| obtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| Ms. Pabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| Can you restate your thing about following the Tennessee, who was it you were asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7503)|
| 2:05:12| us to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| So earlier in the policy, this is line threes and four, we mentioned the Centers for Disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7513)|
| 2:05:20| and Control and Prevention, the Tennessee Department of Health, and the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| The reason I was suggesting picking one in terms of deciding if it sunsets is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7526)|
| 2:05:32| at some point those three groups could diverge in terms of their guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| And if we can, if we say we're going to sunset it because of, you know, the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7535)|
| 2:05:41| if we look at the recommendations of all three, well, what if two of them aren't in agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| And so my recommendation was this policy will sunset on August 1st, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| And less at that time, right, August 2021, first, the Tennessee Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| continued to list universal mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| I think that word universal is pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| I mean, everything I read about the guidance is it's, you know, the universal is a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| important word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| The universal mask wearing for safe operations of K-12 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| And then I would remove the part about the month to month looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7573)|
| 2:06:21| I guess this is the question I have, and I posed this question to Mr. Dupler and I posed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| it to Mr. Thomas, because I'm looking at, we've got Ms. Henderson's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| I guess I'm calling your policy a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| And then we've got the superintendent's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| And I don't think they job with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| Like I don't think we can, we can't pass both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| So that's where I sort of feel like we've kind of got, I mean, this is sort of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| I'm taking it as we've sort of got two suggestions going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| And as a board, we're going to have to decide between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| And I mean, Mr. Thomas's is not posed as a policy versus yours is posed as a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| But that's kind of the way I'm taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| And I don't know how others are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| But so sometimes I don't know if it is worth kind of changing yours or if it's just almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7623)|
| 2:07:11| how do we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| Is it sort of your recommendation or your recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| I've been a little confused about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| Well, I just had a question for Mr. Dupour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| I thought I heard you say that this would, this policy kind of automatically sunsets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7644)|
| 2:07:32| anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| We passed, maybe not, we passed it in the, at your recommendation at the time of an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7653)|
| 2:07:42| kind of to get us back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| But going forward, we really need to look at the superintendent developing a new plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7666)|
| 2:07:54| for 21-22 and possibly a new policy to go along and mesh with his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7674)|
| 2:08:03| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| Because if that's true, then we need to just let this one sunset out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7685)|
| 2:08:12| You can take off the part that Ms. Babb didn't like about month-to-month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| My purpose of having that in there was not to give us more flexibility, but to let the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7697)|
| 2:08:24| public know that just because we mask doesn't mean we're going to stay masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7704)|
| 2:08:29| So you better choose wisely when you make your choice of homeschool or virtual or in-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7709)|
| 2:08:36| So is that correct that he needs a new plan for 21-22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| We need to, our policy needs to reflect a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| Thank you, Madam Chair, thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7727)|
| 2:08:52| It's close, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7732)|
| 2:08:53| I mean, what I said was that Mr. Thomas' plan, because there's two different things going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7733)|
| 2:09:00| on right now, and they're in concert right now, but that may change, again, just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| the guidelines are changing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| So right now, this board has approved Mr. Thomas' plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| That plan will naturally sunset at the end of this school year, because it was always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| designed, if you look at that plan, it was always designed for this particular school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| year that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| But then when you look at this policy, this policy is in conjunction with the plan, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7768)|
| 2:09:34| separate from the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| So this policy does not naturally sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| I mean, if you look at other policies that this board has, you know, for instance, searches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7778)|
| 2:09:45| and seizures, I mean, there are policies that have sunset provisions in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7785)|
| 2:09:52| So in the law department's advice, I mean, this would not be a plan or a policy that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7792)|
| 2:10:01| going to naturally sunset without some type of action from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7801)|
| 2:10:06| But again, our recommendation is you have to look at both of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| You have to look at some type of plan going forward, and you've got to look at this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| And the board's already weighed in on both of these things for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| So now you're talking about next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| So given that all of this was designed for an emergency pandemic where we knew nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7827)|
| 2:10:36| about this disease, I'm not saying throw it out entirely, but to me, I would either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7836)|
| 2:10:45| rather let it sunset and come up with a policy that addressed the situation for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7845)|
| 2:10:51| versus trying to, I don't know, trying to make this policy and move it on forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7851)|
| 2:10:57| another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| Because I don't feel like this policy really reflects where we're at right now as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7858)|
| 2:11:05| as a school district, and as a society, and especially in light of what so many of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| know, that none of the school districts around us are doing what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7870)|
| 2:11:16| And most of them, I mean, Maryville's never had a mask mandate for their early childhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7876)|
| 2:11:23| kids or, you know, elementary age kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| So I just feel like that to go forward with this policy that was developed under very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7886)|
| 2:11:34| different circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| That's my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7896)|
| 2:11:37| If we want to take everything out except sunset it out, however we can make it work as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| but I think it really needs a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| And I hate to, yeah, I don't want to speak over anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| I just wanted to address what Ms. Bounds is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| It's really the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| I mean, the board can say, hey, we're done with this policy and come up with a completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7912)|
| 2:11:57| new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| The board can go forward with Ms. Henderson's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| I mean, it's just, it's whatever the board wants to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| Now I have lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| I know Ms. Christie was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7930)|
| 2:12:11| And then after that, I've kind of lost track because I forgot to pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| Were you next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| Were you next before her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| No, Christie was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| Christie, then Ebony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| And then I don't remember who, I don't know who it was between you two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| So Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| I'm going to keep it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| I'm going to be Pollyanna here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| I think things are going to be much better by the time we start the new school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| My personal preference is to not make a decision on masks in April for August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7951)|
| 2:12:43| You know, I think that, you know, the plan's going to have to be rewritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7963)|
| 2:12:49| It would be nice to see some metrics or something in there that is more geared toward how do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7969)|
| 2:12:55| we get back to normal rather than what's going to shut us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7975)|
| 2:13:00| Because I think that we need to include that for parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| I mean, I've been very transparent with the people that have reached out to me and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| just said, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| I do not know if your children will need masks in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| I mean, I'm hopeful and I'm optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| I don't think they will, but you know, I don't, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=7996)|
| 2:13:23| So I would, I would like to see it wait and maybe be brought back with whatever Bob does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8003)|
| 2:13:29| with his new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| And you know, one, one, one issue was when parents are deciding between virtual and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| person, it was kind of a bigger thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| If that's really kind of going away, that, that kind of plays into that because now there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8021)|
| 2:13:47| really not that choice, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| So my thinking at this point is that we, if we're going to do virtual off of virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8030)|
| 2:13:57| it's going to be with three schools, like we talked about elementary, middle, high and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8037)|
| 2:14:02| very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| You know, if we don't have more than 4,500, 1,500 at each school, then we're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| But if we have more than, you know, we, we can't move forward with more than 4,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| So some, some people won't get a choice at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| So that's what I'm thinking there, getting us off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| So it kind of does change for parents that wanted to know this piece of information for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| when they made that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| Things have changed just today with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| So okay, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| Christie, Christie, pretty much said what I was going to agree with Board Member Bowns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| that I, I support this policy sunset in August because it was for emergency reaction, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8078)|
| 2:14:46| And then letting, seeing Superintendent Thomas, oh, reopen and plan our idea and creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8086)|
| 2:14:53| a policy that matches that because we, we're going to, we don't need to be in friction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8093)|
| 2:14:58| with our superintendent, whatever that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| But I also just want to, you know, but you might not know, so I'm just going to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| We can't really compare Knox County schools to surrounding districts because Maryville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8105)|
| 2:15:10| City Schools is the, is the size of my district alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| And so we're a pretty big district and so are any private school, Loudon County, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| And so I think in Knoxville, we get used to our communities and never really realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8120)|
| 2:15:25| that there's communities way across town and we're Knox County schools as a whole and we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| we govern a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| So yeah, that's what I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| And we'll go to Mr. Watson and then to Ms. Henderson and then to Ms. Bowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| Just one last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| I really appreciate the last few minutes of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| I appreciate all of it, but I really appreciate the last few minutes of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| And I think, so I read the minutes and Ms. Satterfield, will you just confirm, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| what happened when this, when this policy was first approved was there was a plan presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| first and then, then following meeting, you presented a policy and according to the minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| the reason why you presented that is you wanted more clarity about implementation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8165)|
| 2:16:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| My guess is most people know what the expectation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| If we have masks or not, what the expectation is, if we do have them, I mean, what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| kind of know how this thing rolls, I'm, I'm actually, I think I'm good with saying, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| put this back in the hands of the superintendent, do away with the policy August 1st and let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| him do what he needs to do in terms of the plan, because to Mr. Dupler's point, we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| because of where we're in the pandemic, especially, and things are continuing to change all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| time, we need to be more nimble to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| So especially given the reason why the policy was enacted in the first place, it was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8203)|
| 2:16:48| clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| I think we're pretty clear on what the expectations would be if we had them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8211)|
| 2:16:55| I don't know that it needs to continue to be a board level policy and it can be, go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| back to more of a day-to-day operations management issue as a thought, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| And Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8225)|
| 2:17:06| Thank you, Madam Chair and Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| So I think a lot of good points have been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| I think this has been productive conversation right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| I do agree, maybe like sunsetting this policy because it was written and I appreciate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| policy so much as a parent, you know, going into a school year, I appreciate that we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8239)|
| 2:17:23| to go to school, sunsetting this current policy because it was during an emergency situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8243)|
| 2:17:31| and then maybe working on the part of the reopening plan about the face coverings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| if that sounds okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| And Ms. Pab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| And now maybe I'm confused because, well, I mean, what I'm trying to clarify is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| I feel like we've only been talking about this, but to me, the bigger issue is Mr. Thomas's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| recommendation and we keep talking about the reopening plan, but I feel like you have put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| out a recommendation for the reopening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| And so are we going to discuss that next or that's where I feel like, I feel like we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| concentrated all on this policy and the bigger issue is really his recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| And you said earlier that we're basically making a choice between, I mean, and I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| know, but I think you're, I think you've characterized it very well between that portion of the superintendent's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8291)|
| 2:18:18| plan and the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| Obviously the policy trumps the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| And if we, if we change this policy, if it's sunset, then as Mr. Thomas stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8303)|
| 2:18:29| that's what he would carry out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| So does that clear it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| Yeah, but I do think the bigger thing is, cause I think there's probably some disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| among this board on Mr. Thomas's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| And I feel like we, I didn't know if we were now going to that to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| That's where I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8327)|
| 2:18:48| Like if we were talking about the policy and now we're moving to his recommendation because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| I do, I do disagree a little bit with you on parents not needing to know, because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| have a lot of parents from what I'm hearing about, they want to know if they need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| private, they need to know if they're going, um, uh, and I'm forgetting all the terms and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| Some of these parents tell me if their child has to wear a mask, they will not be in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| County schools in person, or if it's the opposite, they will not be in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| And so I think you're right, can't just leave it totally ambiguous because it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8354)|
| 2:19:20| a virtual in person, it's a, do I go to, do I send my kids to Knox County schools next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| I think you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| And that's, that's really why I felt like we had to have this conversation now in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| Granted, it's early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| No, we all agree on that, but I think you're a hundred percent right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| I have gotten, you know, I've also gotten 150 emails and I've read most of them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| we've all gotten 150 emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| So I think that an overwhelming, um, theme of those was parents want the right to choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| and a lot of teachers, I've heard from a lot of teachers who parents and teachers want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| the right to choose whether they wear a mask and that it's, that our decision does play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| into whether they're going to homeschool or go to, I mean, I've heard people say they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| going to just move to a different County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| And we've had people that have moved here from California who can't believe we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| consider masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| So, you know, I think it is a, that's why I do think it's a big deal right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| So, um, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| And I had another point and it just went totally out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| We've got to give people some direction where we're thinking, and I don't, I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8417)|
| 2:20:24| we can say we all know August 15th, but I think it's got to be tied to something, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8424)|
| 2:20:31| it's his recommendation in the Knox County Health Department or a benchmark that his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| office comes up with or something, because parents have got to feel like they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| it's going to change or it's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| It's going to be one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| I feel like we, I guess my, my thought is that, you know, I'm in favor of this sun setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8443)|
| 2:20:50| on April 1st and, but at the same time providing, and the superintendent would have to certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8450)|
| 2:20:58| weigh in on, you know, if we got into a situation where, you know, we're seeing, we were back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8458)|
| 2:21:04| to like the December problem that we were having, you know, what would he do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| What would his, what would he want to do at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| So I think that we're, I think we're, I think we're kind of agreeing, it sounds like, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8473)|
| 2:21:22| we think this should sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| I mean, I'm not, we're not voting right now, obviously, but I think it sounds like there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| a lot of agreement around the table, which I'm glad to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| I think that's progress, that we've actually been able to talk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| I know it's been two hours, but we've come to some kind of understanding that this, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8494)|
| 2:21:41| know, and, and that this was an emergency policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| And I, the reason I supported the policy was because I voted for the reopening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| I felt like the reopening plan at the time, we thought, you know, we definitely need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| have masks so we can go back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| The reopening plan included masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| So therefore I voted for this because this was an emergency policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| Would I have voted for it if I thought it was going to be here forever or even into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| next school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8529)|
| 2:22:10| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| But it says emergency measure and therefore, you know, I felt like I could support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| So, so I appreciate that whoever brought that out, I think Ms. Satterfield and Ms. Bounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8537)|
| 2:22:22| that, that this, you know, that this was for an emergency reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| So I, it sounds like we have agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| We think maybe we should sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| It's just kind of what the next, the question is after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| Mr. Watson, do you have a brilliant idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| Well, I don't know if it's brilliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| You can tell me later, Mr. Thomas, I think there's, it sounds like where we're headed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8559)|
| 2:22:45| potentially is we're going to put something a lot, something pretty heavy on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| And so based on the conversation that we're having right now, it sounds like there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| I mean, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| I do think parents have to have some sense of where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| I mean, I mean, we, I think we owe that to the public to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8579)|
| 2:23:05| I know you already have a starting point because we have a plan for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| I'm assuming you wouldn't be starting from scratch and I'm sure you all thought a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| What's a reasonable amount of time that we could expect as a board to see not a reopening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| We're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| But to see a plan related to public, any public health measures that we might keep in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8599)|
| 2:23:25| in Knox County Schools that you would recommend that we keep in Knox County Schools, an official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8605)|
| 2:23:29| kind of document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8609)|
| 2:23:30| Here's my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| You know, I would like for, we have a very talented team, so I would like for an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8611)|
| 2:23:37| for our team to discuss that, talk about that, and then come back to you, to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8617)|
| 2:23:43| What do you think is reasonable in terms of amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| I'm not going to hold you to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| Let me, let me, today's Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| We meet again next Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| Let us shoot for a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| You know, here's the thing too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| We may not know about this virtual, the plan until late May, which, you know, it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| too late to, for parents to probably make a decision on what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| So though, and John's a lot more versed on, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8653)|
| 2:24:18| He's worked with the state board and also John, if I misspeak or say something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| if you please jump up and correct me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| So I think that's one issue that it could be much later in the school year before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| Another issue is if it's limited capacity, 4,500 students then, and we have 10,000, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| don't know what the number will be, that are interested in virtual, obviously a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| students are not going to get that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| So let me, let me, let me talk to staff tomorrow and then let me say, hey, here's what we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8682)|
| 2:24:49| is a reasonable time to, to be able to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| It sounds like, I mean, it sounds like from what the state board's intention is that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| going to have to jump to our plan for the following year, next year, basically, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| Going to having a small number of virtual schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| So basically we're just going to have to go there instead of the intermediary year that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8705)|
| 2:25:10| you were expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| I know both of you have your mics down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| I don't know who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| How many students do we have on virtual now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8717)|
| 2:25:18| I mean, I know we've thrown out numbers over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| About 12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8719)|
| 2:25:20| 13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8721)|
| 2:25:22| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8722)|
| 2:25:23| It is a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| If you're looking at 45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| Well, and, and I, you know, I'll bring this point up too, because it is a big number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| but I know I've heard from a lot of people and gotten a lot of emails that say that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=8726)|
