| 1005.5  | 1008.5  | do we as a city support this type of effort?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1005.5)             |

| 1015.5  | 1019.5  | would be a good way to go, then we might undertake that.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1015.5)             |

| 1030.5  | 1036.5  | So, in this case, they're looking specifically at, with a pilot,                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1030.5)             |

| 1061.5  | 1062.5  | Yes, absolutely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1061.5)             |
| 1062.5  | 1065.5  | I think the qualitative factors, and it's a little bit of a,                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1062.5)             |
| 1065.5  | 1070.5  | it's unusual wording, but they're getting at the things that can't be,                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1065.5)             |
| 1070.5  | 1072.5  | that's an I hate it when I make an obvious statement,                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1070.5)             |
| 1072.5  | 1074.5  | the things that can't be quantified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1072.5)             |
| 1074.5  | 1080.5  | And so, yes, we do part one internally as more of those qualitative factors                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1074.5)             |

| 1118.5  | 1119.5  | the workforce housing unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1118.5)             |
| 1119.5  | 1123.5  | So, there's 14 workforce housing units within this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1119.5)             |
| 1123.5  | 1124.5  | There's a few other items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1123.5)             |
| 1124.5  | 1129.5  | Obviously, that was a very underutilized piece of property near a transit line.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1124.5)             |
| 1129.5  | 1136.5  | So, there's a lot of those qualitative factors that we look at.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1129.5)             |
| 1136.5  | 1141.5  | I guess part of my concern with the analysis, and not necessarily this one,                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1136.5)             |
| 1141.5  | 1147.5  | but I believe this has come up in discussion before,                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1141.5)             |
| 1147.5  | 1152.5  | outside of the quantitative analysis that says the developer needs to make,                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1147.5)             |
| 1152.5  | 1156.5  | you know, 10% return rather than 7%,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1152.5)             |
| 1156.5  | 1164.5  | is just whether these projects would actually move forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1156.5)             |
| 1164.5  | 1169.5  | It might look a little bit differently,                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1164.5)             |
| 1169.5  | 1179.5  | but, you know, would we still see the redevelopment of this underutilized parcel                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1169.5)             |
| 1179.5  | 1184.5  | under this current market is what I'm questioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1179.5)             |
| 1184.5  | 1188.5  | Ms. Parker, there's some other people with lights on, so I'll go on.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1184.5)             |
| 1188.5  | 1191.5  | If you have an answer to that question, then I'll go on to the next question.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1188.5)             |
| 1191.5  | 1196.5  | I'll take a stab, and I'll lead with a terrible straddling of the fence here.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1191.5)             |
| 1196.5  | 1201.5  | We don't know, but we're very confident the 14 workforce housing units                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1196.5)             |
| 1201.5  | 1206.5  | would not be included otherwise, so we're certain there.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1201.5)             |
| 1206.5  | 1212.5  | In terms of the return, the return that they are 7.4%                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1206.5)             |
| 1212.5  | 1215.5  | is probably not going to get the project done,                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1212.5)             |
| 1215.5  | 1217.5  | but we don't know their capital needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1215.5)             |

| 1226.5  | 1229.5  | Okay, I have a question, and then I want to throw back out                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1226.5)             |
| 1229.5  | 1232.5  | and re-summarize what you just said, Mr. Bentley.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1229.5)             |
| 1232.5  | 1235.5  | So the project might move forward without the pilot,                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1232.5)             |
| 1235.5  | 1238.5  | but it might not include workforce housing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1235.5)             |
| 1238.5  | 1242.5  | That's correct, and I would say it definitely would not include the workforce housing.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1238.5)             |
| 1242.5  | 1247.5  | So that's the part that we negotiated, and that is what are the total number of units?                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1242.5)             |

| 1254.5  | 1258.5  | The other thing that's interesting in this is I see in here in the sheet                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1254.5)             |
| 1258.5  | 1261.5  | average monthly rent per live-work unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1258.5)             |
| 1261.5  | 1263.5  | Tell me what a live-work unit is,                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1261.5)             |
| 1263.5  | 1266.5  | because I don't think we've seen one specifically with that before.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1263.5)             |
| 1266.5  | 1270.5  | Right, so this is also part of what we are able to negotiate into this deal,                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1266.5)             |

| 1291.5  | 1294.5  | That's also incorporated into their residential space.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1291.5)             |

| 1326.5  | 1330.5  | Okay, and I just want to state out loud why that should be a hard no.                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1326.5)             |

| 1335.5  | 1340.5  | We've had other businesses in the community that have asked for bike lanes to be removed                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1335.5)             |
| 1340.5  | 1343.5  | so that they could have the parking,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1340.5)             |
| 1343.5  | 1347.5  | and the answer to them was no, no matter how much they begged and pleaded,                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1343.5)             |
| 1347.5  | 1351.5  | because people were using those bike lanes, and that's a commitment that we have as a city.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1347.5)             |

| 1368.5  | 1373.5  | because I think it helps round out the conversation for why we would accept this pilot.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1368.5)             |
| 1373.5  | 1377.5  | I think there is it fair to say in the past there was a qualitative narrative                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1373.5)             |
| 1377.5  | 1381.5  | that we didn't have specific 13 redevelopment priorities,                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1377.5)             |
| 1381.5  | 1389.5  | so Municap would have taken a look and given their best argument or four against why we need this.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1381.5)             |
| 1389.5  | 1396.5  | And over the past few months, I guess more than a year, we've established 13 priorities for redevelopment,                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1389.5)             |

| 1552.5  | 1563.5  | But the other items I worry if really this were strictly how we were applying or making the analysis,                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1552.5)             |
| 1563.5  | 1566.5  | a lot of developments would fit into this category.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1563.5)             |
| 1566.5  | 1574.5  | Just essentially anyone who commits to a development, if it's a mixed-use development,                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1566.5)             |
| 1574.5  | 1579.5  | if it's located in a walkable area, it sounds like they're going to get a tax incentive,                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1574.5)             |
| 1579.5  | 1582.5  | whether it's really needed or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1579.5)             |
| 1582.5  | 1590.5  | And so I will just keep emphasizing that we have to see workforce housing included as a part of these projects.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1582.5)             |
| 1590.5  | 1596.5  | And I wanted to ask also about parking and the rationale for the 40 spaces,                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1590.5)             |
| 1596.5  | 1601.5  | especially hearing more detail about the live-work spaces                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1596.5)             |
| 1601.5  | 1609.5  | and that there is anticipation that those spaces will entertain folks from the public.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1601.5)             |
| 1609.5  | 1612.5  | There are 40 per zoning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1609.5)             |
| 1612.5  | 1615.5  | Parking is not required for this development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1612.5)             |
| 1615.5  | 1623.5  | So we do see it as a positive that there are 40 spaces included on the private parcel.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1615.5)             |
| 1623.5  | 1626.5  | But it's also, as Councilwoman Ryder pointed out,                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1623.5)             |
| 1626.5  | 1632.5  | important for us to integrate this development into the streetscape with transportation corridors, sidewalks,                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1626.5)             |
| 1632.5  | 1634.5  | bike lanes, and parallel parking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1632.5)             |
| 1634.5  | 1639.5  | But we have an agreement with TDOT under the bridge where we have public parking,                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1634.5)             |
| 1639.5  | 1644.5  | and we're looking into extending the ingress and egress of that parking lot                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1639.5)             |
| 1644.5  | 1650.5  | so shared parking can be utilized for the whole area to support not only the local businesses,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1644.5)             |
| 1650.5  | 1653.5  | but the businesses in this development as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1650.5)             |

| 1657.5  | 1665.5  | Council, I just wanted to add that as someone who's lived and walked and biked in this immediate vicinity for over 20 years now,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1657.5)             |
| 1665.5  | 1671.5  | and it's been not a heavily utilized space, not a very active space,                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1665.5)             |
| 1671.5  | 1674.5  | I'm really excited about this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1671.5)             |
| 1674.5  | 1676.5  | It's a redevelopment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1674.5)             |
| 1676.5  | 1684.5  | It's going to activate a part of the neighborhood that, you know, hasn't seen much activation in over 20 years.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1676.5)             |

| 2057.46 | 2059.46 | I was just curious on that $300,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2057.46)            |
| 2059.46 | 2065.46 | Is that strictly for salary over two years or are there other allocations for those dollars?                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2059.46)            |
| 2065.46 | 2073.46 | That $300,000 is just for salaries for an employee that we would hire.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2065.46)            |

| 2854.46 | 2860.46 | And yes, I think, Council, you've actually had a workshop on this, if you recall, back in June of 2021.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2854.46)            |
| 2860.46 | 2865.46 | And the action step that the City staff recommended at that time in partnership with McNabb,                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2860.46)            |
| 2865.46 | 2869.46 | who of course is the core staff support for our co-responder program,                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2865.46)            |
| 2869.46 | 2874.46 | was to fund and complete the sequential intercept mapping process,                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2869.46)            |
| 2874.46 | 2879.46 | which informs where there are gaps in the existing system and what resources exist.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2874.46)            |
| 2879.46 | 2882.46 | And so that process was completed last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2879.46)            |
| 2882.46 | 2888.46 | And alternative response, while it was considered one of the considerations of that workshop very specifically,                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2882.46)            |
| 2888.46 | 2891.46 | it did not emerge as one of the top recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2888.46)            |
| 2891.46 | 2898.46 | In light of that, as well as some of the ongoing priorities that we have related to standing up the new violence interruption program                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2891.46)            |
| 2898.46 | 2904.46 | and knowing funding constraints as well, this budget does not include funding for alternative response,                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2898.46)            |
| 2904.46 | 2908.46 | but it does include the continued funding for, of course, community safety initiatives,                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2904.46)            |
| 2908.46 | 2914.46 | including Turnip Knocks and, you know, continued discussion and the ability to continue to explore the types of programs                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2908.46)            |
| 2914.46 | 2924.46 | that can not only serve the community, but also help the police department focus on core law enforcement actions that they need to prioritize.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2914.46)            |
| 2924.46 | 2930.46 | Thank you. Council Member Parker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2924.46)            |
| 2930.46 | 2933.46 | Thank you, Mayor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2930.46)            |
| 2934.46 | 2942.46 | I have a question, but I'm also needing to respond to what was just shared.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2934.46)            |
| 2942.46 | 2953.46 | And I'm not prepared enough to respond to it, but I remember that conversation about the sequential intercept mapping.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2942.46)            |
| 2953.46 | 2969.46 | And essentially that's, you know, how to ensure those in our community struggling with mental health are not coming into contact                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2953.46)            |
| 2969.46 | 2973.46 | with the justice system unnecessarily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2969.46)            |
| 2973.46 | 2982.46 | And so I remember at the time arguing that the best way to ensure that is an alternative response model that doesn't use police in the response.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2973.46)            |
| 2982.46 | 2995.46 | So I'm still confused, and I would love to get the city's report or analysis that came out of that sequential intercept mapping process,                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2982.46)            |
| 2995.46 | 3005.46 | because how it does not lead us to alternative response when the point of it is supposed to be to keep folks with mental health challenges                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2995.46)            |
| 3005.46 | 3013.46 | out of the criminal justice system when there is no need, you know, when they have not committed a criminal act, but are simply,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3005.46)            |
| 3013.46 | 3018.46 | we're just relying on a criminal justice system because we don't have other tools.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3013.46)            |
| 3018.46 | 3033.46 | So I continue to support alternative response, and I hope that we as a city will actually do our due diligence around this                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3018.46)            |
| 3033.46 | 3042.46 | and put some thoughtful consideration into what this could do for our city, because I think it's desperately needed.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3033.46)            |
| 3042.46 | 3058.46 | In terms of the budget, one question I had was looking at the, looking through it, you know, I compare it to older budgets because that's what helps me see things.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3042.46)            |
| 3059.46 | 3067.46 | I did not see reserves budgeted in here, so I wanted to ask where do we find our reserves in this budget?                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3059.46)            |
| 3067.46 | 3068.46 | Mr. Evans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3067.46)            |
| 3068.46 | 3078.46 | The proposed budget is a balanced budget, and there is no unassigned fund balance that needs to be appropriated for it.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3068.46)            |
| 3078.46 | 3080.46 | That's why you don't see any mention of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3078.46)            |
| 3084.46 | 3086.46 | Wait, what? There's no unassigned fund balance?                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3084.46)            |
| 3087.46 | 3095.46 | No, we have not, we are not proposing the appropriation of any unassigned fund balance dollars.                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3087.46)            |
| 3095.46 | 3096.46 | For reserves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3095.46)            |
| 3096.46 | 3102.46 | In other words, we're not dipping into our reserves, we're not dipping into our reserves to cover our operating budget for capital.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3096.46)            |
| 3103.46 | 3117.46 | But to budget a certain percentage of our budget to serve as our reserves and to have a balanced budget, would it not need to show up in the budget?                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3103.46)            |
| 3117.46 | 3120.46 | Or are we not budgeting for reserves?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3117.46)            |
| 3120.46 | 3131.46 | I'm thinking you may be thinking of the annual comprehensive financial report where we do lay out fund balance, the five different categories and what's in them.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3120.46)            |
| 3131.46 | 3145.46 | What we do in this, I mean what we do in the proposed budget is we talk about the sources of revenue in full and the expenditures that are going to be made and are being proposed in full.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3131.46)            |
| 3145.46 | 3147.46 | Those have to balance out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3145.46)            |
| 3147.46 | 3162.46 | So let me ask this, so our reserves are simply sitting in our unassigned fund balance and we don't include that like a 1.5% of our expenditures by policy?                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3147.46)            |
| 3162.46 | 3173.46 | We are required by charter to set back between 1 and 5% of the general fund as a reserve.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3162.46)            |
| 3173.46 | 3182.46 | That was something put in many, many years ago and we always put 1% aside in the budget for that.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3173.46)            |
| 3182.46 | 3188.46 | But that is, it's there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3182.46)            |
| 3188.46 | 3191.46 | And unassigned?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3188.46)            |
| 3191.46 | 3194.46 | Actually that would be committed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3191.46)            |
| 3194.46 | 3206.46 | That would be in a category called committed because the legislative body at one time approved of that so it would have to be in what's called committed fund balance.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3194.46)            |
| 3206.46 | 3212.46 | So either it's in unassigned fund balance or it should show up here for us to be able to submit that money.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3206.46)            |
| 3212.46 | 3215.46 | Actually there's five categories of unassigned fund balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3212.46)            |
| 3215.46 | 3219.46 | You've got non-spendable, okay, which you can't touch.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3215.46)            |
| 3219.46 | 3225.46 | You've got restricted, which somebody's put restriction on you by a grantor or something.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3219.46)            |
| 3225.46 | 3229.46 | You've got committed, which means it's gone before this legislative body.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3225.46)            |
| 3229.46 | 3233.46 | At some point you put some rules in place so that that goes into there.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3229.46)            |
| 3233.46 | 3242.46 | For instance, not only that 1% but 20% of the general fund goes into what's called a stabilization account.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3233.46)            |
| 3242.46 | 3247.46 | That's in committed fund balance because that was approved by the legislative body.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3242.46)            |
| 3247.46 | 3252.46 | Then you have what's called assigned, which are by practices put into that category.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3247.46)            |
| 3252.46 | 3258.46 | And then you have unassigned fund balance, which essentially it's available for use.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3252.46)            |
| 3258.46 | 3270.46 | Now, when we are projecting right now ending this FY that we're currently in at right around $29 million in unassigned fund balance.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3258.46)            |
| 3270.46 | 3275.46 | We're not having to use any of it in this budget that's proposed before you.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3270.46)            |
| 3275.46 | 3278.46 | Ms. Parker, your five minutes are up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3275.46)            |
| 3278.46 | 3280.46 | You can come back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3278.46)            |
| 3280.46 | 3282.46 | Go to your other council members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3280.46)            |
| 3282.46 | 3289.46 | It's just to clarify because I really want this to not just be for me but for the public to better understand our processes, right?                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3282.46)            |
| 3289.46 | 3296.46 | So if we have a policy that says we need to budget 1%, put aside 1% of our budget,                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3289.46)            |
| 3296.46 | 3301.46 | I want to be able we can identify that and clarify that it's not in our budget,                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3296.46)            |
| 3301.46 | 3307.46 | but it's in our funds under our assigned fund balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3301.46)            |
| 3307.46 | 3310.46 | But can we just clarify that, please?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3307.46)            |
| 3310.46 | 3313.46 | I think Mr. Evans just did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3310.46)            |
| 3313.46 | 3318.46 | So we'll go to Mr. Smith, and if there's further clarity that he can provide, we will do so.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3313.46)            |

| 3320.46 | 3324.46 | I had a lot of the same questions today, so I spent a half an hour trying to get clear on it.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3320.46)            |
| 3324.46 | 3326.46 | I think I'm there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3324.46)            |
| 3326.46 | 3331.46 | The second part of this ordinance is providing the authority to reappropriate non-project-related                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3326.46)            |
| 3331.46 | 3335.46 | encumbrances at the end of this FY into the next FY.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3331.46)            |
| 3335.46 | 3340.46 | That is correct, and that's a new part of this.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3335.46)            |
| 3340.46 | 3348.46 | That is something we've started doing the last proposed budget for the fiscal of the year that we're in now, FY23,                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3340.46)            |
| 3348.46 | 3353.46 | and it's in this proposed budget for the upcoming FY24.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3348.46)            |
| 3353.46 | 3358.46 | If you put that language in there, it's in the back of the, not the back of,                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3353.46)            |
| 3358.46 | 3364.46 | but it's after the numbers in the ordinance that you've got, the proposed budget ordinance,                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3358.46)            |
| 3364.46 | 3375.46 | which basically gives us the authority to move monies around at the end of the fiscal year                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3364.46)            |
| 3375.46 | 3377.46 | to balance out the various funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3375.46)            |
| 3377.46 | 3384.46 | For instance, if we fell short in, I don't know, special events, that office could very well happen,                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3377.46)            |
| 3384.46 | 3391.46 | but we had some extra in, I'll say Tom, their engineering department, not in the capital stuff,                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3384.46)            |
| 3391.46 | 3397.46 | but in their operating, maybe we could move it over there, because you've got to balance your budget for state law.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3391.46)            |
| 3397.46 | 3405.46 | One thing about the departments and funds, I can tell you almost anything you want to know,                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3397.46)            |
| 3405.46 | 3410.46 | but one thing I can tell you for sure is none of them are going to be exactly where you thought they were                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3405.46)            |
| 3410.46 | 3413.46 | at the time you set forth the proposed budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3410.46)            |
| 3413.46 | 3415.46 | You're going to be over on some.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3413.46)            |
| 3415.46 | 3417.46 | You're going to have less on some others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3415.46)            |
| 3417.46 | 3424.46 | So you've got to balance that, and that part of this ordinance, I think it's paragraph 6, I think it is,                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3417.46)            |
| 3424.46 | 3426.46 | gives us that authority, sir.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3424.46)            |
| 3426.46 | 3433.46 | And so if we have surplus in revenues, well, let me back, just to replay that back to you.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3426.46)            |
| 3434.46 | 3440.46 | At the end of this FY, between now and the end of the year, this is granting you authority to level load all of those                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3434.46)            |
| 3440.46 | 3444.46 | to reflect all the departmental budgets the way they originally budgeted.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3440.46)            |
| 3444.46 | 3445.46 | Is that fair?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3444.46)            |
| 3445.46 | 3446.46 | Affirmative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3445.46)            |
| 3446.46 | 3447.46 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3446.46)            |
| 3447.46 | 3451.46 | And now I've forgotten my second question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3447.46)            |
| 3451.46 | 3456.46 | I think you were talking about what's going to happen if, let's say there's excess revenues over expenditures.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3451.46)            |
| 3456.46 | 3458.46 | Yeah, it rains $5 million more than we expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3456.46)            |
| 3458.46 | 3461.46 | Then those automatically go into fund balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3458.46)            |
| 3461.46 | 3462.46 | Unassigned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3461.46)            |
| 3462.46 | 3465.46 | Unassigned fund balance as it pertains to the general fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3462.46)            |
| 3465.46 | 3469.46 | And we can only tap into those dollars if this body approves an alleged amendment.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3465.46)            |
| 3469.46 | 3470.46 | That's correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3469.46)            |
| 3470.46 | 3471.46 | We can't just spend them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3470.46)            |
| 3471.46 | 3472.46 | That's right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3471.46)            |
| 3472.46 | 3473.46 | We have to come back to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3472.46)            |
| 3473.46 | 3475.46 | So revenues are more than we projected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3473.46)            |
| 3475.46 | 3477.46 | That goes into our savings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3475.46)            |
| 3477.46 | 3480.46 | And if we want to use those, this body will approve them.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3477.46)            |
| 3480.46 | 3481.46 | Affirmative, yes, sir.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3480.46)            |

| 3482.46 | 3483.46 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3482.46)            |
| 3483.46 | 3484.46 | I had one more question about the alternative response.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3483.46)            |
| 3484.46 | 3488.46 | I do think, you know, I would like to discuss that more in our legislative meeting.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3484.46)            |
| 3489.46 | 3497.46 | So I echo Councilman Parker's comments around data, specifically as it relates to the co-responder model to date.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3489.46)            |
| 3497.46 | 3506.46 | I remember, or at least maybe I read myself into the play, but I remember us discussing all the options, voting to proceed with this option,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3497.46)            |
| 3507.46 | 3519.46 | but leaving the door open for the ability to be nimble and pivot more in a non-co-responder, alternative response only model.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3507.46)            |
| 3519.46 | 3523.46 | So that data, I think, would be very welcome to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3519.46)            |
| 3523.46 | 3531.46 | Not to belabor the point now, but turn up knocks does violence interruption now.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3523.46)            |
| 3532.46 | 3537.46 | Did they respond without a police officer?                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3532.46)            |
| 3537.46 | 3541.46 | Turn up knocks does not respond to 911 calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3537.46)            |
| 3541.46 | 3543.46 | Ms. Middlebrook?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3541.46)            |
| 3543.46 | 3549.46 | Violence interruption and alternative response are two different models, and so when they engage, they are not engaging with police officers,                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3543.46)            |
| 3549.46 | 3551.46 | but it is not the same thing as alternative response.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3549.46)            |
| 3551.46 | 3553.46 | It's designed to do some very different things.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3551.46)            |
| 3553.46 | 3557.46 | Two different things, but turn up knocks does respond without police officers.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3553.46)            |
| 3557.46 | 3558.46 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3557.46)            |
| 3558.46 | 3559.46 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3558.46)            |
| 3559.46 | 3560.46 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3559.46)            |
| 3560.46 | 3567.46 | I would just add that turn up knocks did not exist a few years ago, and the city, and Ms. Middlebrook in particular,                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3560.46)            |
| 3567.46 | 3576.46 | has helped them establish themselves and create a nonprofit from scratch, and SEED has been really helpful in that,                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3567.46)            |
| 3576.46 | 3581.46 | and that just takes a tremendous amount of work and capacity building.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3576.46)            |
| 3581.46 | 3586.46 | So it's not that you can just flip a switch and say, let's do this.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3581.46)            |
| 3586.46 | 3588.46 | It takes a lot of training because we want to do it right.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3586.46)            |
| 3588.46 | 3596.46 | And similar with alternative response, to my knowledge, there is no existing entity in the city of Knoxville                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3588.46)            |
| 3596.46 | 3603.46 | or in the nearby area who is ready, willing, and able to do the work similar to what we've heard about in other cities.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3596.46)            |
| 3603.46 | 3610.46 | So standing that up is something that could conceivably be done, but it's not easy,                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3603.46)            |
| 3610.46 | 3615.46 | and it's not something that we've prioritized the violence interruption has been a higher priority.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3610.46)            |
| 3615.46 | 3616.46 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3615.46)            |
| 3616.46 | 3621.46 | I'll just end by saying I think they're both similar in the sense that we're trying something new,                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3616.46)            |
| 3621.46 | 3627.46 | and we need just my opinion is that we need to remain nimble enough to adapt to what we learn from the data                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3621.46)            |
| 3627.46 | 3630.46 | and not feel restricted to whatever that is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3627.46)            |
| 3630.46 | 3637.46 | The same way we weren't restricted to what we did before, we should remain nimble and use data to change.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3630.46)            |

| 3642.46 | 3649.46 | Director Evans, since we're talking with you right now, just obviously we're going to,                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3642.46)            |
| 3649.46 | 3654.46 | council's going to have our legislative budget hearings on May 9th, so we'll get into more detail here.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3649.46)            |
| 3654.46 | 3662.46 | But just in general, how would you characterize the financial health of the city in this budget?                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3654.46)            |
| 3662.46 | 3666.46 | Just off the top of my head, I'd have to say financially sound.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3662.46)            |
| 3666.46 | 3670.46 | By that I mean, yes, we're dealing with higher inflationary costs,                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3666.46)            |
| 3670.46 | 3673.46 | but we've got sufficient unassigned fund balance                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3670.46)            |
| 3673.46 | 3678.46 | and a total fund balance to deal with any unforeseen circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3673.46)            |
| 3678.46 | 3685.46 | And we didn't have to use any unassigned fund balance to propose a balanced budget.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3678.46)            |
| 3685.46 | 3691.46 | So, no, we don't have money falling all over the place, but we're in a financially sound position.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3685.46)            |

| 3696.46 | 3702.46 | can you talk to us a little bit about maybe like broad strokes about forecasting, projections,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3696.46)            |

| 3704.46 | 3709.46 | maybe in particular with trends you're seeing from the revenue side, things like that.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3704.46)            |

| 3721.46 | 3723.46 | One of them is inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3721.46)            |

| 3735.46 | 3741.46 | We also looked at the increase in pension unfunded liability that we have to pay,                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3735.46)            |

| 3752.46 | 3755.46 | and if you look at our capital, proposed capital budget,                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3752.46)            |
| 3755.46 | 3760.46 | you'll see that it's less by about that exact amount because we don't have that.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3755.46)            |

| 3773.46 | 3777.46 | and we've got increased sales tax revenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3773.46)            |
| 3777.46 | 3783.46 | I had written down here right around 16.4 million more projected                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3777.46)            |
| 3783.46 | 3787.46 | if you combine local option and state shared sales tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3783.46)            |
| 3787.46 | 3793.46 | If you go from this current FY into what we're thinking it's going to be in the proposed budget for 24.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3787.46)            |
| 3793.46 | 3800.46 | So those were the key things that we had to forecast.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3793.46)            |
| 3800.46 | 3801.46 | We forecast everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3800.46)            |
| 3801.46 | 3802.46 | You do a budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3801.46)            |
| 3802.46 | 3805.46 | Those were primary drivers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3802.46)            |

| 3806.46 | 3811.46 | And you have, and you mentioned this I think in some answers to some earlier questions,                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3806.46)            |
| 3811.46 | 3815.46 | but with regard to the economic stabilization fund,                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3811.46)            |
| 3815.46 | 3821.46 | you've got that funded with the 20% that goes in, you know, by council resolution,                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3815.46)            |

| 3923.46 | 3928.46 | So we can take a more closer look at that versus alternative response,                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3923.46)            |
| 3928.46 | 3935.46 | knowing that, as Council Member Smith and Parker alluded,                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3928.46)            |
| 3935.46 | 3941.46 | understanding that we should keep all options open as we look at mental health crisis,                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3935.46)            |
| 3941.46 | 3947.46 | those types of things that are increasing and the types of calls that we're receiving.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3941.46)            |
| 3947.46 | 3950.46 | And so I think that would be good for council members to have that information                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3947.46)            |
| 3950.46 | 3953.46 | kind of level set in the conversations going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3950.46)            |
| 3953.46 | 3955.46 | Yeah, I think that's a good idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3953.46)            |
| 3955.46 | 3959.46 | I'll work with Chief Noel to see how fast we can gather that information for you.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3955.46)            |
| 3959.46 | 3963.46 | I think it's also important, as you all know, since you've been working on mental health issues,                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3959.46)            |
| 3963.46 | 3966.46 | like the city can't do this alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3963.46)            |
| 3966.46 | 3969.46 | We need to work with our county and state officials,                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3966.46)            |
| 3969.46 | 3974.46 | since it's actually under their purview to provide for the public health, including mental health.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3969.46)            |
| 3974.46 | 3979.46 | We shouldn't let them off the hook of that obligation.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3974.46)            |

| 3985.46 | 3986.46 | One more thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3985.46)            |
| 3986.46 | 3992.46 | I'd also like to know if we can get the number of calls where police have had to accompany                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3986.46)            |
| 3992.46 | 3998.46 | mobile crisis unit on calls, if that's available, versus the co-responder unit.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3992.46)            |
| 3998.46 | 4002.46 | Yeah, I think the mobile crisis unit is a little bit of a misnomer.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3998.46)            |
| 4002.46 | 4003.46 | Is it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4002.46)            |
| 4003.46 | 4005.46 | I don't know.

| 4005.46 | 4012.46 | My understanding is they don't go with police barely at all, and it's not really instant like a 911 call.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4005.46)            |

| 4029.46 | 4033.46 | As you know, I'm a big supporter of the alternative response team.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4029.46)            |
| 4033.46 | 4038.46 | What I am curious about is this question is for Ms. LaKenya and Chief Noel.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4033.46)            |
| 4038.46 | 4046.46 | You guys were on a panel, and from what Ms. Connolly said, you were both very much in support of a model like this.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4038.46)            |
| 4046.46 | 4052.46 | Can you just comment on what you think might be a good way for us to move forward?                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4046.46)            |

| 4057.46 | 4064.46 | Yes, and I did participate in that panel, and I believe what I said on that panel is that I am open to exploring                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4057.46)            |
| 4064.46 | 4069.46 | how we may be able to engage something like alternative response in the future.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4064.46)            |
| 4069.46 | 4071.46 | I do see value in the work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4069.46)            |
| 4071.46 | 4075.46 | I also recognize that we have limited capacity in our city.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4071.46)            |
| 4075.46 | 4082.46 | And as we look at models, a lot of times and part of, I think, where some of the delay has come from,                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4075.46)            |
| 4082.46 | 4089.46 | and these are conversations that we have had with HEART, is there was some misunderstanding on each end,                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4082.46)            |
| 4089.46 | 4093.46 | I believe, as to how the work was going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4089.46)            |
| 4093.46 | 4098.46 | I thought that we had come to some more understanding about that, and we're looking to move forward,                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4093.46)            |
| 4098.46 | 4105.46 | and I'm eager to continue those conversations about how we can potentially move forward                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4098.46)            |
| 4105.46 | 4110.46 | in engaging similar work as we explore what our options are.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4105.46)            |
| 4110.46 | 4116.46 | At this point, we have, as Mayor Fincannon said, prioritized violence reduction,                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4110.46)            |
| 4116.46 | 4122.46 | as we have seen significant increases in violence in our community and have put our resources there.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4116.46)            |
| 4122.46 | 4128.46 | And, as Ms. Gill stated, in the participation in the sequential intercept mapping process                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4122.46)            |

| 4134.46 | 4141.46 | there was a lot of interest expressed in continuing to explore how to build out                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4134.46)            |
| 4141.46 | 4145.46 | and better resource the co-responder model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4141.46)            |
| 4145.46 | 4152.46 | And so we have been listening to service providers in the community around how to better engage.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4145.46)            |
| 4152.46 | 4156.46 | But I am, as everyone here has said, open to exploring all options                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4152.46)            |
| 4156.46 | 4162.46 | and keeping all options on the table as we look at how to best serve our community.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4156.46)            |

| 4164.46 | 4169.46 | I think this isn't an exact overlap with violence prevention.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4164.46)            |

| 4172.46 | 4178.46 | and as we've been using the police as social workers to make house calls,                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4172.46)            |
| 4178.46 | 4181.46 | I think it would actually help the police department for us to have that.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4178.46)            |
| 4181.46 | 4185.46 | But, Chief Noel, I'd love to hear your opinions on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4181.46)            |
| 4185.46 | 4191.46 | Well, as I said in the panel, I really think working with the violence interrupters                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4185.46)            |
| 4191.46 | 4194.46 | and turn up knocks has been very beneficial to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4191.46)            |
| 4194.46 | 4196.46 | I believe in the co-responder program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4194.46)            |
| 4196.46 | 4198.46 | I'm absolutely committed to that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4196.46)            |
| 4198.46 | 4200.46 | I'm committed to programs like law enforcement diversion.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4198.46)            |
| 4200.46 | 4209.46 | The other side of things, just the reality of it is that police and fire respond to a very high volume of calls to service.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4200.46)            |
| 4209.46 | 4214.46 | And any model that comes out of that is going to require a lot of staffing.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4209.46)            |
| 4214.46 | 4216.46 | So I'm not just like Director Middlebrook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4214.46)            |
| 4216.46 | 4217.46 | I'm not opposed to anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4216.46)            |

| 4219.46 | 4225.46 | But the reality of it is that we do respond to a high volume of calls, not only police but fire department as well.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4219.46)            |

| 4234.46 | 4238.46 | Hi. I know we talked about this a couple years ago, but please refresh my memory.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4234.46)            |
| 4238.46 | 4246.46 | The models that you looked at, were those models run by the police departments, the city, or non-profits that were separate entities?                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4238.46)            |
| 4246.46 | 4248.46 | They're some of everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4246.46)            |
| 4248.46 | 4258.46 | And what we would be looking to do is engage with the city, because as Chief Noel is alluding to, in most models, the calls run through 911.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4248.46)            |
| 4258.46 | 4259.46 | So the city has to be involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4258.46)            |
| 4259.46 | 4263.46 | This is not something that can be done outside the structure of the city.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4259.46)            |
| 4263.46 | 4266.46 | So it has to involve the partnership with the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4263.46)            |
| 4266.46 | 4276.46 | So we would welcome that opportunity, and we feel like we've not been as well received as we would like, but we look forward to working in partnership.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4266.46)            |
| 4276.46 | 4282.46 | Have you had a chance to have a conversation with Knox County, because 911 covers both?                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4276.46)            |
| 4282.46 | 4288.46 | We talked to fire department. Is that both Knox County andâ€”no, it's just the city.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4282.46)            |
| 4288.46 | 4290.46 | We've talkedâ€”no.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4288.46)            |
| 4290.46 | 4293.46 | So that's something that we should probably do.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4290.46)            |

| 4295.46 | 4297.46 | Thank you for that information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4295.46)            |

| 4299.46 | 4304.46 | I just jumped on the bandwagon of this, because we don't have this conversation often enough.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4299.46)            |

| 4312.46 | 4320.46 | I also had concerns about Section 6, which Councilmember Smith brought up and wanted to ask.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4312.46)            |
| 4320.46 | 4322.46 | You know, the public is very interested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4320.46)            |
| 4322.46 | 4340.46 | We are very interested in our budgeting process and how we, through this process as city council people, can review the budget and, as allowed by charter, make potential changes.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4322.46)            |
| 4340.46 | 4352.46 | And the way I read Section 6, it seems like it would be possible for us to amend the budget,                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4340.46)            |
| 4352.46 | 4363.46 | but then this would give the administration authority to essentially move that funding back to where, you know,                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4352.46)            |
| 4363.46 | 4370.46 | the administration wants that funding to be after not spending the funding for a certain amount of time.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4363.46)            |
| 4370.46 | 4376.46 | Could anyone speak to whether this passage, Section 6, would allow that?                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4370.46)            |
| 4376.46 | 4378.46 | I'm not sure I understand your question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4376.46)            |
| 4378.46 | 4379.46 | Can you ask it again, please?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4378.46)            |
| 4379.46 | 4393.46 | If we amended the budget and, say, moved, you know, $50,000 from animal control to stormwater,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4379.46)            |
| 4394.46 | 4414.46 | would this language on page 359 under Section 6 allow the administration to, you know, not spend that $50,000 and then move it back to the previous fund?                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4394.46)            |
| 4414.46 | 4420.46 | I don't know if Mr. Swanson can correct me if he thinks I'm incorrect here, but I don't think so,                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4414.46)            |
| 4420.46 | 4430.46 | because it has the statement in there within their respective funds, and stormwater is a special revenue fund.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4420.46)            |
| 4430.46 | 4437.46 | So, in other words, you can move funds around like within the general fund, but you can't get into special revenue funds.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4430.46)            |
| 4437.46 | 4439.46 | So not on that example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4437.46)            |

| 4442.46 | 4447.46 | What if we moved it from, you know, finance to public services?                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4442.46)            |
| 4447.46 | 4451.46 | Mr. Swanson may be able to add his two cents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4447.46)            |
| 4451.46 | 4453.46 | Mr. Evans, go ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4451.46)            |
| 4453.46 | 4462.46 | And this is for, in other words, after the, okay, this is the proposed budget ordinance for FY24.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4453.46)            |
| 4462.46 | 4475.46 | After FY24 is over, this has given us the ability to move funds around at that time as we start doing year-end closeout to balance out the funds.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4462.46)            |
| 4475.46 | 4486.46 | This would not open it up to moving it around right now before even the first reading of the budget or second reading is done.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4475.46)            |
| 4486.46 | 4493.46 | This is after the budget is approved, adopted, and then as we go through that year and we get to the end of it and we see, okay,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4486.46)            |
| 4493.46 | 4498.46 | we're short a little here, over a little there, we can fix it within the respective funds.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4493.46)            |
| 4498.46 | 4500.46 | That's always been my understanding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4498.46)            |
| 4500.46 | 4512.46 | And so is there anything, you know, let's say in engineering we budget $8 million for engineering,                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4500.46)            |
| 4513.46 | 4520.46 | but spending is at $10 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4513.46)            |
| 4520.46 | 4528.46 | You know, I'm trying to understand how you get to a scenario where at the end of the year you need to balance the budget.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4520.46)            |
| 4528.46 | 4533.46 | Like when are you allowed to go above and beyond what's been budgeted already?                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4528.46)            |
| 4533.46 | 4541.46 | Well, we don't go above and beyond what's in a particular fund.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4533.46)            |
| 4541.46 | 4547.46 | That's got to be approved by this body by a budget amendment.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4541.46)            |
| 4547.46 | 4550.46 | But normally, like let's take the general fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4547.46)            |
| 4550.46 | 4555.46 | That's usually where you've got the most issues, and generally they're small.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4550.46)            |
| 4555.46 | 4560.46 | Let's say fire, Chief Sharp hit next year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4555.46)            |
| 4560.46 | 4565.46 | He's a little bit over budget for something or a myriad of things.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4560.46)            |
| 4565.46 | 4572.46 | And Chief Noel with KPD is, you know, they've got some additional money.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4565.46)            |
| 4572.46 | 4580.46 | At the end of the FY, as we're closing it out, got the audit going on, then we would balance it out that way.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4572.46)            |
| 4580.46 | 4583.46 | But that's for the, those are for the exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4580.46)            |
| 4583.46 | 4587.46 | They're always going to be a little bit, but, you know, we keep an eye on it through the year,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4583.46)            |
| 4587.46 | 4594.46 | so there's not huge surprises at the end of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4587.46)            |
| 4594.46 | 4599.46 | So back to my question, if you don't mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4594.46)            |
| 4599.46 | 4609.46 | Would we be, within the general fund, if we move money around within the general fund,                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4599.46)            |
| 4609.46 | 4621.46 | would the administration be able to, you know, not follow what council has voted on                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4609.46)            |

| 4626.46 | 4630.46 | and move it to other spending priorities?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4626.46)            |
| 4630.46 | 4633.46 | Yeah, I think I'm going to have the law director try to field this,                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4630.46)            |
| 4633.46 | 4639.46 | and then we'll, since the five minutes are up, we'll go on to the next person who had their light on.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4633.46)            |
| 4639.46 | 4649.46 | I think that really gets back to, you can, as we have discussed, for example,                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4639.46)            |
| 4649.46 | 4654.46 | take $50,000 away from the police department, give it to the fire department.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4649.46)            |
| 4654.46 | 4659.46 | But you can't say specifically how those funds are to be spent within that department.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4654.46)            |
| 4659.46 | 4660.46 | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4659.46)            |
| 4660.46 | 4666.46 | So what you could do is take $50,000 away from the fire department,                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4660.46)            |
| 4666.46 | 4670.46 | give $50,000 more to the police department.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4666.46)            |
| 4670.46 | 4675.46 | They would be in those departments, and the department heads                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4670.46)            |
| 4675.46 | 4680.46 | and the administration would decide whether or how to spend those funds.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4675.46)            |
| 4680.46 | 4687.46 | And if you came to the end of the year and you still had that $50,000 discrepancy,                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4680.46)            |
| 4687.46 | 4694.46 | then the finance department would true up, if somebody's over budget by some amount,                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4687.46)            |
| 4694.46 | 4699.46 | they would true up the funds there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4694.46)            |
| 4699.46 | 4706.46 | I don't think it would accomplish what you're suggesting.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4699.46)            |
| 4706.46 | 4712.46 | I guess cynically you could try to do that, but that would be a really poor way to go about it.                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4706.46)            |
| 4712.46 | 4718.46 | A better way to go about it would be to appropriate the funds                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4712.46)            |
| 4718.46 | 4723.46 | and put them back in the department you want them in if you want to do something else.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4718.46)            |
| 4723.46 | 4729.46 | For example, if that amendment happened,                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4723.46)            |
| 4729.46 | 4737.46 | then the administration throughout the year could propose an amendment to the budget again to ship those funds back.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4729.46)            |

| 4766.46 | 4774.46 | It used to be years ago that we would talk about the 1% and say it's set aside a reserve.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4766.46)            |
| 4774.46 | 4779.46 | I think you can look back to some old budgets and see that.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4774.46)            |
| 4779.46 | 4782.46 | It was kind of silly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4779.46)            |
| 4782.46 | 4787.46 | It's got nothing to do with anything because we never used it ever.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4782.46)            |
| 4787.46 | 4798.46 | So what happens is we are maintaining that 1% and our required reserves just like we always are,                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4787.46)            |

| 4809.46 | 4816.46 | I was just trying to help clarify why citizens won't see anything about the reserve                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4809.46)            |

| 4856.46 | 4862.46 | I would assume based on my experience that when budgets are trued up,                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4856.46)            |
| 4862.46 | 4866.46 | it's really not significant amounts of money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4862.46)            |
| 4866.46 | 4872.46 | So if it were, if council said we want to move $2 million somewhere,                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4866.46)            |
| 4872.46 | 4877.46 | it couldn't just sit there and then come back at the end of the year to be trued up.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4872.46)            |
| 4877.46 | 4881.46 | That would have to take a budget amendment, I assume, to move money.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4877.46)            |
| 4881.46 | 4885.46 | That significantly from one department to another.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4881.46)            |

| 4886.46 | 4887.46 | That's correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4886.46)            |

| 4888.46 | 4890.46 | I'll just give you an example, real world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4888.46)            |

| 4895.46 | 4898.46 | expenditures where we had some extra and stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4895.46)            |

| 4903.46 | 4906.46 | and it was coming from other places in the world to the United States                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4903.46)            |
| 4906.46 | 4910.46 | and we got together and we thought we're not going to make anything                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4906.46)            |

| 4932.46 | 4934.46 | well, let me ask this question first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4932.46)            |
| 4934.46 | 4937.46 | In Section VI, it says respective funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4934.46)            |
| 4937.46 | 4940.46 | Am I to interpret that as departments?                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4937.46)            |

| 4950.46 | 4953.46 | I mean, there's various types that are set out in governmental accounting.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4950.46)            |

| 4996.46 | 4999.46 | you would see that in a budget amendment that would come to you.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4996.46)            |

| 5002.46 | 5006.46 | and say, yeah, $1,000 or $2,000, it would not come before this body.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5002.46)            |

| 5013.46 | 5018.46 | My next question is, what is that threshold between a million and $1,000?                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5013.46)            |

| 5068.46 | 5072.46 | Ms. Parker, we're recording that question,                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5068.46)            |

| 5077.46 | 5081.46 | And then just a motion I wanted to make was that we go ahead                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5077.46)            |
| 5081.46 | 5087.46 | and postpone the second reading of the budget ordinance and tax.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5081.46)            |

| 5094.46 | 5098.46 | and then afterwards have a separate motion to postpone the second reading.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5094.46)            |
