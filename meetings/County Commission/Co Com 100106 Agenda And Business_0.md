| 0:00:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| Everybody have a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=10)|
| 0:00:21| And I guess we're going to accept everything that's on the agenda that you should have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=21)|
| 0:00:27| We have a number of items here to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=27)|
| 0:00:31| But before I go to that, I'll go ahead and recognize Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, or Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=35)|
| 0:00:37| I would like to add an item to the agenda that is a discussion and possible review and action of the audit of our internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=37)|
| 0:00:46| That was released yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| I'd like to put that on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| I'm not asking that we talk about it during our committee meetings, but I think at our regular agenda meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| I'd like to have that up for discussion, review, and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| A regular meeting on the 25th as a discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Well, Mr. Chairman, yesterday the Audit Committee accepted, voted to accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| and recommend to the full commission by way of resolution that they accept also the audit, the peer review audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| So that will be a discussion item as we discuss whether to accept it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Then I don't think we need both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| We already got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| That would be redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| I want to just ask Joe, as my two colleagues to both sides spoke to, should we have two resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=88)|
| 0:01:39| I just want your suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| We accepted the KPMG, the general audit, and also the peer review from the ATA group in Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=100)|
| 0:01:49| I just want to defer to you and get your recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| If those two both items should be placed as resolutions to be accepted and debated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=112)|
| 0:01:59| and voted up or down to be accepted, I guess, by the full commission or just put it on as discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| I would just put it on discussion, sir, because the report is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| It's not one that can be modified or amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| You either accept the report or you don't, and you debate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| But regardless, the vehicle by which to discuss that just has to be put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| You don't want to get an enacting resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| The audit committee actually did vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| We voted unanimously to accept these items as they were presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| and that's why I was just charged with bringing it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| We spoke about it briefly to Jolie yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| What do you think, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Well, we accepted those reports, but they do, I think, commission authorized that they be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| They should have the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| How do we get it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| That's the question I think we're dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| And also, we have the Rutherford Moss School Activities Report audit also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| We actually received three audits on behalf of commission yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| Yes, but just what I'm getting at is the vehicle by which to bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| It's certainly acceptable just to add it to the agenda and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| You don't need an enabling resolution to accept reports that essentially you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=188)|
| 0:03:16| created, so to speak, or you sought to have created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| So therein lie three items to be added, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| Three separate discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| I would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| I would think it's cleaner that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| You take each one on its own merit and just put them on the agenda for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| And then, Commissioner Shouse, while we're still at this, there are a couple others, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| The hotline, the hotline item, what was the fourth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| That's fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| The other was a draft of how issues raised by the hotline would be disseminated to other interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=225)|
| 0:03:56| There are actually five items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Three are audits that we represented and accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| And then two are the hotline and the draft of the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| And it's fairly, it's more voluminous than it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| You know, just hotline, you call it in, report something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| There's a lot of more detail that I want commission to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| I think the audit committee wants commission to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Therefore, we're adding five items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Regarding the hotline, you would add, one, the mechanics of the hotline, in other words, how it's created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| what money you're going to possibly expend, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| And then, two, what you do once you receive information transmitted via the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| So I think that's the distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| One is actually the mechanics of the hotline, the RFP process, monies involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| And secondly would be once it's actually in place, what then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Is that clear and agreeable then that we have five items to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Jolie's got it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Okay, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| We're going to have all of these as separate items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| I would like to add, and maybe just right after Mr. Hammond is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| I want to look at the solid waste department for an audit for the solid waste department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| while we're talking about audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| I've got that down as one of the things to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| You've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Let's just go through what I've already got here to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| I've got a resolution approving the ball camp elementary utility easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| a resolution requesting an audit of the solid waste department, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| Then we've got the audit committee had those items, so we've taken care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| And then a resolution to approve a contract amendment with the Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| And I have a resolution approving a memorandum of understanding from the Retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| and Pension Board for services for payment of operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=355)|
| 0:06:04| That's Commissioner Ivan Harmon has asked that to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| And I've asked that the Farragut Golf Team has won the state championship for the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| and I think we need to honor them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| I want to ask that that be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Commissioner Hammond, if you'd like to be added to that, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| And if it's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Commissioner Briggs would like to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| He's welcome to anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| Mr. Director, I'm on the board for Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| In your opinion, do I need to recuse myself from that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| You don't derive any direct benefit from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| You don't seek any favor, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| It's a charitable organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| I think the fact that you've disclosed it publicly suffices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| I don't see any issues with the ethics code over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Your life was your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| You lit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| I could tell you wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| I'd like to add a resolution honoring the Carter High School Band for their successful participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| in the New Year's Day Parade in London, England.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| Anything else to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| Co-sponsor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| And Commissioner Armstrong would like to co-sponsor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| Yes, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Mr. Chairman, if we could, if we could add at the request of the mayor a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| nominating three members to the E911 Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| And I do have names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Those could be entered into the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| If you'll just get those to us, we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to address the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| That was drafted by the Retirement and Pension Board attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| and it was part of my volunteer for, anyway, is to review that with the county attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| And that has not happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| And so I just want to, an FYI, is that I want to make sure that we have the county attorney's opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| to review that before we get too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Well, it's on the agenda for the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| And if you have a chance to get with the county attorney between now and then, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| If not, then the commission will act to go ahead and consider it or defer at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| My name is Kathy Maryland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| I'm from Phil Ballard's office, the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| He has asked that I make a resolution to add additional staff to the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| And how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Do you have something to give to the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| and to the law director's office so we can get that all written up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Phil is taking a couple of days off, and that's why I'm down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| If you can get that information so that we can make that part of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| No objection to all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| We'll just add these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| I was going to add not only the people, but the salaries that we're looking at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| And if we could have a listing of what their duties and responsibilities would be as Phil is preparing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Come before the agenda committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| We do have public hearing, and I have a name of Jamie Dodd with the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=564)|
| 0:09:35| If you'll just identify yourself by name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| My name is Jamie Dodds, and I live at 2509 Lakefront Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| I'm the president of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| and I'm here this afternoon representing 176 local members of our league to share our position regarding revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=591)|
| 0:10:00| to the Knox County Charter, particularly addressing the process of recalling an elected official from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| The League of Women Voters supports actions to simplify the election process, making it more fair and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=607)|
| 0:10:17| The league is in agreement with all the proposed revisions except the revision that would require signatures on the petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| to recall an elected official to be 25 percent of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| It's our understanding that this revision could require over 30,000 signatures on a countywide petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=631)|
| 0:10:39| We believe that the cost and effort in acquiring this many signatures places an undue burden on individuals trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=639)|
| 0:10:47| to obtain a petition to require a recall election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| The citizens of Knox County deserve a recall process that is fair and not too cumbersome, yet one that cannot be abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=651)|
| 0:11:00| If there is just cause to remove an official, we want the decision to be in the hands of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| Therefore, we urge the county commission to carefully reconsider your decision on the number of required signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| Several proposals were discussed at the December 14th commission meeting that would better reach a middle ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| such as 15 percent of votes cast in the last gubernatorial election or 50 percent of the votes cast in the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| of the official being considered for recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| The League of Women Voters of Knox County appreciates your consideration on this important matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| and trusts that you will put the principles of fairness and balance in the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| when making your decision on the recall issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| And I also just want you to know that Barbara Nicodemus had worked very hard on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| and had hoped to be here today and was ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Anyway, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Anything else come before the agenda committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Ivan, we have decided to add there to what you asked about the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Commissioner Briggs, I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| I have added an item to honor the Farragut Golf Team for winning state championship the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| And Commissioner Hammond, you would like to be added too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Anything else come before the agenda committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| If not, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| Are we coming back into session for this other thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| Well, now that it's 145, we're now into in session for our public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Could we make sure that Ms. Dobbs' remarks get recorded in this meeting because that was really what she was speaking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| If we'll make sure that gets those comments are going to be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| The only item on our public hearing today is a discussion about the possible replacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| and recall of an official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| And do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| If I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, before we begin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| I do have the ordinance that's the most current iteration of that which we've been asked to draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| Copies have been provided to Greg McKay, election supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| who has forwarded the same to the state election commission just as a matter of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| I have that here and extra copies for anyone in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| With your permission, I'll hand them out, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| I'd just like to make a couple of comments on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| First, what we did at our last commission meeting on the first reading is we passed part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=831)|
| 0:14:00| except for the I guess you'd call it the part that was a little bit more controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| and what we really needed to decide on and what we'd appreciate the input from the public on is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| or how many signatures do you need to put a person on the ballot to be recalled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| And that's really where I think the focus of this will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| I would like to add that Mr. Jarrett and Mr. McKay and I have had multiple and also Scott Firth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| you know, with the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| We've had multiple almost like a brainstorming sessions here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| and then also on the Internet just to try to fine tune some of the language on this other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| And I think what Mr. Jarrett's handing out now reflects some of those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| But really what this deals with primarily is how many signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| and how do we want to determine what the number of signatures are on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| If not, I think I saw Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=903)|
| 0:15:12| Do you have anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Are you fine with if you had a chance to read this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| Do you have any comments, concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=919)|
| 0:15:29| I'm Greg McKay, the Administrator of Elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| And, yes, we've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| As the doctor mentioned, we've gone, you know, back and forth working this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| And I think it addresses the concerns that we had from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| The minor one about the wrong number, the confusion about what the question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| And also we have sent it on to the State Coordinator's Office, who I've already talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| And she said it looked good, but we had a few minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| So Beth Henry-Robinson is going to be looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| So, you know, I think it addresses all the concerns that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Do you expect any possible changes between now and the 25th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Tweaking is one thing, but substantive changes is what we're most concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Syntax and structure, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| But if we're talking substantive changes, we'll need to know as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I think the only outlying question was near the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| The wording of K, I wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| That won't be anything substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| At one point, Ms. Robertson said something about putting in become effective for all recalls on and after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| But I'm not sure how that's any different from what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| That's form over substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| That's pretty, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| I'm just worried about them changing something where the Commission will have to look at it once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| as a renewed, fresh one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| No, I think it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| I think it's something about once it's been passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| and that would include the Election Commission certifying the election, not necessarily the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| because until it's certified by the Election Commission, then nothing's passed or voted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| So, however best to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Question on the violation for someone who is threatening an individual who is wanting to sign a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| And as I understand it, there would be a $1,000 fine if someone were to directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| or indirectly threaten someone who was going to either initiate a recall or sign a recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| Do we have the authority of putting jail time in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| Well, sir, this no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I mean, the county itself can't deprive someone of civil liberties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| This is that which is permitted by state election code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| But if they're found guilty of it, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Well, that would be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| But then again, that would be under a state statute and be directed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| and enforced by the state district attorney general, not the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| So if someone were to be found guilty of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| and the judge would have the option then of giving them the $1,000 fine plus any state remedies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| This would be something that would be a county administrative fine rather than a state penal or punitive fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| It's a good question, and it's a slim dynamic indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| The only questions that have been posed to me regarding this proposed ordinance is that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1118)|
| 0:18:47| that Ms. Dobbs spoke to, and that is the percentage or the number of voters that need to sign a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| Now, if we were to make a change in the second reading on that, would that be a substantive change, Mr. Law Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| There's no bright-line rule, but I think that a court would consider that a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| You probably have to look at that and do it once again as a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| That was my question also, and my personal preference would be, as she mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| the 50 percent of those that voted in that race for that particular person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| I mean, if you're going to recall someone, it's pertaining to a particular race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| I think that should determine the number of signatures it would take to do the recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| My only problem with that, though, Commissioner, is when you have a contested race versus an uncontested race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| you could have a substantially different amount of people who vote in that race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| If you take a look at the countywide for, say, the sheriff, which was a contested race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| versus the property assessor or someone who was uncontested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| and you end up having a substantially different amount of voters in that race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| And I don't think that one countywide race should be or a recall, the number of signatures for a recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1211)|
| 0:20:20| for one countywide official should be any different from another countywide elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| And that's my problem with basing it on how many people voted in that particular election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1227)|
| 0:20:37| Well, it just seems, though, that if, I mean, there are certain elected positions that have greater authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1237)|
| 0:20:49| and significance and interest than others and, consequently, more in the headlines and more responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1249)|
| 0:21:01| So, to me, someone in a position like that should have, you know, should have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1261)|
| 0:21:13| I just think it's simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| We already have a different provision in the charter, and we go back to the number of voters in the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1276)|
| 0:21:26| I think it's even better than, in my opinion, than going by a certain percentage of how many registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1286)|
| 0:21:37| Because, as Greg McKay will tell you, that's a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| And if we have a specific set known number that we have to have, then I just think that's best, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1301)|
| 0:21:51| It would be the simplest, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| We can argue what that percentage should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| but I just think basing it on the last gubernatorial election is just an easier way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| I think that opens up an issue that I think we really need to discuss in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| It goes back to the last commission meeting we divided the question between should we have recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1332)|
| 0:22:20| That was the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| The second question was then by what number of signatures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| Can I correct you on just one point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| It's not whether or not to have a recall, but to change our recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Well, we have a recall in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| We're changing our recall process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| That's not really what my point was going to be, that we basically can come with then three different places of getting the universe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1363)|
| 0:22:56| We can get those that voted for that office last time or those that are registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| or those registered voters that voted in the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| And I think that's the place that the number comes from needs to be decided first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| In other words, I'm suggesting we divide the question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| We should continue to have that divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| And where does the number come from first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| And then second, we should decide the percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| Ultimately, and correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| I think procedurally when we get to that point in our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| we're going to have to decide, I think, the number first since that's probably going to be the more controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| because ultimately it's going to be one item that's placed on the ballot in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| And it's going to have to be one item that is passed by this commission to place it on the item, that item on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1436)|
| 0:24:05| So the commission as a whole, we can't just approve all wordings except this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| and then possibly come back and say, well, now we're going to change the numbers unless we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| Ultimately, all we do is change the procedure of the recall and we end up not addressing the number of signatures at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| And then it would be left at 15% of all registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| And I think, Dr. Briggs, if, you know, you're the one bringing this forward to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| and it depends on sort of how you would want to, and I guess then ultimately the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| how you'd want to proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| Because we have to come up with 13 votes to place anything on the ballot on a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| I'm not suggesting that anything be left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| I'm just asking that rather than jumping back and forth between this percentage of that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| let's decide what the basis of where we're coming from would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Do we want to decide to use how many votes were cast in that office last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Are we going to use registered voters or are we going to use the last gubernatorial election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| And once that's decided, then I can then focus on what the percentage might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| Of any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Of any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| And I'm not adverse to any of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Let's just pick which one of the three we want to use and then that's the one we're going to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| I didn't want to leave anything out of what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| I just want us to do it a step at a time and that step be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| and then we know where we're headed to from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| The last time we discussed it, we bounced back and forth between this percentage of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| and as we say 25 percent today, if I take the handout that I've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1557)|
| 0:26:06| do I have to add two lines together to get 25 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| I don't think so, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Well, there's not a 25 percent line on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Well, I mean, oh, I thought you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| He's talking about this sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Lines on a sheet versus I thought lines within a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| So you see, I'm just asking that we do this in a little more orderly fashion than we did it the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1582)|
| 0:26:31| Greg McKay, if you could, for the benefit of commission, could you give us what the 25 percent of the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1591)|
| 0:26:43| gubernatorial election, which is what we passed last month, so we'll have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Has anybody got one of those charts we passed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| I believe it's 3621.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Yeah, but if you could just provide us that information come the 25th so we'll have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Yeah, we've got it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| I think that number's in front of us right now, but I have 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Well, I don't have that sheet in front of me, so I don't know what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| The next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Yeah, it's 30,621.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| I just don't have it in front of me, so maybe you all have it with the 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| I just remember last month it didn't have the 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| It had a 10 and it had a 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| And you had to add it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| It's still that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| We can do that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| We can add them together for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| It's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| So if you could just provide us a new chart that has the 25 percent so we can just know what exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| You know, one of the other things when we go through this procedurally at the night of the commission meeting that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| think we should do, and some of that could even be determined here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| but we don't have all of the commission members here, is that when we're trying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| just as Commissioner Wright mentioned, when we're trying to decide what are we going to use as our basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| and then what are we going to use as the percentage is when we're voting on some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| about what we're deciding to do, not let that be perceived or determined to be a final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| Because there's things that, you know, that I may have a preference for that I would like to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| But I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| You know, what I think the most important thing that we do is that we correct the recall amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| that's present there now and put something in its place because we need to have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| But, you know, like if we're going to vote, do we want 20 or 25 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| And let's say we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Someone says, okay, let's try 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| But if that failed, I wouldn't want that to kill the whole amendment as a second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| where we can't bring it back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| See, some of this is deliberation and then some of it will be the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| That's sort of what I was trying to get back to with how we do this procedurally is the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| and approval of all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Then you amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| And you have substitute motions to amend the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| And then we can get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Then you get all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Once you pass the amendments, then you need to come back all the way to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| Pass the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| And pass the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Is that the way we should do that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Greg, going back to what David was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| At the meeting, you may want to have some stuff where we can put it up on the screen, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| because there are going to be a lot of people in the audience if you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| And have it broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| You know, just have every scenario broken down for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| If we go this way, what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| You know, actually, I think that the sheet that you gave us was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| And if you just put one more line in that first group, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| and just where it's the 25 percent, because that's what's really on the table right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| Do you want the three scenarios when you say every scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| Well, there can be a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| I think if you just added the 25 percent, then we would pretty much have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| For some of us, we'd like the 20 percent option in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| Yeah, you could put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| People look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| So you might do the 15, 20, and 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| You've got the 15 and a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Yeah, 10 percent of registered voters there is there, 15 percent are registered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| and you have 10, 15, and 25 percent, 20 and 25 percent of the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| I think that's what you're saying, aren't you, Finbar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| And then below that, we already have the 50 percent of those cast, which was the original one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| which was the original one that was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| And those numbers are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Do you have any more questions, Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Yeah, you know, I forgot something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Let me bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| On 2F, if a majority of the voters vote no, the incumbent shall remain in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| If a majority of the voters vote yes, the incumbent shall be deemed recalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| What if there's a tie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| What if there's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| A tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| In my opinion, that should be a failed vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| You know, maybe what we need to do is just simply say if the majority of the voters vote yes for recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| the incumbent shall be removed from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Well, if it's a majority, it's not a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| That's what he's saying, a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Okay, the way we have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Like a majority plus one and they're recalled, and if not, they're not or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Well, a majority is 50 percent plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| A state law address is what to do when candidates tie, but it seems to me to be silent on recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| It's silent on recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Tennessee Code Section 28111 reads that if there's a tie vote regarding a county election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| the county legislative body casts the deciding vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| It is silent as to recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| It would appear the attorney general has dealt with this, so we'd appreciate if you wouldn't ponder things that aren't in law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| You know, I think what we should do on that, if we eliminate the first sentence, then we'll take care of it, won't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1910)|
| 0:32:01| Because it just simply says if a majority of the voters vote yes, the incumbent shall be deemed recalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| I may have a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| If you just drop that first sentence, then I think that takes care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| Sometimes less is more, syntax prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| It would seem that that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| I would suggest that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| If it's a tie, you don't have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| That's right, and it would fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| All right, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Question, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Let's say that right now I wanted to do something on the wheel tax and I brought you and said, okay, I want to do a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| How many signatures do I need to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Is it based on the registered voters that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Is it based on January 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| At what date do you say, all right, you need to get 10 percent of the registered voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| That's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| I've often wondered that myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I don't know what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| I mean, would you normally just go by the day that the petition would be filed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| What I normally do is what we've done in the past with petitions is I make sure that I know the number of registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| if that's the benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| The day they brought the petition in, the day the commission voted on it, the day they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| every step of the process is where we always know what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| And in practical matter, if you're that close, you're in trouble anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| So, but that's something that would probably have to be litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| I don't know what the answer is to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Well, I was just wondering if there was a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| So, I mean, to me, that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Because if you come in and you say, okay, at what date do you look at registered voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| I mean, that could be litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I mean, if people are going to go through the process of getting signatures and you come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| and say, well, what standard are you using?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| And we say, and as you said, it's, you know, pretty much objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| It changes every, from day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| And then that way, if we look at the percentage of voters in an election, whether it's 50 percent or 10 or 15, 20 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| you have a set number and everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| The other thing, too, is let's say, and looking at the 50 percent, it's going to be different depending on the county wide ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| It could be anywhere from 17,000 for the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| No, pardon me, the sheriff's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| I'm looking at the 17,000, which would be the county law director, versus 24,000 for the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2043)|
| 0:34:11| So, and it's all in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| So, if you do the 50 percent, depending on the office, it's going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| So, I guess I'm kind of leaning toward let's have a set number that everybody understands what the number is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| whether it's a county wide office or whether it's a district office such as commission or school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| We'll have to change it then for the district because, see, that will be different for each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| Well, it would be different if it were 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| If it's 25 percent of those that voted in the district in the last gubernatorial election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| that's going to be different in every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| It will be different for every district, but at least it's a set known number for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2083)|
| 0:34:56| I like your idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Is there anybody in the audience that would like to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| I know we already had Ms. Dodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| So, is there anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| If you'll just come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| When you come up, if you give us your name and your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| My name is Greg Lowness, 8306 Tazewell Pike, Corrington, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| And I agree with Commissioner Wright that we need to decide, or I hope that you folks can decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| where this number is going to come from, the percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Because I can stand up here and argue with you right now over a broad base of these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| but unless we know exactly where we're going, it's pointless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| It's in theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| So, I would like, hopefully, for the commission to decide where the number, the base, is going to come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| and then allow the public some input there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| So, your suggestion, sir, then, would be that we decide whether it's the gubernatorial election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| whether it's the number of voters in the last election for that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| or if it's registered voters, and then argue about the percentages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Just looking at your sheet here, there's 14 or, I'm sorry, it looks like six different possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2172)|
| 0:36:21| So, you know, I appreciate looking at their spreadsheet and trying to figure out this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| but without knowing where you're coming from, the public cannot give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| I can tell you my opinion, and my opinion is, as you probably heard already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| I prefer that we stick with the gubernatorial because then we know we have a known set number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| and then whatever that percentage is, it's just easy to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| That percentage can mean a great deal, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| We can argue about the percentage, but you were talking about what basis do you come up with first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| and then you, you know, how do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| I just want you to decide where the percentage is going to come from, not the percentage amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Is it going to come from the governor's race or the local, the elected official or the registered voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| In my opinion, I prefer that it come from the gubernatorial, but that's just mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| I'm just one of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| What I'm asking of commission, though, would decide that first and then allow public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| I don't think we can do that because we won't know until it's voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| We won't be, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| That's why we need the public input before we do because it doesn't matter if we sit up here today and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| I mean, if we had 19 people here today because we're not voting on it today and we decide on 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| the night of the meeting, somebody can change, I mean, and you can give us the input or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| and then the night of the meeting, we have one chance because we've got to vote on it that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| Somebody might say 30 percent or somebody might say 20, and then we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| If it passes, it's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| So, we have to have the input before we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| I think the working document right now is 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| Right now, what was passed last month and what the original motion that will be before us is 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| It's 25 percent of the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| I would prefer that we keep it based on gubernatorial election, but I'm just one of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| And those numbers are not listed on this, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| I'll tell you what they are for the 8th District is that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| the present recall amendment says that you would need 4,024 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| And if you do it on 25 percent of the people that voted in the 8th District in the gubernatorial election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| it will be 31, it will be 3,143.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| So, it cuts about 900 signatures less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2313)|
| 0:38:42| Do you happen to have the sheet that came from that we're talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Yeah, that's what I'm working off of also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| I would like to see the county commission put the power back to the people and have a reasonable number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| so that the citizens, the voters, can obtain something without having to take out a personal loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| to hire people to get signatures, especially out in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| We don't have a large meeting place out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| We're banned from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| I went to several schools myself trying to work on a recall, told to leave by Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| So, it needs to be something that is obtainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| And I got to watch the video from the last meeting where you're at, and one of the commissioners said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| we'll go through a recall process continuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Well, the city has had it at a much lesser rate percentage-wise, and they've not ever had a recall effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| So, I do think that it needs to be lower than what is projected by what Mr. McKay handed out today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| of the 25 percent of the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Commissioner Briggs, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| I mean, I tell you, the only thing that I had to say, did you all want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| I mean, the only thing I can have, Mr. Lowness, the only thing I can have to say is that I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| You know, my original proposal was for 50 percent of the votes cast in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| And for that, it would have been, I believe it would have been 2,334, which is about another 800 less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2409)|
| 0:40:20| So, we're talking about 1,000, roughly, you know, 1,800, 1,700 less than what the present recall has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2420)|
| 0:40:29| I mean, that's my preference, but I'm not sure that my colleagues up here would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| If we took 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| I've worked on two petition drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| The Will Tax Petition Drive I worked on collected about 1,200 signatures in five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| Easy, no problem whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| We were allowed to sit at Kroger's, Weigel's, wherever we wanted to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| I worked on a recall petition to recall my school board member in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| And it's not, it's total different when you're trying to affect the entire county as it is when you're trying to work with just one district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2451)|
| 0:41:02| The 8th District is very rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| You all know all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| I don't need to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| It touches five counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| It's hard to get 4,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| It's going to be hard to get 2,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| It was hard to get the signatures that we got, just under 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| And we're looking at 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| That's 12 Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| I just think that it does need to be something a little bit easier for the average citizen, concerned citizen, to affect this in our recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2478)|
| 0:41:29| And I think 25 percent of what we have here, 25 percent of the governor's race is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| It should be lowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| Just as a proposal, what would you, you know, what would you propose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| What do you think, you know, for instance, there were, I think there were, I don't have the numbers for the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2502)|
| 0:41:51| on how many people voted in the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| But what do you think would be a reasonable number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| I believe in the 8th District there were 4,668 people that voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| I think 15 percent would be a reasonable number if we're going to stay with the governor's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| I respect what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| No, I'm not up here asking for the million, but 15 percent is a reasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| It only takes 25 to get your name put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| And we're trying to do a recall here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| It doesn't automatically recall you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| It just puts it back on the ballot so the folks, you know, of the community can go back out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| Do we want to keep this person or do we want to let this person go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| You know, that's all we're asking is for a fair chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Mr. McKay, did you have something you wanted to add before we go to the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| We just thought of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| Sometimes the precincts are split by school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| For example, Gresham, or Shannondale, some of the people who voted Shannondale vote in the second school board district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| and some of them vote in the seventh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| And if we use the gubernatorial numbers of the people that voted in Shannondale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| I don't know how to split them up into the school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2587)|
| 0:43:15| Now, none of the county commissions are split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| None of the precincts are split by county commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| But they are for school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Now, that may change in a year, but it may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| So, something to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| That's two separate precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| You've got Shannondale City and Shannondale County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| Okay, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| You should have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Farragut High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Farragut High is another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| It's split between the fifth school board and the sixth school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| I don't know how to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| It's a secret ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| We don't know how to break it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| You've got Farragut High School North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| You've got Farragut High School South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Bell Morris is split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Sixteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| And you've got people voting at Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| Some of them are in the fifth and some of them are in the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Well, I thought the precinct was supposed to be whatever the was supposed to coincide with the town limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2646)|
| 0:44:18| Well, it doesn't do that either, but that's a whole other kettle of fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| But take the Bell Morris precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| You know, some of them vote for one school board and some for the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| I guess maybe you could, I don't know, print out all the names and sort them out like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| Well, it sounds like we need to have districts that are a little more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| You know, the other thing that we could do on this is that we could just put another provision in what section is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2682)|
| 0:44:52| In section C that deals just with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| And in that case, if we wanted to take a percentage of the people that voted in the previous election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| And the previous, you know, for that particular school board office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| Would that be considered a substantial change, Mr. Law Director, if we did it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| Currently, the way it reads, I suspicion it just might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| But if I could ask the election supervisor, let's say we have to go back to square one next commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| and then have to do a first reading and then a second reading in the subsequent meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| Are we still within the window of opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| I think so, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| See, it doesn't go on until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| I just want to make sure that we don't presume anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| If it gets to be March and April and this is not finalized, then we might have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| You've certainly got another month to make sure we get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| I'm sure we're driving you guys crazy with all these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| No, I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| It sounds like we're going to have some substantive changes come the 25th anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| So, I mean, nobody's agreeing right now with the 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| I mean, I don't think we could get a consensus on 25 percent right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| So, taking out a line here and putting it in another paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| I think you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Dealing with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| I mean, I would vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| But I think the point that what he's talking about here with the school board is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| Well, we'll have to think of it and figure out a way around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| And if you could put some thought into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| I think it's the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| If we did go back for the particular school board elections and, I mean, you know, personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| I'd like to keep it simple and do it the same way in all the elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| But if we did go back to the school board, if we went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| and took it as a certain percentage of the people that voted in that particular election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| then that would solve the problem, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Well, we can figure out that number very easily, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| And there are seven precincts involved that are split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| School board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Yes, but what we would have to do, though, even if it was not, even if there was not a split precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| we would want to make it consistent for all the school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| Yes, because you don't know what it's going to be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2838)|
| 0:47:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| You're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Just name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| Hello, my name is Anthony Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Address is 2629 Sunset Avenue, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| I wanted to speak to back up Greg's thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| I've talked to about 200 people since the last meeting I was here with you guys last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| and I called them just specifically on this recall issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| And everybody tells me that they're concerned that you can't have a system where it's too hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| to get somebody pulled out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| The recall needs to be doable, not to pick on people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| not to recall somebody because they made one vote that you didn't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| But the two instances that we've been working on the last few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| and people have been working very hard at getting this done when they have been coerced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| they have been threatened, they have had personal property destroyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| they have had cops pulling them over because the guy went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| and made friends with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| All this stuff is making us look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| When you have a bad apple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| you make the rest of the apples look good by getting rid of the rotten apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| But it has to be doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Not simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Not 500 votes or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| But it needs to be a lot less than 3,000 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| So whatever figure we come up with, it needs to be doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| And it needs to be something that the public can understand real quick, real easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| that this is going to be X amount of percentage of this, X amount of percentage of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| and this is going to equal this amount of people, this one is going to equal this many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| and this one is going to equal this many people, but it needs to be doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| If you're doing a good job and you represent your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| and you're not doing things completely off the wall terribly wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| you should have no problem and not be worried about somebody pulling you out of your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| They may disagree with you, but they're not going to call a recall just because they disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| So I commend Dr. Briggs on bringing it up and ask the rest of the gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| don't worry about somebody doing a recall because, real easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| because they disagree with any vote that you might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| That's not what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| It's about when somebody does something extremely wrong and it needs to be doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| People have to knock on doors, make phone calls, and then, like he said, they still have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| And this is for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| And for the most part, the people I've talked to, this is what they say they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Is there anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| I think the one thing that we may have kind of lost sight of a little bit here is the fact that the numbers we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| talking about here is only to get that on the ballot for the people, all of the people to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3011)|
| 0:50:19| This is not, this 10 or 15 or 25 percent doesn't recall anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| It just gets it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| So that, I think, is, and I think this gentleman is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| it maybe needs to be a little easier than 25 percent to get it on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| but then everybody has a chance to vote on it then, not just that 15 or 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| I'm going to make a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| I know when Commissioner Lambert talked about how easy it was going to be to remove people because someone didn't like one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| I think that the voters, if they see the shenanigans going on where people are trying to pull something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| they'll really be a backlash against that person that's trying to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| that's trying to remove the office holder for frivolous reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| And just exactly what you said, sir, is what I've encountered is if you talk to elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| they want to make it hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| But if you talk to citizens, I personally have not talked to any citizens that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| I don't want to have the ability to recall an elected official that does something immoral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| And I think they would like to have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| And that right and privilege should not be reserved just to the wealthy, as you've mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| where people have to raise their own money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Because what we're doing then is we're going to let the wealthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| and the community decide who stays in office and who doesn't when there's a serious ethical problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3099)|
| 0:51:48| Now, what we have to do, I just want to explain something to you also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| is that this requires two-thirds of the commission to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| And, I mean, I would like to have a much lower threshold than what we have now personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| But the problem is, is if we make it low enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| and we can't get enough of my colleagues here to vote for it and we don't get those 13 votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| this is 13 out of 19, the whole issue will be dead for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| And it remains at 15 percent of all registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| Yeah, and it remains 15 percent of all registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| So what we have to do is that we have to get something that I think is better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| and easier than the system right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| And I think I brought this up at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| The majority of states and governments that have a recall provision in their charters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| or state constitutions, it's 25 percent of the people that voted for that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| That would not be a difficult number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| That would be around 1,000 signatures in, you know, in the case that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| The great thing about our system in our country, about democracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| is everybody in this room that has a position has to be reelected at one point or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| So if that was the case, then next year when the elections come up, four years from now when the election comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| or whatever, we still have the power of vote in that situation right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| Very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Just name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| I'm Erin Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| I live at 8306 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| My husband and I and many, many others from the 8th District, we're not babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| We know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| We threw everything we had, every effort we had into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| We work with Republicans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| We work with people who are interested in school issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| And we fell way short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| But despite our best effort, the voters need to get a chance to recall our school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3227)|
| 0:53:56| But we couldn't give it to them this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| I'm not saying we're not going to try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| But, you know, we have experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| We know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| And despite our best efforts, we couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| We wouldn't make it at the current proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Second of all, I think the best way to measure would be to base it on the votes garnered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| How else do you measure who's interested in this position or that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| I think you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| The numbers would vary greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| It's just like real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Things are only worth what someone will give for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| What the governor's race has to do with anything else, I don't see the connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| Basing the number on the votes garnered in that race or cast in that race is a direct measurement of who's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3277)|
| 0:54:47| So that's my -- I would advocate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| Starting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Fifty percent of that would be cool with me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| It's still really, really, really hard to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| My fallacy to that is this, and I know I spoke for that earlier, but I'm thinking a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| Let's cut it down and make it really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| Suppose you had 16 people voting in an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| You've got 10 Republicans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| You've got five Democrats and one Independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| And the Republican wins by a landslide in this case, big margin, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| So, but those other six, even though he might be doing a good job, if those other six got mad at him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| they could get a petition up in Austin because they would have more than 50 percent of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| No, they wouldn't in Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| They would just put him on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| They put him on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Yeah, but that doesn't remove him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Yes, and even though we're in the minority, we can tilt those numbers because there is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| Well, Commissioner Brown, I would take that a step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| Is that in that election, if he were unopposed, he would have those 10 votes and the other six may not vote in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| And that's what happens a lot because a lot of someone who considers themselves one party or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| a lot of times will not cross lines and vote for that unopposed official or candidate that's in a different party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3378)|
| 0:56:28| Do you realize what this, how much this has cost us citizens to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| It's cost us dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| It's cost us financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| We've gone into debt, I mean, enormously, and we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| So, you know, I just don't think that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| I can't imagine that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| But if this number gets down to, say, 15 percent, where you would have, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| you would have had less than half the number of votes or number of signatures you needed that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| Did you get half the number you needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| You didn't get half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| We needed something in the number of 4,200 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| We had to organize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| We met monthly all summer long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| We had turnouts of 30, 40 people at the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| It was across party lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| But, I mean, most, as you know, most folks, you know, so few people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| And out of that number, so few people are willing to do even something tiny on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| make a phone call, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| There's only a tiny, tiny percentage of people who are actually willing to really do one thing once a month, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| It's a tiny percentage of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Lumpy's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| It was easy if you could make contact with the voter to get him to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| But logistically, going out, my district's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Driving and you look at the driveway and you're like, oh, do I want to tower that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| climb that driveway to get this signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| It is you could do it, but it would take a long time and a lot of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| So it wasn't for lack of effort, but we couldn't do it in that short of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| There was just no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| And you know I'm right because you've all run for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| and you know there's only a few people that actually get up and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| Thank you for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Take care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Is there anybody else in the audience that would like to say, have their say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3506)|
| 0:58:35| If nothing else, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Oh, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| We have to have another public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| I'm looking at Tuesday the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| We're going to be here for finance and intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| I think we need to have one in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| You just want to have that immediately following?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| No, in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| I think we need to have it in the evening time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| In the evening time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| I'm looking at maybe 530 or 5 o'clock, 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| Set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| And whoever can make it can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| That's the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| That would be the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Yeah, because the 18th is Martin Luther King Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| The 19th, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| Jody will send out a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| There might be council meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| What time do you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Can we do it in the afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| You know, I guess one of the things that we will have to decide, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| when we have our commission meeting is what we're going to do about the school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| If Craig McKay, if you could try to have some of that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| some thoughts on the school board and how to do that with the split districts and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| If you could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| The problem is if you pass it on the gubernatorial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| then you can't ever split a precinct for your districts either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| You've tied your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| I think it's bad to have split precincts myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100106agendaandbusiness?start=3608)|
