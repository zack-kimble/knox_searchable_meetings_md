| 2:41:11| This is really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| I've walked the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| I've been on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| This is really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| But the thing I keep hearing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| development is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| No more flooding will come off of this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| than already comes off of this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| because whatever goes on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| cannot release any more water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| So, while there are legitimate other concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| the flooding concern that keeps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| that I keep hearing from apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| or anything on the site really isn't the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9712)|
| 2:41:56| There is flooding, but this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| whatever's developed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9718)|
| 2:41:59| and something will be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| it should not exacerbate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| Anything that gets developed is going to increase traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9727)|
| 2:42:12| I've sat on the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| Every project that ever got proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| one of the complaints or reasons people did not want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9738)|
| 2:42:22| is they thought it would overpower the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| They did not want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9744)|
| 2:42:25| is they thought it would overcrowd the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| That is said all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9748)|
| 2:42:32| Our schools are overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9752)|
| 2:42:34| Our schools are not adequately funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| We need more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| We are a growing county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| And as we grow, all of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| are going to be overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| That is a issue that is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| Thank goodness we're not Orlando| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9770)|
| 2:42:52| where they were having to build a school a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| I'm not minimizing any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9774)|
| 2:42:57| I'm just saying that that is factually correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| for any development anywhere in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| So this is a real struggle for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9787)|
| 2:43:12| but I intend to support this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9792)|
| 2:43:17| because the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| who is charged with really understanding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| voted it was close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| I expect our vote will be close too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| but the Planning Commission sought to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| And so I intend to support this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| I also know that while office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| people often think office is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| Empty property is also a recipe for bad things to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9823)|
| 2:43:51| Unintended consequences late at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| and weekends when people aren't around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| So I intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9839)|
| 2:44:04| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| The motion on the floor is to approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| Seeing no further questions or discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9852)|

| 3:00:35| Okay, Mr. Givens, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| and then you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| Absolutely. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10841)|
| 3:00:42| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10842)|
| 3:00:43| I live at 1823 Explorer Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10843)|
| 3:00:48| Thank you to the City Council members and the Mayor for passing the additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| for both mobile mills and housing assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| Those services are much needed in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| I apologize for this being at the end of a long meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| but there's much to talk about, so please forgive me while I do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| First, the ordinance item 12A proposed by the Chief of Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10862)|
| 3:01:05| will charge open records requesters, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| for each recording $10 per hour for the first hour of production time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| including search, retrieval, and redaction if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| I want to point out the redaction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| In May of last year, the Supreme Court of the State of California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| overruled a similar law to charge constituents for redaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| Tennessee is obviously not California, but our open records laws are very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| Seeing as how Knox County lost an expensive lawsuit over an open records request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| just a few months ago, the statement of fiscal impact in this ordinance may be a bit off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| Besides legality, charging citizens more money the more the City redacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10895)|
| 3:01:39| seems counterintuitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10899)|
| 3:01:40| Please modify the language for this ordinance to charge for retrieval time only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10900)|
| 3:01:44| and not for redaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10904)|
| 3:01:45| As an aside, it is disturbingly common for officers with long histories of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10905)|
| 3:01:50| to transfer between departments, so I hope that KPD is going the extra mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10910)|
| 3:01:54| to review the complaint histories of any lateral hires that the Chief had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| Second, I feel the need to inform the City Council of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10918)|
| 3:02:02| Sergeant Clinton's homily on not helping the poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10922)|
| 3:02:05| at the Old City Panhandling meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| For some reason, a myth persists that homeless people choose to be homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10927)|
| 3:02:11| because they are not properly motivated to pick themselves up by their bootstraps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| Or, as Sergeant Clinton put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10935)|
| 3:02:16| quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10936)|
| 3:02:17| there is nothing in my being that says we need to give something out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10937)|
| 3:02:21| that makes someone more comfortable to stay on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10941)|
| 3:02:24| End quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10944)|
| 3:02:25| He also mentioned that a serial rapist was allowed to victimize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| eight people in the Blackstock camp before KPD caught the perpetrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| The homeless are constantly victims of assault and other crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| and at least seven have died of exposure this year alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10954)|
| 3:02:37| But if we give them blankets, it will make life on the street too easy for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10957)|
| 3:02:40| By the way, the City does not track homeless deaths, and I wonder why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10960)|
| 3:02:45| Finally, what I really wanted to talk about was the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10965)|
| 3:02:48| since there was no public commentary at that meeting the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10968)|
| 3:02:51| If the free market wants a baseball stadium downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10971)|
| 3:02:54| then let the free market buy a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10974)|
| 3:02:56| If the free market cannot afford a baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10976)|
| 3:02:59| then the City should not assume the risk of loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| for a project that adds little to nothing in benefits for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10982)|
| 3:03:06| There were several, quote, unquote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| benefits to the City touted for the baseball stadium complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10988)|
| 3:03:11| by Mr. Boyd and his team of experts in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| One was areas for walking and picnicking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| which the stadium is located only a few blocks from Caswell Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=10996)|
| 3:03:20| and Knoxville has an amazing length of greenway for a city of its size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| although I would not oppose expanding the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| Another reason that we should have the stadium, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11006)|
| 3:03:28| was that the stadium could be used for business meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11008)|
| 3:03:30| Our convention center is within walking distance of many nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11010)|
| 3:03:33| new, and luxurious hotels that did not require any City funding to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11013)|
| 3:03:37| I'm assuming we're hoping the stadium will poach events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| from our Money Pit Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| The stadium will be a concert venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11021)|
| 3:03:43| Thompson Bowling Arena, the Tennessee Theater, the Civic Auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| In fact, the Rolling Stones played the Civic Auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11027)|
| 3:03:49| at the height of their popularity in 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| Rolling Stones were specifically mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11031)|
| 3:03:53| by one of Mr. Boyd's representatives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11033)|
| 3:03:56| Another possible use for the stadium would be remote area medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11036)|
| 3:03:59| and community services that could be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| Remote area medical provided services at Chilhowee Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| this past weekend, as they usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11044)|
| 3:04:06| And Sergeant Clinton actually had another great quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| regarding community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| He said, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11050)|
| 3:04:11| you've got two options in order to get rid of homeless problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| You either have to build more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| or you've got to get rid of services, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| We also heard that the stadium will attract new customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11060)|
| 3:04:22| to existing downtown shops and restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11062)|
| 3:04:24| Mr. Boyd plans to build $140 million of new shops and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11064)|
| 3:04:29| closer to the stadium than existing downtown shops and retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11069)|
| 3:04:33| There are more false narratives to refute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11073)|
| 3:04:34| but I see I only have a minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11074)|
| 3:04:37| It boggles my mind that Mr. Boyd can openly admit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11077)|
| 3:04:40| that moving his team from Sevierville to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| does not make financial sense for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| despite the fact that he owns so much of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| adjacent to the proposed stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11086)|
| 3:04:48| and then turn around and claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| that there will be a benefit for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| Let the customer who wants baseball pay for baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11092)|
| 3:04:55| The city tax fair should not be subsidizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| an admittedly unprofitable venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11100)|
| 3:05:00| Sorry it's so late, and I yield back my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| Thank you, Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| Council members, that concludes public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| and this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| Have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11109)|
| 3:05:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| Good night, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=11112)|
