| 0:02:47| For the Mayor's Report, this is a reminder again that early voting is continuing for Knoxville City elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| It will continue through next Thursday, August 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| As you all know, voters will decide who will serve as our next mayor, the three at-large City Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| and the 5th District Council representative, as well as our municipal judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| The five early voting locations are the City-County Building, Downtown West, the Love Kitchen, New Harvest Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| and Meridian Baptist Church on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=196)|

| 0:03:41| Also on GoVoteKnoxville.com, we provide links to all of the candidates' websites and social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=221)|

| 0:03:52| This Friday, August 16th at 4 p.m., we'll officially open the new Pavilion and Kayak launch at Sutry Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=232)|
| 0:04:02| The park upgrade features the first City-owned ADA-accessible kayak launch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| so you can come out and see the floating dock, the pavilion, the picnic tables, restrooms, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| You all may recall that in 2016, we opened Sutry Landing Park and Waterfront Drive on the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=254)|
| 0:04:22| It was the City's first new park to open in about 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| and we have a public river walk, an accessible children's playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| and accessible river overlooks with really beautiful views of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| So what we're cutting the ribbon on on Friday is Phase 2 of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| So again, that's Friday, August 16th at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| We'll have some kayaks there. I intend on trying out the new kayak launch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| so I'll be kayaking off and invite council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| I think you all have gotten an invitation, so if you're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| then make sure you let Judith know so we can have enough kayaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| And anybody want to bring your kayaks down on Friday, August 16th at 4 p.m. at Sutry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| we'd love to have you join us for a little paddle after the ribbon-cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| I haven't been paddling all season, so I'm looking forward to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| So here's another reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| The Community Development Department is conducting a series of public meetings to provide information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| and receive feedback for our next five-year consolidated plan, which is a requirement of HUD funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| Your views will help our community development staff, some of whom are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| to prioritize how we allocate federal HUD funds for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| and services for homeless individuals, veterans, single mothers, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| Everyone is invited to attend any of the upcoming six public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| The first one will be held August 19th, 530 to 7 at the Burlington Branch Library on Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=345)|
| 0:05:54| Or you can also take an online survey if you can't make the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| So to either get details on the public meetings or to take the online survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| you can go to our website at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| Finally, the sixth annual Knoxville Asian Festival will be held Sunday, August 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. at World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| That's a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| So Asian Festival is one of the city's biggest one-day cultural celebrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| It keeps growing, and last year some 10,000 to 12,000 people attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| And it was so popular that things got a little snug downtown and on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| So this year the festival will be spreading out a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| and they will be at the World's Fair Park so they can continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| You may recall we've upgraded the performance lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| We opened that for a festival on the 4th, so they'll be spread out there as well as on the festival lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| So again, that's the Knoxville Asian Festival on Sunday, August 25th, from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. at World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| That is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| No? Okay, let's move on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=430)|

| 0:07:28| They organized a walk in District 3 from Northwest Middle School through Victor Ash Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| Thank you to the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Thank you to the city staff that came out, and a lot of candidates were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| We walked about two miles, and my niece did not complain too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Okay, now we are on 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=469)|

| 0:08:10| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=490)|

| 0:08:19| to regulate the location height, bulk, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| There is the percentage of the lot which may be occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| the sizes of yards, courts, and other open spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| the density of population, and the uses of buildings, structures, and land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| for trade, industry, residence, recreation, public activities, and other purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| and for such purposes to divide the municipality into districts or zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| of such number, shape, and areas as it may determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| and regulate the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| and uses of buildings and structures and the use of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| to prescribe penalty for the violation of its provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| and to provide for its enforcement to repeal Ordinance No. 3369,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| known as cited as the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| and all amendments thereto, all as a product of the public process known as Recode Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Okay, so we have five people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| Also, if there's no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| I'm going to ask Council if you would like to first take the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| after we hear from folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Most of the folks who want to speak either want to speak on B or C or both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| so we'll let everybody speak who wants to either address B or C or both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| and then I'd like us to take up the zoning map first as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Then we go to the text as amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| and we'll incorporate the zoning map into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| and so that will be the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| So that would be two votes needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| So let me go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| These are the folks who signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| and I'll tell you the order I have them if you want to be ready to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| First is David Williams, then Greg Mills, Danny Kirby, Sam Emmons, and Jay Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=601)|
| 0:10:12| I'm not sure if he wants to speak or only if certain topics come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=612)|
| 0:10:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| It's unusual for Williams to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| I hope that's a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Yeah, I'm David Williams, 505 Hollywood Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| Wait, let's get our timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Since I was here last, I've now celebrated the 20th anniversary of my 39th birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| A little humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| I want to be real brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| I'm concerned with the section of recode concerning the flagpoles limiting to three to a yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| I noticed there are four flagpoles up there, so it seems City Council would be violating of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| I intend to put the American flag in my yard, in my great-granddad's yard, plus honoring all the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| So that's going to be eight flagpoles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| So unless recode is changed, I'm going to be guilty, and you might want to reserve jail space for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| So my other objection is on recode, if this was in effect, say, 10, 15 years ago, on Southern Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| we would not have El Charro, my great-granddad's house would be in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| We would not have the burgers, Red Onion Restaurant, Dead End Barbecue, and Holy Land Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| So, quite simply, reject recode unless some drastic changes are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Next is Greg Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| Sir, please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Greg Mills, 8313 Richland Colony Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| I actually live in the county, so I just got a quick question about the start date of this, probably for the Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| Have you got anything from TVA saying they're going to be able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| update their mass nuclear evacuation plan by January 1st to support this big change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| You may want to check with them and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| I mean, I think that's maybe a tedious process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| You may want to move that start date back until you see if they've got any recommendations to add an extra road out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| So, just something for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| We will look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Danny Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Danny Kirby, 6332 Bomb Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| I want to address the actual rezoning of people's property and the notice requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=756)|
| 0:12:45| I know now the narrative is, well, we're not really rezoning people's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| but when you start to make change in uses that are allowed, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| if you take an R1A and you take it to an RN1, you lose the right to do a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| And so that's clearly a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| So we are rezoning people's properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| And when it comes to rezoning properties, the ordinance, the current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| is pretty clear in stating that the planning commission shall notify all property owners whose property would be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| and who were not a party to the application for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Now, we all know about the ordinance amendment that came through here last December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| and supposedly altered that language and changed the notice requirement, supposedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=803)|
| 0:13:31| But it didn't, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| In fact, that language to this date still says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| prior to holding public hearings regarding the adoption of comprehensive updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| or revisions to the zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| the planning commission shall publish notice in compliance with Part B1 of this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| No other notice under this part shall be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Notice it doesn't say anything about the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| However, the memo that went out to council from Director Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| stated that the proposed amendment to the MPC administrative rules and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| clarifies that the requirement for mailed notification to property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| does not apply to comprehensive updates or revisions to the zoning ordinance and map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| That's simply not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| And it wasn't true because that's not what got put into the actual ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| So when you make changes to the map, you're required to send notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| And the notice was supposed to go from MPC shortly after the application is presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| So in my opinion, for what it's worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| notice should have gone out from MPC immediately after the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| So 90 public meetings were held to discuss the possible rezoning of people's properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| without notifying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| And then come December, you slide the amendment in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| you send it on to city council, everybody gets up in arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| and city council says, well, wait a minute, we'll send a letter out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| That's not the way the ordinance was supposed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| And the one thing I learned from working at the state planning office is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| the city has broad authority to do a lot of things when it comes to planning and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| but you've got to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| So I'm just saying I don't believe it was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| I don't believe proper notice was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| So here we're going to vote on this map tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| but I don't believe it was handled properly and at the proper procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| Sam Emmons, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=930)|
| 0:15:40| My name is Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Is there a way to raise this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| My name is Sam Emmons, and my address is 301 Woodlawn Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| Thank you for the opportunity to speak briefly about Recode Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| and thank you also for spending so much time looking over this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| and making it what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| The result is a zoning ordinance that I think is a good plan for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| Those of us, in other words, living and working in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| Even as I wrote these remarks, these brief remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| I was reminded of something that I often have difficulty with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| and maybe it will be helpful to mention it this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| So from time to time, I have trouble forming a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| and moving forward with it when the time is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| Is it the time to move ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Is it a perfect plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| And then this uncertainty can be paralyzing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| Anxiety and fear end up ruling the day, and progress gets stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1022)|
| 0:17:12| So a step back and a couple reminders help me move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| First, what does it mean for a plan to be perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| In this case, maybe a plan that would cause no complaints from any citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| It seems ideal at first, but highly unlikely to a more rational line of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| Or in my case, maybe perfect would mean only moving forward in a physics calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| That's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Once I have perfectly understood every piece of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| Again, time is scarce, and grasping after complete perfection doesn't work very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| I'm also not arguing for rash, thoughtless decisions, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| Another source of help for me in this issue is when I have people around me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| who are ready to push ahead and finish a project that really is ready to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| It's kind of nerdy, but there's a Prussian military theorist from the 1800s who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| The worst enemy of a good plan is the dream of a perfect one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1104)|
| 0:18:33| And as much as part of me rebels against that in practice all the time, I know it to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| So it can certainly be stated that I may not understand everything about this ordinance that you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| that you all do after so much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| Nor have I had to weigh in on the various concerns about this ordinance that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| though I have thought about several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| It seems to me that a good plan has been crafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| When looking at the zoning map and the details of what the different zones indicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| I imagine what's possible and get excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| I like to imagine the possibilities in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| There are laws defining and constraining what's possible, ostensibly for the good of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| And if those definitions or limitations are good and not arbitrary or unwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1166)|
| 0:19:34| then this might be a good ordinance we're looking at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| If it is, then we can't let the fear of failing to craft a perfect zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| dominate our thinking and cause stagnation on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| Further, the fear to change, changes to the status quo, often drives opposition, even to good changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1188)|
| 0:19:58| Some of that has entered the dialogue on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| This tendency towards inertia sometimes shuts down wise efforts towards change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| If the zoning ordinance was a bad idea or ill-intended, then such opposition would be well placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| But I don't think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Instead, my belief is that time will show Recode Knoxville is both smart and fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| Some changes need to happen for the long-term good of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| Is this one of them? I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Let's leave a good path forward for Knoxville's present and future residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| instead of leaving them strapped with the present outdated zoning rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Thank you, Mr. Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Mr. Schmidt, did you want to speak or only if certain topics came up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| You're saying you do want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| If it comes up, then we'll call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Okay, so that's the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| It says if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| That's why I didn't call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Right, so I have you and Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Okay, but you don't want to make a general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| All right, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| There's been some questions about the notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| I know, Mr. Swanson, as your office looked into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| could you just brief us on what's required and what we've done to comply with those requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| We have looked very carefully at the requirements for notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| and we think we've more than complied with the requirements for notice that would be required by a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| We think we certainly have a defensible process for going through this recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| including all of the notice requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| and going above and beyond the notice requirements as they currently exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| with notices going out to the owner of each parcel of property that the process was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| We believe that all of that is defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| We believe that it complies with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| and we believe that any person in Knoxville who doesn't at this point realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1335)|
| 0:22:23| that a comprehensive recode process is and has been underway for some time now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1343)|
| 0:22:31| and has not availed themselves of the so many opportunities to engage in that comprehensive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1351)|
| 0:22:41| of redesigning both our code and the maps to the extent that they have been revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| has simply sort of affirmatively failed to participate in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| And so we think we legally comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| and we think we go beyond the legal requirements in complying with notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| It is now appropriate to make a motion, and we're going to take up C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| It would be a motion to adopt the zoning map as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| And now is there a motion to approve the text of recode incorporating into it the zoning map that is as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| Mayor, we just voted to change the order, so we're going to vote on maps first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| We just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| We just changed the order, so now we have to vote on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| No, we just voted on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| We just voted on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| No, we said without – I said earlier if there's no –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Without objection, we will do that, and then he made the motion that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Change to – we voted on C just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| I think procedurally, though, I think we have to have a motion to change the schedule of voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| so that's what I thought the vice mayor was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Okay, so you thought that's what you were voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| So can we just take that vote again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Now we're voting on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Right now we're voting on the map as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Sorry for that confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Do we need to procedurally do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| That's what I was trying to – that's what I think you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| You were making a motion to change the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| No, I was making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Just so everybody's clear with the procedure at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| because Councilman Roberto did not seem to be clear about where we were going with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| why don't we just have a motion to change the order of B and C and vote on that first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| and then we'll go back and do what we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| I will make that motion to change the order and vote on C first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| And I will second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Okay, so that's what we're voting on, to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Now, back to the motion that I just made that passed, do we need to vote again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Just so everybody will be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| We want the record to be completely clear as to the Council understood what was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| and did what they intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| So we had a motion, and I know it was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| To approve the zoning map as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| As amended, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| This is the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| So we have two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| That's seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Passes seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Okay, now I would like to move that we pass the text as amended, but it will include the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Include the map as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Okay, so we're voting now and or I have my light pushed to about 9B, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1550)|
| 0:25:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| 9B, but also to incorporate 9C into 9B so that we have just one ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| We had separated them into two different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Could I ask Gerald a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| So I had the chance to talk to you briefly before the meeting, before I got here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| to try and address a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| If you will look at page 13.9 part B, well section 13.9 part B, page 13.15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1587)|
| 0:26:37| this is about the floodplain, floodway discussion that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1597)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| I think, I think B there is supposed to say floodway, not floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1607)|
| 0:26:57| That's possibly true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| We can address that with the stakeholders and have an amendment before you before January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| That's a minor wording change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| I believe when we were discussing this and worked with engineering and plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| we were trying to be all encompassing in the discussion, realizing that floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| would be an incorporated floodway and would be a better descriptor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| but then we mapped only the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| So a simple wording change that can be brought to you from the stakeholders prior to January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| will address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| For, so publicly I would like to address, there is a list of changes that we have discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1650)|
| 0:27:39| that council wills for the stakeholders committee to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| I would like to say for the public and for you that I think one of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| that got brought up last week or last two weeks ago was if I get hit by a bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| and I'm the one that sat here and promised to see that change through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| how do I know it's going to get seen through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| And I realize we've all done it here as a group, but I think in the future maybe it needs to be like a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| in the form of a resolution or some official statement to the stakeholder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| here's the list of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Because I don't know that I feel some comfort that there's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| And as I started a list, there are eight things on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| I've shared it, asked for input from the law department and plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| We'll have that to the deputy to the mayor and the mayor before the end of this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| and share it with council for a resolution for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| And we'll add this item to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| So I think that will be nine items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| We have not prioritized those yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Any input from the council or the mayor's office on priorities would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Councilwoman, as well, I just wanted to bring up in the list of council-initiated revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| we've been keeping track of the items for future discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| and Mr. Green has incorporated those into that list as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| I just want to thank Mr. Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I really appreciate your comments, and you reflected a lot of how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| It's not perfect, but we have a plan to move forward, as they were just discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| and continue working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| I think right now the stalemate that we are at sort of is not productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| I think I want citizens to stay involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| because each item that comes up through the stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| is going to come through council and be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| And I think at that point it might even be easier for citizens to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| because we'll be looking at small portions instead of this huge book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| And thank you, Mr. Green, for your comments about the stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| and Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| I would like to make sure there are two things on that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| and I just want to make this, I guess, public in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| The first is, and it's just as a result of a couple of questions I've received from property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| and one from a city staff member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| ensuring that the language in the hillside provision is just clear for enforcement purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| And I don't want to open that can of worms tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| but I think the stakeholder committee, because we adopted that here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| it might be worth sending that back to the stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| just to make sure that language is really clear for the intent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| And then the second is, and I think this has probably been discussed before tonight's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| but the EN district in the zoning ordinance does have a 22,000 square foot minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1845)|
| 0:30:53| and so that will need to be addressed as the EN process is revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| And that one's on the list already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Perfect. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| High priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| I just have a quick question, and I'm going to put Mr. Ahrens on the spot, just kind of to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| You may not be able to do this off the top of your head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| but one of the comments brought forward a few minutes ago was about certain developments around Long Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| not being allowed under recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| And it is my understanding things like the Mexican restaurant there or maybe the burger place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| those were probably done with variances under our current code to make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| And I know you might not be able to pull that out off the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| Yeah, I'll have to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| If we're still discussing, I'll happily let you know this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| And I can answer a portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| The Mexican restaurant was permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| It had to go through a special review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Some of the restaurants to the east are actually in the industrial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| and I believe a broad interpretation was made that those restaurants serve the employees of the industries there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| which is a very broad interpretation, which if Mr. Ahrens was really enforcing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| I could not go to some of those restaurants because I don't work in those industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| So, in fact, the mixed-use zoning along Sutherland that is proposed would not only allow those uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| but also a number of others that we're seeing a growing interest in changing from that industrial-type use along Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| to more mixed commercial office retail while allowing some industrial-related uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| It will actually, passing this will make it more flexible with setbacks and easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Okay, contrary to what was stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Just to go back to the EN since we were clarifying that, Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| when you bring this to the stakeholders and have that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| since the Council has already voiced their opinion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| your intention, and you had said this in the meeting last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| that the intention is that all neighborhoods will be allowed to seek that status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| One of the, we'll set a process for initiating an EN study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| which will be a high bar to achieve because of the resources it takes my staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| the legal staff, Mr. Aaron's staff, and the time of Council and of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| So that will be a high bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| One of the items that, there are three items, and I'll try to remember them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| that are identified to be addressed in EN districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| Those are uses, design standards, and dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| That tells me that each EN neighborhood, proposed neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| could be slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| And now with the 22,000 square foot lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| I think we're excluding a lot of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| And as Nick said at the prior Council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| his neighborhood has 5,000 or 6,000 square foot lots as minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| But his neighborhood is established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| and I think there are a lot of other neighborhoods with varying dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| standards that are established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| We need to work on that and look forward to working with the stakeholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| committee, city and planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| and the planning commission before we come to Council with some direction on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| And so you do have some direction from Council on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| that it's going to apply to all neighborhoods, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Just wanted to make sure that was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Councilwoman Roberto, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| One of the things I wanted to say is I'm glad that the stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| is going to be going through things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| I think there are some things that got watered down along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| which I hope we're able to get back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| You know, there's the issue of property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| If somebody wants an ADU, they should have the right to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| So this is about denying somebody property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| And I wanted to make sure that it was, the rules were equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| But one of the things I forgot about was one of the reasons that we included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| ADUs in this is because that's a tool for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| So I do appreciate that there needs to be consensus in the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| and there be criteria involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| And as I stated, there will be a high bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| and we don't want to impose the majority of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| or the will of the minority on the majority of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| So we're looking for a lot of consensus in the neighborhood before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| initiate that study and then even more before any standards are put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Before we take a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| is there anybody signed up to speak on the text only or the map in particular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| No, we've heard from everyone who asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| I thought maybe someone from one of the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Mr. Kirby has already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Did you want to, you spoke on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| I thought people were speaking to both, but if you haven't spoken on the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| Did you have more you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Well, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| State your name and address again for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Danny Kirby, 6332 Bomb Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| Again, I'm not, it's pretty apparent, I'm opposed to recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| But I'm not a naysayer just to be a naysayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| When we first got involved here in the fall of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| I provided a lot of feedback to Councilman Roberto, Councilman Campin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Councilman Ryder, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| But the more I got into it, the more I started seeing these debates going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| and it occurred to me what's causing so much of the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| And it occurred to me to go back again, looking back at the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| and what the law says related to zoning changes, updates to comprehensive zoning ordinances and maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2213)|
| 0:37:01| I went back and looked at the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| The city charter specifically in 801A says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| the mayor shall have the Metropolitan Planning Commission prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| and maintain a five- and 15-year comprehensive development plan of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| to be used as a guide for the growth and development of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| In addition, the mayor shall have the Metropolitan Planning Commission prepare a one-year development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| which delineates the city's proposed land use development pattern for a succeeding 12-month period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| and is based upon the development goals and objectives specified in the city's five-year development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| The one-year development plan shall provide the basis for zoning of all properties within city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| The mayor shall submit to Council such plans that will include a 15-year, a five-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| and a one-year comprehensive development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| along with a comprehensive zoning plan of all properties within city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| The 15- and five-year plans, updated annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| shall be submitted to the Council before its second regular meeting in January of each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| After conducting public hearings on such plans, the Council shall adopt the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| after making any amendments or revisions Council considers appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| by not later than the first regular Council meeting in March of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| I've gone back and looked at the last four years of City Council meeting minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| I don't see anywhere between January and March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| where City Council was presented with a five-year or a 15-year development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| and that those were voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| So when we inquired about where these development plans were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| the response was the five- and 15-year plans are integrated into the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| and are updated as the sector plans are updated and revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| Community and corridor plans, such as the Magnolia Avenue corridor plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| further refine and update the five- and 15-year development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| Now, you all may recognize this. This is the 1930 City of Knoxville Comprehensive Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| If I understand this correctly, the City of Knoxville's five- and 15-year plans consist of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| the Central City Sector Plan, the East City Sector Plan, the North City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| the West City Sector Plan, the South City Sector Plan, Northwest City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| the Bearden Village Plan, the Broadway Central Plan, the Fort Sanders Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| the Enskip Small Area Plan, the Lonsdale Redevelopment Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| the Oakwood Lincoln Park Plan, the Vestal Site Improvement Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| the I-275 North Central Corridor Plan, the Chapman Highway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| the Cumberland Avenue Parts 1, 2, and 3 Plans, Magnolia Avenue Corridor Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| the Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Knoxville-Knox County Tree Conservation and Planning Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| the Knoxville-Knox County Parks, Recreation, and Greenways Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| and probably the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Twenty-one documents, over 1,400 pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| consist of the five- and 15-year plans for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| That's not a comprehensive plan, and they certainly haven't been updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| as required by the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Furthermore, when you look into these sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| here's what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| There are sections that call for the five- and 15-year plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| That's the East City Sectors in 2014, last updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| That's the Northwest City, last updated in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| This is the South City Sector Plan, last updated in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| This is the Central City Sector Plan's five- and 15-year plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| last updated in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| The North and the West City Sector Plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| don't even have five- and 15-year improvement plans in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| So where's the five- and 15-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| There wouldn't be all this confusion and this debate about ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| if you hadn't updated a comprehensive plan that you pointed to and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| we updated our comprehensive plan annually, and it's stated right in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| let's put ADUs in every residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| We wouldn't be having this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| So I don't know how we skipped this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| and I can't imagine that I'm smarter than anybody in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| that this was just an oversight with somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| So I'm just saying I don't believe you have an updated comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| required by the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| I don't believe you have a valid one-year plan updated by the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| and therefore I don't believe you can adopt the recode legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve the text on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| and incorporate the zoning map that was amended and just adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| Everyone clear what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| It passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| Okay, I want to, before we move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| I just want to thank everyone who's been a part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| for all of you in the audience and particularly some of the folks over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| who've been in numerous, numerous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| not just the council meetings but throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| I want to thank city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| I want to thank Gerald Green and planning staff, council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| all of the stakeholder committee, all the folks who've been involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| As I said a couple weeks ago, zoning on its face is a contentious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| If we were to put the current code that we are now implementing before the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| we would have the same kind of debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| and dialogue about what is there right now and what we have been implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| So it's all about the balancing of interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| and about preparing our community to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| to preserve that which we value and want to maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| but also to make sure that new modes of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| and opportunities are able to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| So it's been a long, hard process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| There's still a lot more work to do, as we've just discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| and staff and the stakeholders committee will be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| I just wish I'd ordered the Pride of the Southland band to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| so we could have a little celebration here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| But I do want to thank everybody for a great effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| The challenge now is to get us geared up and ready to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| and to continue to address the issues that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| As Mr. Emmons said and as Councilwoman Singh, I think others have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| there's still, you know, just like this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| the current plan's been amended over 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| this one we will continue to see better ways to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| and we will continue to work on it as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| and through a democratic process, which is what we've seen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Okay, so now we move on to resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| 11A is a resolution endorsing greenhouse gas emission reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| and respectfully requesting that the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| and the Office of Sustainability prepare a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Okay, we have some folks signed up to speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Do you want to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Okay, so we have some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| We've got Jeanette Berry, Chet Hunt, Steve Seyfried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| Did I say your name right, Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Steve here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| And Greg Polko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| Actually, I forgot to mention, as the head counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| there are four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Typically there are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| If there's no objection, I'll allow the four to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| since we didn't ask them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| Greg is speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Oh, you're Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| We only have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Okay, Ms. Berry, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| My name is Jeanette, or Jan Berry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| and I live at 140 South Cove Drive, Greenback, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And although I'm not a resident of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| I'm the state representative and coordinator for the Citizens Climate Lobby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| which has 190 members here locally, and they asked me to speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| So that's my purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| The Greater Knoxville Citizens Climate Lobby unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| and strongly supports the resolution of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| which endorses greenhouse gas emission reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| This resolution calls for reduction in municipal emissions of 50% by 2030| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| and community emissions of 80% by 2050.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| The resolution also calls for a plan with a specific strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| which would be prepared by the mayor and the Office of Sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| with input from stakeholders such as the Citizens Climate Lobby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| which is growing and already has 190 members locally, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| The city's greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts that were implemented since 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| will reduce emissions more than 20% by 2020 when compared with 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| This achievement is consistent with other major U.S. cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| that are committed to a sustainable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Advancing the city's inspirational sustainability goals to continue reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| both city and municipal greenhouse gas emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| is critical to respond to the challenge of climate change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| and is consistent with internationally recognized calls to action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| By formalizing these goals, you will be continuing the city's leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| in a nonpartisan way and earn Knoxville status among other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| that are acting to ensure a livable planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| Please commit to establishing these important targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| and commit to preparing a plan with Citizens Climate Lobby input to implement these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2794)|
| 0:46:42| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| Next we have Chet Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Mr. Hunt, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| Keep an eye on the timer up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Yes, my name is Chet Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| I live at 1548 Botsford Drive, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| I'm the chairman of the Climate Reality Project for Knoxville's chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| I'm also co-chair of Citizens Climate Lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| What I'd like to say is on behalf of the Climate Reality Project of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| I want to thank the mayor, city council, and Office of Sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| for their leadership in setting these important goals for reducing carbon emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| Passing this resolution tonight is a critical turning point in the history of our city, our beloved city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| you've probably heard that term or that acronym,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| the carbon content in our atmosphere is now at 415 parts per million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| which is dangerously high as we are rapidly depleting our carbon budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| and accelerating the unraveling of certain feedback loops, if you're familiar with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| Sometimes I feel it's like a runaway train heading straight for the station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| as we stand helpless at the boarding platform watching wide-eyed its destructive arrival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| But your policy decision here this evening gives me hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Thank you for taking these measures to protect us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| not only environmentally but also physically and economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| Tonight we are on the right side of history, and for that I am very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| Indeed, I hope the county follows your lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| Thank you for allowing me this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Our members stand ready to assist you in any way we can in achieving these objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Mr. Palco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| My name is Greg Palco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I'm here on behalf of Amoresco, an energy services company that's headquartered at 520 Summit Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| where you occupy the fourth floor of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| By way of background, Amoresco is an energy services company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| that's done extensive work with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| and with other entities in Knox County over the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| I think we were involved in one of the first energy sustainability projects that the city did about ten years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| so it's a pleasure to be here to speak on behalf of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| Amoresco is a large energy services company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| We primarily do work in the governmental sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| so we work with both municipalities, states, and the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| Our federal government is housed here in Knoxville, the division that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| and I'm the director for measurement verification there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| By way of reference, for ten years prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| I was the energy manager at ORNL before I retired at the end of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| I'm not here on behalf of ORNL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| I'll just give that as a point of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| We stand in strong support of the resolution before the council tonight as a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| Amoresco has done $800 million worth of energy services in the governmental entities that we've described earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3000)|
| 0:50:11| The point is that there's economic value associated with these kinds of targets that you establish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| and by passing these kinds of resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| it sends a clear message to the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| that the government is interested in making progress on these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| The other point that I would make is having worked with hundreds of municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| and other government entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| we've seen firsthand the importance of establishing these targets early in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| so that the goals that need to be worked toward can be measured as you move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3046)|
| 0:50:55| Although in the case of what we're describing here is carbon reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| it's important to note that you can just as easily equate that to energy consumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| or some kind of financial metric that you would care to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| We've established within the energy services community longstanding metrics around all of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| and it's easier to move forward on these kinds of activities once these kinds of goals are established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| and I applaud Ms. Gill and the work that she's done in trying to continue the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| that many of the people here in this room have worked for for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| These local goals will have significant benefits to all the people not only in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| but in the surrounding communities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| Knoxville is seen as sort of a leader in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| The local media here is shared by all the surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| and so by looking toward the leadership that Knoxville can exhibit in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| I would also believe that you would see a ripple effect throughout the other communities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| And we would ask that the City Council enthusiastically support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| and want you to know that Ameresco is certainly here and available to help in any way that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| as you all try to move forward with this and determine the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Council, I also wanted to ask Erin Gill to come up and to frame this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| I meant to do that first before the other speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| but Erin, would you please come up, our Director of Sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| and kind of frame what we're doing here and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Well, thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Erin Gill, Director of Sustainability for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| And first, Council, Mayor O'Hara proposed these goals to us earlier this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| and I really want to thank Council, the conversations that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| and the leadership that you have shown in bringing this resolution sponsored by Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| to show your support on the legislative side of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| for the goals that the O'Hara Administration has set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| They are ambitious goals, as we've heard, and I think we can applaud CERF for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| But I think we've also shown in Knoxville as a community we're up to that challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| We have so many examples when we've risen for an ambitious occasion and shown our success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| So the first, of course, example is back in 2008 when we set what seemed at the time a very lofty goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| under Mayor Haslam's administration of 20% by 2020, a big step for just 12 years, and here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| For the municipal side of that goal, we've hit it, and with our LED project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| we've not only saved millions of dollars, but we're going to surpass our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| So we've heard a lot about the successes that we've had in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| and I think that those types of ambitious, bold projects are what's going to set ourselves up for success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| as we adjust these new goals, not only from a carbon emission perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| from an economics perspective, from a good use of fiscal taxpayer dollar perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| and also just improving the quality of life for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| So just to kind of underscore that, you know, as we've heard some of our community partners say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3241)|
| 0:54:08| we should absolutely be proud of the progress we've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| and recognize that thanks to the forward-looking, pragmatic, and ultimately effective approach that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| Knoxville is not just a regional leader, but truly a national leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| and these goals continue that leadership and will help keep Knoxville in that leadership role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| not only within the state of Tennessee and the southeast, but really at the national stage as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| I also want to just emphasize that there's been a whole host of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| and partner organizations and citizens and businesses alike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| who have really not only helped us get to where we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| but also informed the development of the Office of Sustainability and the actions that we focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| They've been in the trenches with us in focus groups, in study groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| in countless meetings to help us think through what the opportunities are for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| and help us identify what makes sense to move forward with as a community and as a government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| And some of those actions, like the LED streetlight projects, are ones that touch everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| and others, like the Knoxville Extreme Energy Makeover Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| have really focused on those who are most vulnerable in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| and those are the types of projects that we'll continue to look at going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| So I personally, and I can speak for my office, Brian Blackman, I think, is still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| that we're looking forward to working alongside city council, our administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| and these many partners to plan for the long term of how we can make study progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| meaningful progress toward these goals in ways that address the needs of our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| We're looking forward to engaging in a public-facing planning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| Our website, pending your support tonight, will have a link where folks can sign up to be on a list serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| They can learn more about the planning process and stay engaged with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| whether they want to come to meetings or just provide us input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| but we look forward to having that public-facing planning approach to think through how we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| as a community, can really take those steps to achieve the new goals that we've set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| just like we've set our self-action items to achieve the ones that we set back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| So thank you for sponsoring this resolution, and I'm glad to answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| And I just want to add to that, and she alluded to this, that back in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| Mayor Haslam set ambitious goals and handed them off to me in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| and we took that challenge, and through the great work of our staff and all of our community partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3384)|
| 0:56:32| we are actually exceeding those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| And so now we all are setting goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Some of you will be here past December to continue those on and work with the new administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| but we will also set these goals, and we'll start to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| I think we're going to start on the inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| Do you want to talk about that, what we can start on right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| But in terms of the actual plans, specific plans on how those goals will be reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| we'll pass that to the next administration, but we're going to queue it up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| So just to kind of reiterate that point, the first step in any good plan is a benchmark of where you stand today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| And so for municipal operations, we know a little more clearly exactly where our numbers are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| because we track that, but we are in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| and the first stage of the planning process will be to complete our inventory of emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| for both municipality and the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| That more than likely will take us through the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| given the number of data points that we've got to gather for that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| And so our first report out to the community will be those numbers, that inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| and then that will really kick off, again, under timeline-wise, the purview of the next administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| But that will kick off really the kind of planning set to say here's where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| and then how do we get to where we want to go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| I just want to thank the administration and Office of Sustainability and the Citizens Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| I think this is a great step for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| And recently at a forum I was asked if it was ambitious enough, and I certainly think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3481)|
| 0:58:12| And, you know, serving on council and looking at achieving the current goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| I think you really realize that setting the goal is one part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| It's almost like a diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Setting the goal is sort of the easy part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| You know, the hard part is, you know, when you're hungry and the buffet line is open, you know, holding back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| And I think, you know, we have to think about the hard work ahead of us to get there in terms of fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| making our buildings energy efficient, you know, what we can do to move the needle on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| But I do think it is certainly ambitious enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| One of the things that's more challenging, it's harder to remember than 20% by 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| You know, 50% by 2030 and 80% for the whole city by 2050.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| But, you know, I am excited about it and looking forward to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| and would certainly encourage the council members that will be voting on things like updating our fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| making our buildings more energy efficient and more clean energy sources to remember this night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3548)|
| 0:59:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Director Gill, I'm going to ask you a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| But the first thing I wanted to just say is, you know, we've mentioned the word ambitious a lot in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| And I think that's because 11, 12 years ago when this was first brought up, it was pretty ambitious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| I would, you know, hazard to guess that there were probably people in the audience saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| how are you ever going to get to 20%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| Maybe you should have done something more, you know, easily reached, maybe 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| And I think the thing that we always have to think about with regard to our community is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3590)|
| 0:59:59| challenges that we face, usually we have an issue with underestimating what we can accomplish as opposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3599)|
| 1:00:08| you know, overreaching things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| So I think this is a great example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| And I know you and I have talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| But to put this into really good context, you know, there were three big areas, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3616)|
| 1:00:25| that we looked at for getting to this 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| And so I just wanted to review those with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| You know, across all utilities when we dealt with the efficiency in the buildings, I think we saw a 14% improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| In electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| And you're estimating that that saves the taxpayers how much a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| So, Councilman Roberto, thank you for your question because it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Brian does a great job tracking this on an annually basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| So I always ask him, hey, what's our savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| And he rattles off those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| So it's always good when I can then pass them along efficiently myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| But, yeah, so energy efficiency in our buildings, when you look across the entirety of our city's portfolio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| energy efficiency on a per-square-foot basis is down 14% since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| So, again, that's a testament to the work and the investments that we have made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| not only in just practical operations of our buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| but in the high-efficiency equipment that have allowed us to save quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| So when you look at all of our utilities, electricity, natural gas, water, and then that wastewater piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| which, as you know from your own bill at home, is dependent on your water usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| we are saving a million dollars a year when you factor in not only what we're using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| but in particular on the water side, the way that rates have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| Every CCF of water that we save is worth a lot of money today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| And so we're very proud to be able to have made those very practical investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| that are returning dollars back to taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| And then with regard to the efficiencies and the emissions reductions that we've seen in the fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| which when we're talking about fleet, we're talking about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Yeah, so it's correct. It's our city fleet vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| So it's the fleet pool, it's our pursuit vehicles, it's our fire trucks and our buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| And greenhouse gas emissions for those are down 11% between 2005 and 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| So, again, quite a bit of progress in a very short amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| and through very pragmatic investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| That doesn't even include the electric buses, for example, that we hope to pursue in the future with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| And the recent electric vehicles that we've added to our city fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| So when I look at the transitions that are happening and the technologies that we have available to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| there's quite a lot more progress that we can make when we think about just the turnover of our fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| and the amount of progress we've made already and quite a bit more that we have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| Well, and have you got an estimate on how much the taxpayers are saving with that level of efficiency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| I did not because the price of fuel is so variable that it ends up getting quite muddled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| Well, it's probably some savings that we're passing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Yes, and I think when you look at the – anyway, just fleet does an excellent job managing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| and so you think about the holistic approach that they've had from instituting automatic vehicle location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| where they can be more efficient at kind of utilizing the vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| making sure that folks are hopefully not unnecessarily idling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| So it's the operating of the vehicles as well as right-sizing the vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| making sure we're purchasing not an oversized vehicle for someone who really just needs a sedan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| And then, you know, really just advancing to the next generation of high-efficiency vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| with our new Leafs, the Nissan Leafs being two great examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| You've seen those out and about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| The fleet folks call them Sparky 1 and Sparky 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Well, and then we're all familiar with the LED streetlight program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| and that's a program that pays for itself in eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| and each year thereafter we're saving the taxpayers $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| So I think even if you're of the opinion that, you know, carbon isn't something to be concerned with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| you're saving more than $3 million by these efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| So I think there's something for everyone to get behind here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| So anyway, thank you very much for answering my questions and for supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| You're welcome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| I would also want to recognize Brian, as Erin did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Brian, stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| So between Brian and Erin and then all of our community partners, we've shown tremendous progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| I want to thank all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| Item 7B is a resolution congratulating Trees Knoxville for its award from the Southern Group of State Foresters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Before we vote on this, and I hope it will be a unanimous vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| I would like to ask Tom Welburn, if he is here, to come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| and any of your board that happens to be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| This is a really significant moment in the life of Trees Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| and as we heard tonight at dinner, Trees Knoxville has become quite an asset to help Knoxville in its tree efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3908)|
| 1:05:17| So we congratulate you all on this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| I'm Tom Welburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| I live at 2422 Canterbury Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| And thank you, Council and Mayor, for recognizing Trees Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| We're a very young organization, but we think we've accomplished quite a bit in a very short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3929)|
| 1:05:37| It was funny when we were talking about several of these things, including RECO, trees are the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| It's estimated that the city of Knoxville benefits just from the city trees alone over a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| a million and a half dollars in benefits associated with trees and environmental benefits, including health benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3953)|
| 1:06:01| And a lot of people don't recognize the health benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| I spent this week with the International Society of Arborists, which we're meeting here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3963)|
| 1:06:12| This moves around the country, moves around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| There's 1,100 folks here that are tree huggers just down the street here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| We watched them climb trees over the weekend, which was really exciting to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| A fellow from New Zealand won for the men and a lady from Ireland won for the women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| I didn't see any of you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| I hope some of you got to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| But it was really exciting to watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| But it was quite gratifying to hear the comments associated with Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| Several people came up because I had this shirt on saying I'm a southerner, asked me because I was one of the volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4007)|
| 1:06:55| And they were commenting on how beautiful Knoxville is and what a great city we have, especially with the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| So, again, I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| I hope you all will support Trees Knoxville in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| I have had some of you out planting trees before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| and Councilman Saunders has actually supported some of our planting efforts with funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| But we certainly appreciate all that the city council and the mayor have done to support Trees Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| Well, this is a really significant moment for you all to be recognized by the southern group of state foresters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| for your help in creating the canopy that exists out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| And later in the agenda, we have a resolution to plant some more trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Excuse me, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| Can we just give them a round of applause for all their work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4071)|
| 1:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| to provide funding for the community schools initiative in an amount not to exceed $425,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| I will not be voting on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| I think everyone on council knows that I'm the president of Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| These funds have been awarded to the organization far before I served on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| So I do want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| And the dollars go directly to support our community schools strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| So one of my colleagues from Great Schools Partnership is here to speak about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| But I will not be voting on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| We have funded community schools for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Prior to you being councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Would you like to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Ball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Ms. Ball, come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Chair Ball, come on down and tell us a little about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| I rarely will pass up an opportunity to talk about community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| First of all, I just want to thank council and Mayor Harrow for supporting the strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| And under your tenure in particular, we have gone from one school to 15 throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| And that includes serving about a little over 6,500 students in 12 elementary schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4167)|
| 1:09:35| three middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| We added three new community schools last year, which was big, a lot for us to be adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| all in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| But we did it and we were really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| And through our process, we've done a lot of making sure that every single school is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4188)|
| 1:09:56| individualized, but they have the opportunity to do, so that they have the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| do what needs to be done for that community and that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| Because every school is just a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| One of the things that I left as a handout for you today is this sheet that says our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| philosophical approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| And I will not be reading this sheet to you, but I did want to draw your attention particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| to the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| The purpose of Great Schools Partnerships Community School Strategy is to convene community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| resources by utilizing the school as the hub in order to remove barriers to student learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| and to promote healthy, vibrant communities, families, and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| This is a really key tenant for us related to the community school strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| And there's all kinds of fabulous information on this sheet for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| The other sheet that I provided includes highlights from the previous school year, not this most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| recent school year, but the 17-18 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| We don't have all of our data in hand just yet for this most recent school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| A few highlights from the 18-19 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| 227 students received mental health services from our partner Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| 2,744 students received dental screening last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4271)|
| 1:11:19| And the shocking number for me with that is that 712 students had direct treatment through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| our partnership with Eldridge Children's Foundation's dental program, the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| Health Department, and, of course, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| So that's a lot of kids that are happier with their mouth during the day so that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| be focused on school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| The Cal Johnson Rec Center has been undergoing some renovations, and we were able to partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| with the Parks and Rec team to be able to have community, to have their summer programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| at one of our community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| So at Green Magnet Academy, there was all summer long programming that, for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| that normally are at the Cal Johnson Rec Center, they were able to, we were able to coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| that at Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| We had, of the 15 schools in the city, 12 of them had summer programming going on, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| included everything from Girls Inc. to the Freedom School, summer reading, English as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4335)|
| 1:12:21| a second language, Boys and Girls Club, the Y, Kumba Camp, Shakespeare in Shades, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| list goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| I'm going to stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| But our community is so giving and really, really talented and has a lot of expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4350)|
| 1:12:38| This strategy, as I mentioned with the purpose, is about convening community resources, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| reinventing community resources, but using the ones that already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| We have about 240 partners from all over the Knoxville community supporting this strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| It includes faith-based organizations, youth serving groups, businesses, community clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| and associations of all types, as well as just individuals who are supporting our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| All these groups and individuals are coming together to help the community school strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| make a direct difference in the lives of students, families, schools, and our neighborhood community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| If you have any questions, I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Ms. Ball, I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| So, currently, I think formerly there were 13 great schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| Now we have 16 in the Great Schools Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Great Schools Partnership does have 16 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| One of those schools, New Hopewell Elementary, is located in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| It is not within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| Okay, so 15 of them are in the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Yes, so the funding goes to Fund 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Are there plans or possibilities of additional in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| Yes, give us more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Opportunities are endless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Hold on, magic wand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| We absolutely very much want to expand the community school strategy, and the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| district has expressed interest in that with us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| We are taking a year to balance and systemize and make sure that we're prepared for sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4451)|
| 1:14:18| growth, but we absolutely hope to be coming back to you with opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| So there's a short list and long list of potential growth opportunities to make more impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| We work with the school district on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| And I just would like to say, I have experience with both Beaumont and Vine, having children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| at both of those schools, and the staff at Great Schools Partnership that are there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| I've worked with have been fantastic, and really appreciate what they do there, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| I feel like the importance is that they're focusing on root cause issues that keep children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| from focusing on their learning, and so it's a really important role that we're fulfilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Community schools is a very effective strategy, so we're very pleased to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4511)|

| 1:16:18| Would you mind talking about what you do, especially the mixed income model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| I love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4580)|
| 1:16:35| Daniel Watson with the Restoration House, thrilled to be back before you again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| I'm so honored, Mayor and City Council members, for the opportunity to expand affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| I'll tell you, this project, located in the western side of the city, has been such a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| dream of our family, but also our board, who some of us is with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| I'm thrilled to announce that over the 24 units that we've constructed there, 86 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| of that has been publicly funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| So I love that we're able to marry some of these private dollars, that we're able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| marry some of these public funding with the private dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| I think what Councilwoman Singh-Perez wants me to mention is that this is housing in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| of shelter, but it's so much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| This is a community of people living out kind of counter-culturally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| This is a community, including my home, which is on an adjacent parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| We have 28 total homes after this project is complete, six of which are for mixed income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| families, and the other 22 are for low income single parent families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| And the reason we're doing it is we just think it's healthier to live in a mixed community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| You know, the root word of community is common, and we need to spend way more of our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| finding out what we have in common with one another, instead of casting barriers for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| separates us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| And over the next 10 years, this community will impact over 150 single parent families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| in our community, over 300 children, and in addition to that, these families are changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| the trajectory of their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| I mean, they're going to school to be nurses, psychiatrists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| We had a young woman who graduated with her master's degree and now has a marriage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| family therapy practice in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| We're partnering with Emerald Youth Foundation and implementing their Just Lead model, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| more than that, we're partnering with them to layer a trauma-responsive approach across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| that, so we can shift the paradigm for these young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| And more than any of that, my family gets to live there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| And so this, for us, is not about a nine and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| It's about living in such a way where all of us get to experience restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| So, we're so thankful for the opportunity to complete this project this year through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| these funds and some additional funding that we got through THDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| And we look forward to moving on to new projects as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| One of the things our organization is considering is on a site adjacent to it is actually building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| a trauma-informed, trauma-responsive child development center for preschoolers that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| be also mixed income, that would support our families, but also the neighborhood kids as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| So, if you've not been by, I'd love to invite you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| I will tell you, one of the greatest compliments I ever received is when people just happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| to pass by and they come into the office to buy a condo there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| You know, this is not what people think of when they think of low-income, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| This is a place that any of you all, and I know myself, am proud to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| So, thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190813?start=4768)|
