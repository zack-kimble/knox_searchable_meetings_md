| 0:00:31| Salute, pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=33)|
| 0:00:39| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=39)|
| 0:00:42| one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=44)|
| 0:00:53| Thank you all so much for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=53)|
| 0:00:55| and we appreciate your patience and cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| as we continue to follow current health guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| I wanted to just kind of remind everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| why we're meeting here in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| rather than across the street in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| We moved over to this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| because the court proceedings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| were happening in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| So we moved here so that we could allow that to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| without disrupting that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| and we also had to consider the AV equipment issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=93)|
| 0:01:41| So our team has worked very hard to get this room set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| so that we could have the meeting from this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| It is not an option for them to go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| So it is quite possible that we will be meeting in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| until probably our September meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| because they will be having court in the main assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| until August 11th, I believe, is the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| We have a meeting on August 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| I don't know that it's a good idea to ask our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| to have one day to make sure everything works properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| so I think we'll probably move back over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| the first meeting that we have in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| for that work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| So I'm thankful that we have a space here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| and there's a lot of public just sitting in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| that we have enough room for that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| and so the public still continues to be welcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| and we will continue to just ask folks to wear masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| or face coverings when you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| and public forum is happening just as our policy states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| so really the only thing that is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| is just our location change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| and so we'll be here until September, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Things are subject to change, but that's today's thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| I wanted to announce that the Joint Education Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| will meet on Wednesday, July 22nd at 4 p.m. in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=183)|

| 0:06:45| I know our students, families, employees have many questions about topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| including social distancing, masks, our virtual learning option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=408)|

| 0:06:59| and what happens if a member of our school community, students, teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| community tests positive for COVID-19, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=423)|

| 0:07:39| We will also be using our social media feeds, particularly Twitter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| and Facebook, to raise awareness and answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| As I have said before, our hope is to return to an in-person school setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| this fall if we can do so while reasonably protecting the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| and safety of our students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| At the same time, we will provide a virtual option for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| who are not comfortable returning to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| There will be many challenges, and I acknowledge up front the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| may not work perfectly on day one, so please be patient with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=486)|

| 0:08:17| are working extremely hard to make sure the work of teaching and learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| goes full speed ahead this fall while also protecting the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| and safety of our students, staff, and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Over the next few weeks, you'll be seeing the hashtag KCSTogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| in many of our communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| We're hoping that hashtag serves as a reminder that the work of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| is a shared mission, particularly during these historic times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| when we need every member of the KCS community to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| and join us in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| I know the people in our community are resilient, resourceful, and compassionate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| and those traits will serve us well as we tackle this new challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| I'm very honored to serve as your superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| and I look forward to the opportunities ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| So, Madam Chair, members of the Board, this concludes my report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| And now we will refer to our reopening task force report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| And Mr. Geriascu, come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| and we are ready to hear your findings from the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you, Madam Chair, Mr. Superintendent, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| in this very, very important endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| I will be brief as I summarize our deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| First, let me thank our task force members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Reverend Sam Brown from the 1st District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Dr. Joan Grimm from the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Ms. Melanie Craig from the 3rd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Mr. Jonathan Fortner from the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Ms. Susie Carr from the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Ms. Michelle Pickler from the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Mr. Rob Cummings from the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Mr. Steve Hundley from the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| and Mr. Brandon Gillenwater from the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Some of them may be here, some outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| I hope you'll thank them for their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| As you know, Knox County Schools sent out a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| to approximately 77,000 parents, students, teachers, and administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| and conducted focus groups with those same stakeholder groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| plus one group of children and youth-serving partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Approximately 30,000 surveys were completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| 82% of which were completed by parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| This is a testimony to the gravity of the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| that you will have to make in the coming days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| The majority of parents, students, and teachers responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| preferred that schools reopen with classes taking place in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| as long as appropriate safety measures could be put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| Slightly less than half of administrators who responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| preferred that classes take place in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| and I think this is indicative of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| that the school administrators are going to be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| for creating safe environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| and so they certainly don't disagree with the preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| A significant minority, ranging from 31% to 41%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| preferred a hybrid model with in-person and some online classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| And a small group of respondents, ranging from 11% to 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| preferred all online classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Our task force's job was not to come up with a series of recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| related to the opening of school this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| That responsibility falls to the superintendent and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Rather, we were asked to respond to the survey and focus group results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| offering any insights, observations, or questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| that might assist the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| as he formulates his recommendations to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| Task force discussions took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| over the course of four hours on June 24 and 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| Of course, task force members also spent countless hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| fielding questions from parents, teachers, and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| listening to their opinions and doing their own research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| As you would expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| each member's response to the data presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| was informed by the questions, recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| and concerns expressed by the citizens living in our respective districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| as well as our own personal and professional perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| So, on behalf of the task force, I respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| and I really do mean that, I don't just say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| I can't imagine the weight of the decisions you're having to make soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| So, when I say respectfully, I really mean it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| I respectfully offer the following observations and insights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| In our view, there is no substitute for in-person, in-class teaching and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| The relationships between students and their teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| and among students themselves are central to the learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| We all want our children back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Having said that, the system must place a priority on student and staff safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| ensuring that they will be able to learn and teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| in the healthiest environment possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| while at the same time accomplishing the educational outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| that will prepare our students for their futures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| This will entail more than anything else a balancing of risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| and acknowledging that there are no risk-free options available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| I want to say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| This will entail more than anything else balancing risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| and acknowledging that there are no risk-free options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| In making this observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| we also acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits-all way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| of addressing safety concerns throughout our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| A host of factors will require that each school create its own plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| to accomplish system-wide learning and safety goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| The hard lesson of this pandemic, which we are slowly learning as a culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| is that while we all want to return to something approximating normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| the COVID-19 virus is opportunistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| and frankly really doesn't care what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| Therefore, decisions related to the form of reopening the Board adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| should be based on science and data to the greatest degree possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| The risks associated with COVID-19 differ with differing age groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| from toddlers to senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| According to the journal Pediatrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| children are the least likely to become infected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| spread the disease, or suffer severe symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| While the physical health of our students and their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| is top of mind for us all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| we must acknowledge that there are also significant psychosocial health risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| associated with remote learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| Likewise, when developing strategies for creating safe in-person environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| we must make certain that we have age-appropriate expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| For example, it is highly unlikely that our youngest students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| will be able to wear masks all day or practice social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| So in developing our plans, we must be able to answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| What steps will we take to mitigate the risks that occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| when safety protocols designed primarily for adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| are just not practically feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| We are blessed in Knox County to have an excellent health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| and we all hope that the school system will continue to work hand-in-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| with Dr. Buchanan and her colleagues as we plan our return to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| This will be especially critical as the system devises public health benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| to determine the form initial school opening will take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| and the potential changes in delivery systems as we move into colder months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| Given the dynamic nature of the public health crisis we are facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| the system must develop multiple plans for multiple contingencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| all focused on guaranteeing uninterrupted teaching and learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| regardless of the status of the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| or the changes in any given student's circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| Our students lost valuable learning time last semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| when we were forced to close our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| and we must do all we can to avoid a repeat of that situation in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| The task force says this, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| acknowledging that there is a gargantuan task ahead of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| as 60,000 students create 60,000 individual situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| Issues of equity across the system must be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| If future circumstances dictate that online learning is the only option for a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| or if a hybrid model of reopening is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| access to broadband service must be in place for all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| assuring this will require extraordinary steps prior to schools opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| and may involve unprecedented cooperation among sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| If broadband cannot be made universally available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| we must find ways to serve those children without it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| rather than shutting down the whole system for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| If remote learning becomes necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| care must be given to developing strategies to address the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| of our most vulnerable populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| including those who are medically fragile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| have developmental challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| have special health care needs or disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| or are English language learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| Of all the conversations I've had with parents, and there have been many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| those related to students with special needs have been the most fraught with anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1090)|
| 0:18:18| If at any time online learning becomes a necessity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| it is imperative that teachers have the skills and the technical support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| necessary to carry out their responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| In the weeks remaining before school opens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| teachers must be given the opportunity, the resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| and the encouragement to develop these skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| On a related matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| we must acknowledge that the pedagogy for in-person and online teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| is dramatically different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| creating extraordinary burdens on teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| if they are expected to manage students both in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| and at home simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| Detailed plans should be developed related to what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| if a student, teacher, or staff member becomes infected with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| or is exposed to the COVID-19 virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| In fact, developing a plan for dealing with a student or staff member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| who has actually contracted the disease may be easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| than doing so for a student or staff member who has only been exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| Plans must be put into place to address those parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| who simply do not feel safe sending their children to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| but who may later change their minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| based on changes in the status of the disease and its spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| This will require a review of policies related to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| and when students are allowed to move back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| from remote to in-person learning environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| While it is seemingly impossible to achieve desired social distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| on our school buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| plans need to be developed to mitigate the spread of the virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| while children are being transported to and from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| We must make certain that our partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| such as after-school child care providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| and others who will be expected to provide services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| if children cannot be in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| are provided a place at the table as plans are being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| We hear a lot about the need to reopen our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| The truth is that our parents will not be able to return to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| if they don't have a safe place to leave their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| and our children and youth-serving organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| will play a key role along with the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| in ensuring that our educational and economic goals are accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| In particular, we will need to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| how we will prepare these partners to support our online efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| in those instances where parents must go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| leaving their kids in a child care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| While reopening the economy cannot be the school's primary concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| we do need to acknowledge that both online and hybrid models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| place a special burden both on parents who work outside the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| particularly single parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| and on the child care and youth-serving organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| that parents will depend upon if they must go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| And finally, if you don't hear anything else from the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| I hope you will hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Communicate, communicate, communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| and then when you're finished communicating, keep communicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| With our parents, our teachers, and myriad other stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| there is nothing more important, nothing more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| to our parents, our teachers, and our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| than the well-being of our kids, and ambiguity is the enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| In my own doctoral research 40 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| data revealed that in challenging circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| ambiguity is the single greatest source of stress for all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| People can handle almost anything if they know it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| But never doubt that nature abhors a vacuum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| and in the absence of good information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| misinformation, rumor, and innuendo will fill the void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| We fear that some of this is happening already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| We need to let our stakeholders know our plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| with the greatest level of detail possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| using any means of communication possible and as often as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| This is a big task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| but I think even when we can't give them definitive answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| letting them know what we're working on is also helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| The task force is pleased to note that not a single item I've covered tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| represents a surprise to our superintendent or to our administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| and I'm pleased to say that they are already at work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| on every single one of these items and have been for a good long while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| But time is of the essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| and now we must let parents and teachers know the status of our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| In closing, allow me to say that we acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| that opening school under these extraordinary circumstances will be expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| and we know there is no such thing as a blank check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| especially in times like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| Nevertheless, we all hope that cost will not be the primary force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| in any substantive decision that you will make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| One of many considerations to be sure, but never the primary criterion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| That distinction belongs to those criteria that drive our children's intellectual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| physical, and psychosocial well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| On behalf of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| I thank you for the opportunity to participate in this most important effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| Thank you so much, Dr. Askew, for facilitating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| and we appreciate, thank you so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| we appreciate all of the task force members taking time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| and I'm sure they did spend countless hours talking to their community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| so thank you all for that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| And, you know, this is, I think as he mentioned in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| the superintendent has met with several focus groups, parents, teachers, principals, students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| and so this is another layer of information that he will take to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| and Mr. Superintendent, did you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Oh, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Jerry, you did an excellent job of chairing the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| and I couldn't be more pleased at the work that you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| and also the members of the task force that served with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| I thank our board members for recommending a community member to serve on the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| and you did an incredible amount of work in a short period of time, two meetings, wow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| and come back with, you know, the information that you came back with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| So just on behalf of the staff and all, just thank you so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| and as Madam Chair indicated, one source of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| also we had our research department met with focus groups, students, parents, teachers, principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| also conducted separate meetings with our focus groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| and appreciate all the people that participated in our focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| and then the survey, you know, had 30,000 responses to the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| was tremendous, and I think, and I believe I'm right on this number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| I believe on the number of families that expressed an interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| maybe it's, I think it's over 11,000 families that expressed an interest in online learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| or virtual or remote learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| So, again, pretty incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| I know staff's done a lot of work there, and we certainly heard communicate, communicate, communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| and we plan to do more of that as well when we get this information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| So, and I know board members have had lots of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| and thank you so much for your patience, too, while we work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| We want to get it right, and I know it's taken time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| and as I said earlier, day one may not be, may not look just smooth as clockwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| but I think we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| So appreciate everyone's patience in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| I heard one superintendent ask for grace, so that seemed like a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| so I'm going to ask for grace, too, as we move through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| So couldn't thank you more, so thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you, Mr. Superintendent, and thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Okay, and we will now move to our discussion of our regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| Just as a reminder, be sure to pull your mic down if you need to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| and also I wanted to note for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| that we received the final information regarding the CARES Act ESSER grant funding this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| and that has been added as Item 8F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Okay, and so with that, we'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Do we have questions on Item C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1617)|
| 0:27:07| Okay, Item Contracts 1 or 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1627)|
| 0:27:17| Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| I'm not really sure who to address this of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| but there are kind of several of these about sort of our partnerships with groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| that normally come into our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| and I'm just wondering how we're possibly addressing that with everything else that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| or is that going to be something that will come about later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Because it seems like there were several items that kind of dealt with some of these student-teacher type people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| or nurses in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| And these partnerships, Scott can provide a little bit more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| So, Scott, you would approach the mic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| but these will be things we're entering into, obviously, for this coming fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| So a couple things that you'll look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| The first one you'll see is a primary partnership agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| A primary partnership agreement is going to be a little different than a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| We're hosting maybe a practicum student for a university or what we would call an EPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1686)|
| 0:28:15| So the primary partnership agreement is something where we actually take ownership in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| We help direct the instruction for those programs that are teaching our future teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| And so you'll see that with LMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Our primary partnerships are limited to just UTK, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, LMU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| and Johnson University primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Those are our three primary partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| You will see King University and that Northern Colorado University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| and they will provide us with student teachers from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| The King University, that's a local university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| and so one of the things that we talk about with that is you'll see that being a three-year term with a two-year renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| When we're dealing with more broad universities like, for example, the Northern Colorado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| which is an online university, they are embedding a student teacher with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| With those, we say basically a one-year contract with the option to renew it from year after year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| for a school that's more distant than our local partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| To address the question that you're talking about with the additional folks that are coming in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| we see these folks as kind of mission essential folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| These are going to be the teachers that are going to fill our vacancies in the next coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| So if we neglect those, then we're going to be in a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| We're going to have an issue if we don't allow them in our schools to do what they're required to do to become licensed educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1782)|
| 0:29:51| And so we do have measures in place like we do, like we will with teachers and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| But I hope that addresses your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Yes, I think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| I think just along with all of the parents for our K through 12 kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| I've heard I have friends that have kids that are in the teaching programs too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| and they have the same concerns along with all the college kids about obviously this is the next step in their kids getting to do their career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| and so them hoping that they were going to be allowed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| So it sounds like we are, if all goes well, planning on letting these student teacher people see the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Thank you, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Questions on three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| I think he's addressed three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Any other questions on three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1839)|

| 0:30:47| Seven or eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| Nine or ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| Eleven or twelve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| And then moving to board policies, we have one policy, D-110, the annual operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| Any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| It's really just changes to our current practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| Grants, questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1881)|

| 0:31:47| Ms. Patterson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| I don't know if the construction company is here or somebody from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| Oh, hey, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| I'm doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Congratulations on winning the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I just kind of want to have a converse or just kind of put it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| the expectation that I have as we move forward with this construction of Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| and also the expectation from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| and just kind of talk a little bit what your plans might be with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| And so in the contract it says part of it is that the contract shall make all reasonable efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| to engage diverse business enterprise as subcontractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| So what are your plans to incorporate minority subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| or to make sure that that community is benefiting from the $19 million we're about to spend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| And also, are there any plans to ensure the community voice is heard in the development of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| so that they can have full ownership of their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| Okay, I'm going to address the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Basically, I'm with John Townsend with Rouse Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| And what we'll probably do with the solicitation of the bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| we have a set known quantity of subcontractors that we normally use in our daily business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1989)|
| 0:33:19| developed that over 40 some odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| And we also will put this solicitation out on Builders Exchange, PlanHub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2002)|
| 0:33:31| We have our own internal email system that we send out these information to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| On top of that, we will probably utilize any known vendors, subcontractors that Mr. Myers has available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2019)|
| 0:33:49| And we're willing to entertain anybody that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| So we'll throw a net out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| We'll cast it out pretty far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| I think on top of that, we also, just to throw this out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| we attended a diversity expo that was through Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| And we gained a few names through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Not a whole lot, but it was worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| And the question with ensuring that the development or the process itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| that the community is included throughout the beginning to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Do we want to have somebody from the school system answer that or Mr. Oates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2066)|
| 0:34:39| Our intent, and we've had some discussions with the city as well on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| that they are another partner in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| Our intent is that once there is an initial design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| is to take that back to the community and let them take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| and make whatever comments they want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| And then if we can adapt those or work those within the constraints that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| that we would include that in the process and then bring that final design back to the board for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| I just want to say that I'm grateful that we were able to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| We handled it well on the board side, and as we pass it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| we want to make sure that we continue to handle it well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| and that the voices are heard in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| So that's all I ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Any other questions on that item or item H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Moving to regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Any questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| Any questions on B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| I don't know who to ask this about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| The word imminent domain is kind of an interesting phrase to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| I just wanted to hear some description of what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| Mr. Hopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| I'll start, and then I'll let the law director dig me out of the ditch when I run into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| The entity that holds the property that we're looking at has not stayed current with the state on their particular charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2185)|
| 0:36:35| and they've not stayed current with local government either on their property tax payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| So there are some issues that they have to overcome in order to be able to sell property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2202)|
| 0:36:51| and what it will really require is an action of the court in order to clear up those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| So doing a friendly imminent domain action will get that ball rolling with the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| and will help clear that up and then let us purchase the property from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| So this is imminent domain, but it's a friendly imminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| It's not something that we're forcing on someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| It's just an action that we need to take in order to complete the court requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| Is that correct, Mr. Duggan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Mr. Duggan, would you like to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| I think he's going to correct you on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| No, what Mr. Oaks is saying is essentially correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| You know, I know Mr. Oaks and several folks with the school system reached out to the swim club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2260)|
| 0:37:47| as I'll refer to them, and, you know, we would love to have an agreement, an MOA, MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| whatever you want to call it, with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| But unfortunately that's just not possible because technically they no longer exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| according to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| I mean, you have to file certain documents to stay effective as a corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| whether it's nonprofit or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| And so I don't want to go into great detail on that, but the bottom line is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| we're just not able to enter into an agreement with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Now, you know, imminent domain, I know it's a dirty word to some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| I mean, it's an action for some government entity to come in and take land that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| Obviously, in this case, it's the only option to be able to get land that's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| for the remodeling of Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| And the swim club folks have been made well aware of the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| and whatever money is paid, and there will be some reasonable money paid for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2335)|
| 0:39:04| that will be paid into court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| And then, you know, it will be held for the swim club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| for them to hopefully get their organization in order and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| get right with the state, so to speak, and then be able to acquire the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| and do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Nothing has been done in an underhanded fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| And, again, this was really the only option we felt like we had to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| So I do like Mr. Oaks' characterization of a friendly imminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| although that's rare, but it's applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| I've never heard of it, but I'm glad you used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| I did have a couple other questions maybe here for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| So it's a community pool organization, and it's still functioning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| It's functioning as an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| but it is not an organization recognized by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| Okay, but the pool is still functioning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| They get swim teams or people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| I don't know, you know, what the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Okay, but people are coming and getting in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| That's my understanding, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| But let me lay this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| We're not buying the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| The pool, there are three basically pieces of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| There's the pool property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| and then there's a piece of property that's basically vacant except for a tennis court that's disused on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2434)|
| 0:40:43| And then there is an open piece of property that they own that is basically under a power cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| And it's the latter two pieces of property that we're looking to pick up from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| to help us with our back drive for the new school that we're designing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| So it's not property that they're particularly using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| or even property that might be usable for further development because of the location of the power cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| I was just going to answer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| I was out at the pool two days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| It's open and functioning, but that is not part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| They just wanted to retain the pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| and were willing to give, well, not give, but sell the other part to the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Okay, and the last item is our board annual calendar for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| You'll notice that it follows our typical pattern to allow the first Wednesday as work sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2502)|
| 0:41:51| and the second Wednesday of each month at 5 p.m. in the main assembly room for our regular session meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2511)|
| 0:42:02| A couple of the dates have shifted around to accommodate school being out and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| We do have quarterly workshops on here, and also we, let's see, the April 28th meeting will be our annual budget meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2529)|
| 0:42:22| where we'll approve the budget, and that will be held in lieu of the April quarterly workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| And I've left on the, I asked Ms. Coatney to leave on the two-day annual fall retreat for September 23rd and 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2547)|
| 0:42:37| and we talked about should we split that up and do a day in the fall and a day in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| Since we have new board members who will be joining the board as we reorganize in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| we felt like it was probably better to leave it as a two-day retreat because I remember as a new board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| that was really a very important time because we are able to gain so much information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| So I felt like it was important to leave it as a two-day retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| We can, and the other thing about that, when we get into the spring, we're already doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| the staff is very busy with the budget cycle, and we have all of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| So we want to make sure that the budget is being focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| We can always add a work session if we need one, but I felt like it was probably better just to go ahead and leave that two-day workshop for the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2601)|
| 0:43:31| So does anybody have any feedback or question on the calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| I just was looking at July because I messed myself up this July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| but I was noticing and I might point out to everybody that we have the work session actually in June right before the 4th next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| and then we're skipping that week because the 4th will be on Sunday next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| So just everybody might want to make their aware so they don't make vacation plans erroneously like I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| Yes, thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| And there may be another place on the calendar where there's a work session two weeks before the regular session because of school being out or a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2642)|
| 0:44:11| So just be sure and note that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you, and that concludes the discussion of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| So Ms. Babb, we'll go to public forum now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2658)|
| 0:44:26| Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Tanya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Thank you, Madam Chair and board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| I am Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I am the president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| But it gives me great pleasure today to stand here in the stead of over 5,500 educators across Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2686)|
| 0:44:54| and express the heartfelt need to have a well-grounded, steadfast leader as Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2694)|
| 0:45:03| It has been at least well over 10 years that we, the Knox County Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| Knox County school system has had an educator who has a heart and where he has served for the educators as Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2707)|
| 0:45:18| Just a little bit over two and a half weeks ago, the educators were proud to know that he could hold his own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| and yet continue to foster positive relationships across this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| When he set his strategic goals to eliminate disparities, increase student achievement, and create a positive culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| he did just that and then some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| In regards to his contract, you couldn't have extended his contract or given it to a more deserving individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2743)|
| 0:45:53| In regards to reopening schools, I believe Dr. Askew, I'm going to step over because he used to be my name, snuck into my speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2753)|
| 0:46:04| because I said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I had to sit and edit it and say, communicate, communicate, communicate, and be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2766)|
| 0:46:15| It doesn't matter what the choice is or as long as one is being communicated to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2775)|
| 0:46:24| I know that the superintendent may believe that he's listening to some deja vu right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| Pointing fingers never helps any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| Nevertheless, Dr. Askew, however, did not touch on the many educators that have been in contact with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2793)|
| 0:46:41| the Knox County Education Association, the sole partner in representing the educators in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| as it relates to the Professional Educators Collaborative Conferencing Act, which you have gone into agreement with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| When we call on the superintendent, he answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2814)|
| 0:47:02| Now, we might not agree on everything because, as you know, everything is not agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2822)|
| 0:47:13| But he also gives us the opportunity to express concerns that educators are continuously worrying about the safety of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2833)|
| 0:47:23| their families, the communities in which they teach, and themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| All I can say for you as the board, you got you a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| And I want to thank you, Mr. Thomas, for taking the time to listen to us when we do call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| But also know that educators are worried senseless without the communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| It will be impeccable for us to do that, as we cannot wait any longer until July 15th comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| And we'll move to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| We'll start with Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| I just would like to say that I know a lot of people are watching tonight and may be disappointed that more issues were not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2891)|
| 0:48:22| And I hope everyone heard our superintendent when he made it very clear that we would have a full plan next Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2902)|
| 0:48:31| I know the waiting is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| But please, please know that as soon as one issue is addressed, it creates two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2914)|
| 0:48:44| Or 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Or 15, yeah, which is exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| I know what our leadership team has encountered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| And so it literally, it's like the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| It continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Again, I appreciate the patience of teachers and parents and kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| I know it has been hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| Please, please just hang a little longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| And I promise you, I promise you that a good plan will be put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| Ms. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| I'd like to say thank you also to Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Appreciate that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| I know that can be a bear to get people together and have all these different voices come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| And your statement about communication being the key, absolutely it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| And as this rolls forward, those communicative steps will be important to get people to come on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2984)|
| 0:49:54| And so I hope that your task force also will realize the need to be, to have continuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| and to give support to the system as it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| It will be complex, but it will be very helpful to have them on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| and be positive about whatever takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| And I know people are very anxious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| And as Ms. Hill pointed out, when you ask one question, it truly opens up 10 or 15 more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| So these are very complex issues that the school system is dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| And so I know everybody's anxious to know everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| And so they are working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| And please just be patient just a little while longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| My hope is that because they've not rushed to determine everything that's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3048)|
| 0:50:56| they're very thoughtfully going through this process, that hopefully it will be a little bit smoother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| We know that it's going to be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| It's going to be challenging because it's completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| But at least hopefully we'll have better processes in place because they've taken care to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| So with that, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200708?start=3075)|
