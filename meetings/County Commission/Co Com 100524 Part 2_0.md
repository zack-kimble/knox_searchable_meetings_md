| 0:02:01| Property located southeast side of Wallace Road, northwest of South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| This is in the 4th Commission District, 4-G-10-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:15| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Mr. Chairman, actually, I believe there's been a change on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| I don't see Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| He's over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Oh, back there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| I know the applicant went back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| I had a conversation with the applicant last week, and I had a concern about water runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=154)|
| 0:02:45| and the slope development, and there's been a slight change, as I understand it, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| Yes, Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| We met with the applicant during this past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| and reviewed some of the studies that he's done on the site since the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| As you know, we base staff recommendations on the slope analysis that we do from the GIS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=189)|
| 0:03:19| sometimes on some properties that can be relatively crude and requires a second look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| As it turns out, the slope that shows up on all of the topographic maps that we have available to us now was man-made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:34| and it was created by the property owner building or creating a building site on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| which created a cut-and-fill situation, and our maps were picking that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| As a result, staff's recommendation was, I believe, at two units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| The applicant had asked for four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| The Planning Commission compromised at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| Obviously, the Planning Commission was influenced by the staff recommendation to a certain degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| so there probably is a rationale for granting greater density on this based on the fact that the slopes on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=250)|
| 0:04:19| appear to be man-made rather than natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| There is a creek along one edge of the property that we want to make sure that we preserve an adequate buffer for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=262)|
| 0:04:30| and there are some significant trees along that creek that we would like to protect as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| but I think we can do that at a density greater than the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| As I understand it, the density now would be, what, 3.7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| And it would be, there would be significant open space and that the tree line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| and that slope maintained as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| That will be the plan that we will work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| If you would, please identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| I'm Benny Mormon, President of Benchmark Associates, 10308 Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| and that will be the concept and use on review plan that we submit to MPC will reflect those preservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=306)|
| 0:05:18| Understanding that change, then I would move that we accept the recommendation from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| Senator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| If I may, the Planning Commission recommended at three units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| The applicant is now requesting 3.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| We, as staff, are comfortable with that based on the new information that we have regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| That's why I called Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| I thought this thing might have to go back to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| The Commission considered four and two and everything in between, so I'm still comfortable with 3.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:57| Senator Saunders, we have one opposition guy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| Who was the guy that held his hand up for opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Were you opposing the new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=367)|
| 0:06:20| I need your name and address for the record, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| I live 1312 Wallace Road on the right side of the property, looking at it from the street, Wallace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=384)|
| 0:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| The property is 3.04 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| The whole left side is down in a hole, which means if you give them 3.7 or whatever per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:44| most of those houses are going to be right on my line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| I'm going to be going from one house 100 foot off my line to a bunch of houses stacked up right on my property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| because my property line is 351 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| And I just don't see how you could put that many houses on less than three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=419)|
| 0:07:08| I'd like to see the drawings on it to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| How many total houses are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Total units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| Eleven units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| You don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Do you have any more to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| What I'm saying is there's not a full three acres there that's usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| There's drainage on the back and there's drainage on the left side, a big drainage area on the left side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| Down in the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| The frontage on it is, I think, 302 foot frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| But from the driveway over to the left, it's really in a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=473)|
| 0:08:02| I just don't see how you can get that many houses in there without stacking them all up on my side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| How much of this 3.4 acres is buildable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| I'm asking what percentage of it is buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| I'm looking at close to a third of it is not usable as building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| It's down in a hole and some on the back also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| MPC, can you answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| I don't think anybody should vote for it unless they go and look at the property, look at how it lays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:42| We haven't done calculations as far as comparing the area that would be preserved to the area that would be built upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| But there would be a sizable stream buffer along the north edge of the property, which is the lowest piece of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:59| That might be a fifth of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| That's just a guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| But we haven't done that analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| We will when we get a use-on-review development plan that comes through for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:20| The gentleman that came up and spoke there, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| I have a question for Mr. Price first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| He's already given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| I want his name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| What's your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=576)|
| 0:09:36| Chairman Moorman, 10308 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| What do you have a question for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Mr. Price, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| You know that before this can go through, they have to come back with another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| Once they get their development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| that will be the time when we need to take another look at it and see what it looks like on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| Does it come back here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Yes, it will be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| It will go through MPC first, but eventually it will be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| So you need to be checking with MPC to see when that plan comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| When will it come through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Mr. Donaldson can tell you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| I need to amend that process that was laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| The use and review development plan is approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| If there is an appeal, that goes to the Board of Zoning Appeals rather than the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| Do you have a schedule on submitting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| The best we could do, the best we would be able to submit would be for the July meeting would be the absolute earliest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| that we would be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| So that's the meeting, MPC meeting you need to be at, Mr. Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| And we will, again, post the property and send out a postcard and publish it in the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| I would like to make commissioners aware that we did hold a community meeting prior to the last MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:11| and we fully intend to hold a community meeting prior to the use and review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| so that they will have a chance to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| That's just part of our practice and the way we work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| That may take care of some of his questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Commissioner McKenzie, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| I guess I'm just looking at the map here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| So I'm assuming that everything in red is greater than 25 percent slope, just like the legend says, and yellow is 15% to 25%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| But that was due to excavation for, there's currently an abandoned structure on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| and there was plans to do, like, a child care facility or a Jewish temple facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| or something like that in which they had not secured the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| They were out there grading and created some of those slope issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| We have performed a topographic survey of the entire site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| and determined that the areas that are showing up in red are actually from that grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| That being said, we still plan to stay away from the stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| and away from the natural slopes that are coming close to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| So I guess this property is, from this, would be southeast of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Are you planning on lining up 11 houses on that south?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| Not on that one line, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Now, are we going to have houses to that side of the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| We will be forced to, to stay away from the stream that's to the northwest and the slope issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| But they won't be all along that one property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=775)|
| 0:13:04| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| Everyone understands what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=788)|

| 0:13:54| As amended, this is on first reading, Ordinance 0-10-5-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=834)|

| 0:14:15| Going back up to zoning request 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| Request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission to adopt the amended East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| This is 2-A-10-SAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:36| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| Go ahead, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| This is a request of the Planning Commission for approval by the County Commission of the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=892)|
| 0:15:06| update, which is an amendment of the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:16| It's an amendment initiated by the Planning Commission on a periodic basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| We do these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| We try to get to every sector every seven or eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| This particular sector was last done in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| We started this update process about two years ago, have had numerous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:39| and I suspect that all of you are familiar with the issues by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| So there are, in addition to the Midway Business Park issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| there are many good planning recommendations in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| We have identified seven or eight development nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| We've identified a French Broad River Preservation Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| and have made recommendations as far as protecting some of the highway corridors in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=966)|
| 0:16:13| protecting the French Broad River Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| and generally allowing for a mix of uses in those planning nodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| that we have identified as special districts in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Those are the EC01 through EC07 that you see in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| Your job tonight is to vote either to approve the update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| which has been adopted by the Planning Commission, or to not approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Changes in state law in 2008 did provide a path for the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| to make amendments to the regional plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| but they have to be initiated by you, sent to the Planning Commission for a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| then brought back to you for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| You're not bound by any recommendation of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| on those amendments that are initiated by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| For those amendments that are initiated by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| after they have been adopted by the Planning Commission and sent to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| your job is to vote to make them operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| The word operative appears in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| Tonight, you're voting either to make the plan amendment operative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| or voting against it and make it not operative and leave the plan the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| Then we can deal with any amendments that you may want to initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| I've got, in addition to Buzz, Mike Carberry and Jeff Archer from our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| are here for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| They're the primary authors of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| And if we get into specifics, they can handle those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| If there are any questions of me, I will step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| What our procedures will be, we're going to let the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| people that are opposed have ten minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| and people that are in favor to have ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| So you can, I don't know what side wants to go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| the opposition or the people in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| We'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| So the people that are in favor, they can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| Then we'll come back with rebuttals of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| And you can have more than one person within your ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| Hello, I am Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| I'm the Executive Vice President of Development Corporation of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| 17 Market Square, number 201, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| As Mark mentioned, what you've got before you tonight is East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| which geographically encompasses everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| including the Holston River and the French Broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| It's 40,000-plus acres of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| And as he also mentioned, this process has been going on for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| And in February, the Planning Commission adopted this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| And as you know, we've got 380 acres at Midway Road Interstate Interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| It's part of this sector plan, and it has been designated as technology park, business park, or town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| And we are advocating the need and appropriateness of this land being designated for business park use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| Business parks are assets that benefit the entire community, supporting job creation, a stable tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| And Development Corporation has been involved and responsible for development of five business parks in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| most of which are out in the Pellissippi Parkway, Hardin Valley Road area, and the one out in Mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| But they've led to the creation of 5,000 direct jobs and 5,000 indirect jobs to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| accounting for wages of $528 million annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| The proposed business park, at its development and completion, has anticipated to create 2,000 direct jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| as many indirect jobs and $200 million in annual payroll in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| And it's our job as economic development professionals to be thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and planning for our community's future and its economic development needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| And this includes having an adequate supply of attractive business park properties that can attract new businesses to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| Economic development is just not a one approach to solve all problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| It's multifaceted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| If we're going to increase jobs, wealth, and the taxability in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| and our staff at Development Corporation and as well at the Knoxville Chamber are involved in many of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| such as entrepreneurial development, workforce development preparedness, existing industry support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| and, you know, a favorable business climate includes everything from things that you control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| certainly like adequate infrastructure, quality education, and low taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| But at the end of the day, if we do not have product either in buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| or in land or some combination thereof, we will not be considered for many projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| You don't even get on the radar screen if you can't meet the basic necessities of companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| And oftentimes that's business park and land that's suited and zoned accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:55| So to specifically speak about business parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| about 25 percent of the prospects that we deal with are looking for land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| And that's a percentage that we cannot and should not ignore if we expect to compete for these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| And we can't wait to the end of the day until we're completely out of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| And we're very low and not even competitive with many of our communities in the south that we compete with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| And it's not a situation that's going to fix itself, and we have to deal with this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| And I realize that your jobs as county commissioners are often difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| probably not even fun or challenging, and that no matter what decision you make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| if you make a decision that's in the best interest of the county at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| that's going to mean that there are going to be people that disagree with your position, resentful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| and that's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| It's difficult to please everyone when you're trying to deal with what's good for the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| I know you've been bombarded with all kinds of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and objections to proposed business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| and it's unfortunate that you've had to sort through this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| and try to figure out what's valid and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| And we have done what we can to try to answer those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| and objections and give you information on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| Because of the ever-changing string of those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| I suspect there will be something new thrown up today that we will try our best to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| And if there's anything that we've already given you information on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| and you want further clarification, we'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Let me just say in closing that, you know, your professional planning staff, the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| both of whom this body relies on for direction in making land use and policy decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| has said that the Midway Road Interstate Interchange is an appropriate location for a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| Your professional economic development staff, the Nossel Chamber and Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| as well as their respective boards are all advocating the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| and the adequacy for the exit 402 is an appropriate and desirable location for a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:10| So I ask you and encourage you to listen to your professional staff, the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| the chamber, development corporation, and respective boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| and adopt the East County Sector Plan that was approved by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| that includes a business park is a valid use at the Midway Road Interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| And that's all I have as far as prepared statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| One's in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Still five more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:43| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| I'm Rhonda Rice, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| I'm the Executive Vice President of the Knoxville Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| which houses your economic development program for Knox County as well as the innovation value program for the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| Now, everything Todd said, I'm going to try not to reiterate any of that this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| I know everyone's been here a while today already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| But I do think it's important, a couple of things to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Southern Business and Development Magazine just ranked Knoxville sixth out of 17 states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| in new business growth for the last decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| That means out of large metropolitan areas in 17 states in our region that we were the sixth best growing community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| Knox County is a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| We need to continue and to stay on track with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| In order to do so, then we need to make sure that we're planning efficiently and effectively for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| We need to make sure that we're preparing the future so that if we do get that new school in Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| there's the tax base there with the new industry that can grow and help support that new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| We want to make sure that we're doing things in a very thoughtful and productive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| I think we have tried to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| We are partnering with the state of Tennessee, with TVA, with UT, with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| and we are looking at all the resources possible that we can continue to grow jobs in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| We don't see the major automotive manufacturers like Chattanooga was fortunate to receive in Volkswagen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| It took them over 20 years to build and develop Enterprise South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| The old Army munitions plant that was there, they went through a number of processes, redevelopment, reconfiguration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| and spent millions and millions of dollars in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| It's a long-term game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| It doesn't happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| So I ask that you guys think smart about what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| We're here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| We're here for the future of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| and we want to make sure that we stay on track and continue to do well in climbing those rankings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| for a great place to grow a business, to live, and to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| There's still three minutes if one more person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1614)|
| 0:27:04| I'm Michael Strickland, 3572 Captains Way in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Thank you all for doing what you do today and hearing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Many of you have heard what I have to say before, and for those of you that have heard it, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| But very simply, I'm the chair of the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| The board is separate from the paid staff, if you will, in that we are you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| We are the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| And I have met with several hundred people in the last six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| and discussed many different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| The most compelling issue that we discussed was the need for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| We've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| The emotional and the logical reasons as to whether this is or is not a good place have all been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| What is a compelling fact that we all agree on is that we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| The Volkswagen plant needed 200-plus acres to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| We didn't have a place with 200-plus acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| I own two commercial buildings that sit empty right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| I realize that this potentially could make those buildings not be rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| But that's okay because eventually they'll be rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| We've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| We need more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| In my role as chamber chair, when I meet with people that come into this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| and right now we have three hot prospects on the hook, they're looking for land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| We've lost three projects in the last three years because we didn't have this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| So we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| We've got to come up with some available land in order that we can economically grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| because if we don't grow, we die on the vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| Now the opposition will have ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| I have Elaine Clark and Ed McAllister that signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| Whoever else, within the ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| Chairman Strickland, I would like to save my time for the end in case there are other people here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| Just to put it on the record, my name is Elaine Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| I live at 8003 Thorn Grove Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Everyone that is in opposition to this sector plan change, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| Everyone here today is in opposition of this, just to put it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:37| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| My name is Lisa Starbuck, and my address is 6233 Baberly Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| I want to thank you for the opportunity to address this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| and I will assure you that we're going to do our best to be respectful of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| And as has been said, I know there's a tremendous amount of information that has been provided to you on the Midway Road Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1796)|
| 0:30:07| And still there are many questions that are still unanswered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:16| I know I'm guilty as anyone else of filling up your e-mail boxes and giving you handouts with information about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| And, in fact, I have some handouts that I'm going to be sending around after my talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| I have a very brief PowerPoint presentation that I'd like to show you, just a few slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| And what I'm going to do is address some of the comments that have been made regarding information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| and misinformation that has been going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| So I hope that you'll be able to either see the screen or see your screens in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:56| This presentation is in response to the Development Corporation circulating a document entitled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| The Development Corporation of Knox County's Responses to the Talking Points Circulated by Opponents of the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| We did not get the courtesy of receiving a copy of that since it was sent Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| We didn't have a chance to prepare a document with counterpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| So there's a little bit of misinformation that's involved in that and somewhat misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:29| So with your indulgence, I'm going to point out a few things for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:42| This first slide that we're looking at here is, this is from their document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| and the response is the assertion that the Sturkey property was ever developed as an industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| is pure fabrication, and was never marketed for sale as a business location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| Overlaid on top of that is a new Sentinel article dated June 10, 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| and it says, 155-acre tract unsuccessfully marketed to industry for five years is being given to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:13| It goes on to say at the end, the last quote is, despite marketing it as an industrial site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| Edward said, we could not get anybody to be interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| So that is a statement that is not quite right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| The Internet's a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| It allows a diligent researcher to find out information that others may have long forgotten about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| The next slide that I'd like to show you is an assertion, another, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| from the Development Corporation's talking points rebuttal that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| the community is very concerned with the geological site problems and slope issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| and the Development Corporation's response is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| the vast majority of this site is relatively flat with a slope of less than six percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| Well, I have a MPC slope analysis of potential Midway Business Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| and it clearly shows that slope zero to six percent is approximately 25 percent of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| which is hardly the vast majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:37| The Coster Shop property was redeveloped and then purchased by Cisco, facilitating 250 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:45| Speaking of sinkholes, the Development Corporation has said that they're confident they can develop this business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| without contaminating the groundwater and that they won't get near the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| They want the community to trust them with our water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| but I'm sure the people of Burnett's Creek would tell us that is very ill-advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| On top of that, I noticed that the Development Corporation didn't have a response to our assertion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| except to say that it made 250 jobs, but they also say, and from this new Sentinel article dated January 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:19| parties in a nearly half-billion-dollar federal lawsuit over the dumping of contaminated soil into a Knox County sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| have reached an out-of-court settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| The defendants include the city of Knoxville and the Development Corporation of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| in case you might have forgotten about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| The next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| This is a map, slope map that, again, was provided by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| And if you're like me, you have a hard time reading these maps sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| And one thing that I would like to draw your attention to is that there are a lot of red areas on that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| And what those red areas are is very steep slopes that lead to sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:09| There are numerous sinkholes on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| And the Development Corporation would have you believe that somehow or another, out of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| with all these sinkholes and the slope issues, that they're going to get a big chunk of land that somehow is going to be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| than what we have in other business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| However, as you can see from this map, they can't develop large contiguous tracks because they're going to have to work around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| sinkholes and the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| There are eight large sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| I'm talking about big enough for a house that we know of and numerous other sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| So the Development Corporation saying, trust us, we're going to do an on-site septic system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| or an on-site wastewater plant and we're not going to impact the water quality is a very big concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| especially given their history with sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:27| This slide is an assertion from the Development Corporation about a comment that the community made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| that economic development involves much more than just building business parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| that an educated workforce is a primary draw for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| And their response was, for an accurate full explanation of what Dr. Murray actually said, please see his attached email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| Well, perhaps they should have read his email a little more closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| because he says he doesn't really know the details of the Midway project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| In general, I agree that it takes more than one component for a successful economic development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| And I totally agree with Dr. Murray that our, however, I believe that our current economic development is lopsided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:17| with far too much emphasis placed on making land deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| and not enough focus on growing our small businesses and educating and retaining our existing workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| From this new Sentinel article that Mr. Murray was quoted as saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| many unemployed workers who are in the state won't have the skills that employers need in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| And further, one of the assertions the Development Corporation made was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| they think light manufacturing would work well at Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| However, Dr. Murray says many of these jobs are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| the jobs that are going to be lost are in old line manufacturing, lower skilled manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| and companies can and will replace those jobs with mechanization, automation, computer technologies, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2276)|
| 0:38:06| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| This slide, the assertion is that we have said that we believe that the ultimate end goal here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:21| is to place a sewer plant on the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| And that is certainly something that has been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| and that they have contemplated and openly discussed for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| And the reason for doing that is to open up the south and east Knox County for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| And TDC responds to that assertion and says there are no facts behind this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| It is purely speculative and completely false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| So I thought the best way for you to hear about this is from the horse's mouth, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| How about you have about 45 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:12| In other words, if any area around or in southeast Knox County wants sewer service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| it's not going to get it by this investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| One of the things that so what we've thought is prudent is for to ask you, eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:33| if you want us to take the $4 million that we would put in the on-site treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| and provide it to KUB for a water treatment plant that would service that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| Somebody, as I understand it, and I'm getting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| if somebody was to dump a whole lot of antibiotics into the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| then it's easier to have that diluted over a municipal plant than it is a treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2393)|
| 0:40:01| The area has the potential to develop with modern sewer at a greater level than it does without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:13| The affluent that would go into the river and what KUB is talking about doing is a tertiary treatment plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:26| which is a step beyond what they have in the other plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| It's not contaminated, but, you know, that's where a lot of debates are going to happen, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| I would say, for what it's worth, the option that I'm most interested in is one that opens sewer up to the community in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:51| I'm mildly committed to the, well, I should say a bit more than mildly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| I'm fairly committed to the industrial project, but I'm extremely committed to opening up utilities to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2456)|
| 0:41:05| So whichever option is going to facilitate that is the one I'm going to be most in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| Let's talk about good times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| I would ask your indulgence for 30 seconds more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| I do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| You will get five more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| After they get five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| I think that there is an awful lot of people here who took some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| and took the trouble to come downtown and park and be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| So I would hope that we would have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| Again, I don't want to go on and on about this, but I know that there are others who would have something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| People that are in favor, you get five more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2512)|
| 0:42:02| You know, there's a lot of point, counterpoint, counterpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| I'll hit them real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Sturgy property, you know, until dry gap roads improved, it couldn't be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| It still can't be reached adequately today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| The slope, 25% or less of slope, I don't think that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| She talked about all the red areas leading to sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| That's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| There's some that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| There's a big draw down the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| We have shown you a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| I've given you a plan on how we work around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| Dr. Murray's email, you know, is a point that he was being quoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| I'll read you the last paragraph, which you didn't read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| I hope you know as well as I that successful economic development requires a set of assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| Building parks alone will not create jobs without complementary infrastructure and skill force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| By the same token, the skilled workforce alone cannot support economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| in the absence of a place for business to locate and thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| I hope that communities recognize the multifaceted nature of economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| and the need for the facilities like Midway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| If we plan well now, we can attract the future path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| We can affect the future path of economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| If we step back and do nothing, we will have no control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| or influence over the region's path of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| I don't think I could hardly hear, you know, the video clip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| But, you know, I was at a meeting where we talked to you all early on and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| and we're going to have a decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| This body's going to have a decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| We've got up to $4 million to invest in the sewer plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| We can either do it all on site, which is where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| We've said that now for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| That's the direction we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Or we could put that money toward a regional park, a regional wastewater treatment facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| which would serve the entire watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| But this commission or somebody was going to have to come up with another $7 or $8 million to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| And I think it's become pretty clear that there's not the money to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| and I don't think there's the desire to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| So we have never done this to facilitate any developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:14| We have always been interested in providing wastewater treatment options for the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| We have a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| They keep saying it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| There's examples of it in other manufacturing applications and other business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| It's also in some very large residential developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| We've got a wastewater consultant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Some specific questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| I guess that's all I've got to say is this is about economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| about having sites for us to be able to meet the present need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| Let me back up for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| You know, if we got approval on this thing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| it's going to take two or three years before we can have prepared sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| And I expect we'll be challenged all the way up down the road on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| But these are not overnight things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| You can't wait to do them, and they are about planning for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| Business parks are 15-, 20-year investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| You know, we're still reaping some of the benefits from the investments that we've made in our existing business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| A couple of them are nearly full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| The one we have the most space in is out in Mascot and East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| It's been the most difficult, and that's because of the distance to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| Those in favor still have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| Someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| Are you for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| People that are in favor, you still have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| Okay, opposition has five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| Scott, can you read me through my PowerPoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| I'm going to do one more slide that I think is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| and then we're going to ask people from the community to speak, and our attorney, David Boock, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| The opposition just has five more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Yes, sir, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| I'd like to point out Pellissippi Place, which is 450 acres of flat land with all amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| It's been vacant since 2006, and we don't have any tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| This is a story in the Sunday New Sentinel about how Pellissippi Place is never developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| and, you know, there's no reason why it shouldn't because it has all the advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| This is Hardin Business Park, which also has no tenants, 80 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| And final slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| This is the Rutledge Pike Industrial Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| It shows that there is well over 2,600 acres of available industrial land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| It's unfortunately not owned by the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| but as you can see from the red spot up there that's East Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| it is surrounded by available land that could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| It is only 10 or 15 minutes from the interstate, which most people would find perfectly adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| Ed McAllister, 2918 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| I have the most wonderful job in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| I get to take people out every day of the week, boating on the French Frog, biking on Thorn Grove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| and Kodak Road, trail running in Seven Islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| I see hundreds of people every day that move to Knoxville as I did for a quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| You move here, you can find a job, and you can make a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| We have a half-empty full glass of wine here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| We've got a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Most people don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Let's put it in mouth bottles, wait until we have a tenant, then let's address it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:57| East Knoxville is a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Let's keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:10| Is there anyone else from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| Three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| My name is Elaine Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| I reside at 8003 Thorn Grove Pike in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| I represent the French Frog Preservation Association, a not-for-profit community organization whose mission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| to preserve, protect, and enhance the rural, agricultural, and historical qualities of the French Frog River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| Corridor and its surrounding communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| The FBPA is an advocate for a balance of planned quality growth that conserves, preserves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| and enhances the rural agrarian culture and lifestyle of a diverse and vibrant community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| while sustaining a strong sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| We are pleased with the update of the East County Sector Plan as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| Our opposition is focused on the Midway Project at Midway and Thorn Grove Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| First and foremost, it is urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| This project is building a major employment center on the edge of the county without a major population center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| therefore promoting long commutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| This is at odds with MPC's own Sustainable Development Initiative, of which one objective is to reduce commuting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| I do understand that that is within the planned growth area, but I would like to point out that just because Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:40| Road is within the planned growth area, when we have plenty of available sites closer in to our urbanized area in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:50| Knox County, plenty of vacant land now, I do not understand why we need to go to the far end of the planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| area when we still have property far inside the center city that can still be developed out before we start going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:06| the outlying counties and the edge of the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| Second, the overwhelming majority of the citizens of this area are opposed to this zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| When 80 percent of the people do not believe this is a good idea, it is the responsibility of our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| officials to hear their voice and respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:36| I think everybody has gone over the excess inventory that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| We do have hundreds of acres that are already available in existing business parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| and we need to pursue filling those business parks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| We should sell the inventory we have on the books, putting people to work today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| because we have close to 10 percent unemployment in this country today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| Let's put our dollars in the business parks we already have in existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| and let's put a big move on selling that inventory and putting people to work today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| We can deal with 20 years down the road in two or three years from now to see where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| Last, it is a bad business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| It will cost Knox County a substantial amount of future public expense to build a speculative park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| with no prospective tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| The development corporation has spent $10 million of taxpayer money in land acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| and will need at least another $20 million for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| And I would like to point out that the waste treatment facility that the development corporation is pursuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| is unprecedented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| I believe their representative talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| It has never been used in an industrial setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| It's only been used in a residential rural area to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| One on record that they have handles 7,500 gallons a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| The treatment facility that would be needed at the Midway project would handle 200,000 gallons a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| That's speculated at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| The FBPA and East County citizens are requesting either a deferment on the vote of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| or if the plan, if you have to vote on the plan, we say don't vote for it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| Reject the sector plan that is on the books and send it back to MPC and let's address Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| and rezone it to what it is currently now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| A task force would be a fantastic thing to go for at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| We have the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Let's do something great for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| We have an opportunity to provide something that could bring those big businesses that development corporation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:52| trying to lure into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| If we promoted our assets, as Mr. McAllister said, we could have a gem out there at the Midway Interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3175)|
| 0:53:03| the gateway into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| We think it's worth the time and effort to look into that possibility, look at alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| and let's make a really good decision for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:29| Commissioners, do you have any questions for anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| I have several questions, I guess, that will be addressed to several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| And let me say that I've been following this process for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Back in 2005, I was part of the debate process here on commission for that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| and so I'm familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Spent Thursday afternoon talking with folks in the chamber and spent yesterday afternoon talking with folks out in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| First of all, I guess someone from the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| We don't hear a lot about Pellissippi Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| and it was prominently showcased in the newspaper yesterday about 450 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| but yet we have yet to see any bricks being laid except, I guess, for the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| I guess my question is we don't hear you all talk much about Pellissippi Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| Is that part of your marketing efforts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Is that part of something that you present to businesses that come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| How does this fit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| And the fact that you have this land available there and it's been three, four years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| no bricks have been laid, but yet it is near the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| I mean, to me, these are legitimate questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| So how would you respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Commissioner Hammond, I would first of all respond by saying it's actually not open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| Pellissippi Place is not open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| They had the one speculative tenant with molecular pathology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| Pellissippi Place, the property was acquired in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| Since 2000, they have been going through the process and through all of the requirements that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| This is a 50-year plan that they have developed and designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| It's a very specific tenant that's a research and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| You have to be 75% R&D in order to qualify to be in that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| In July of 2009, last year, they did the official groundbreaking, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| to start construction on the site planning for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| In probably June or July of this year, which you all should also receive an invitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| they will officially open the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| The story yesterday obviously talked about how the banking economy has put a crunch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| And the tenant that they had has certainly changed their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| But it's still a long-term process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Do we market it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Do we respond to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| We do that with the same as we do the existing industry, existing buildings that are on or in our inventory here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:53| We do market Pellissippi Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| But, again, there are very specific requirements for the type of user and tenant that would go into that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| And that led to believe that people were ready and waiting to go into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| They are marketing the park, but they can't go in it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| As a matter of fact, as soon as they have the official opening in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| and I spoke with Brian Daniels and he offered to be here tonight to address any questions because he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| I'm afraid that's going to confuse some issues with some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| But once they open the park this summer, then the park will also be shut down basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| because TDOT is putting in a new access road from Pellissippi Park into that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| So it will be shut down once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| My second question has to do with roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| In driving the site yesterday, and you mentioned, I think, Sturkey, the Sturkey property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| and you mentioned the fact that Dry Gap Pike or one road was not suitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| and that was one of the reasons why where the Schumpert Park is now that was not a suitable site was because of the road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| Do I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| Yeah, that was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| In order for that property to actually be marketed and viable as a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| it would have required that Dry Gap Pike be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| A couple of things in the administration came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| The residential development continued to develop around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| And, you know, at a request and with discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| the administration decided that that was a need for a recreational park in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| And would we then be willing to donate that property to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| And that was the decision that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| The road system around the site, those roads, I'm talking about Midway, the road system around Midway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| it seems to me that there's going to need to be improvements made to the roads around there to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| I mean, let's say you do start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| You're going to have heavy trucks going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| Those roads just weren't built for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| What is the plan for the road system around that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| So initially and, well, ultimately it would be to improve Midway Road from the interstate up to Thorn Grove Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| and to improve Thorn Grove Pike through the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| and then to develop roads that would serve internally to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| So there would be some new roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Is that a county expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| No, that's in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| How much will that cost to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| I mean, just roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Just the roads alone, I'd have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| But we are anticipating that about $20 million to build out the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| So that would include the roads, everything that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| And you've spent $10 million on acquisition of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| So we're looking at a total of $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| One final question I have, I guess, Mr. Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| And just one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| On the Pellissippi Place, I think they had said it's a 150-acre business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| It's actually going to be about 230 acres when it's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Oh, that was a question that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Thank you for prompting me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Of the 300 acres, 380, how much is at Midway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| You said 380.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Of that 300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| It'll be 375.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| There's five acres that will go back into a residential back facing on Manila Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| How much of that property will actually be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Because you're going to have obviously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Yes, so you've got, I looked at the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I think it's like 21 acres in right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| We could use up to 25 in Dripfield if we went up to its full 200,000 gallon per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| And there's a good chance that we wouldn't get to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| But we believe that's the limit of property that we would want to put into Dripfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| And then KUB, TVA are looking at a substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| And that's probably around 15 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| although that design has not been finalized and neither has the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| So the bottom line would be how many acres would you have available to market after all the infrastructure, road improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| Let me do the math real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| I heard Dr. McIntyre earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| He said he didn't like to do math in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| I couldn't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:09| So take away about 60, 70 acres from the 370.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| So somewhere around 300 would be left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Mr. Donaldson, two questions for you, one on slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| Are those numbers accurate on the slope that Ms. Starbuck presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| She said that she took them from Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| They're the best numbers that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| We use a fairly sophisticated program that we've developed to look at very small parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:38| and measure the slope of each of those and then accumulate a map out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| Generally, they're pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Secondly, sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Have you done geographic studies there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| I'm sure you have as to the sinkhole situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| Do you have any thoughts on that, anything you could share with us on sinkholes on the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| Well, we certainly know that there are sinkholes on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| They are identified on topographic maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| We haven't done any analysis of them as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| That will happen with development plan approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| The zoning that we're recommending for that area is a planned zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| which requires a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| First you establish the zone district, and then you approve a site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| During the site plan approval, we will look at topography and the geology specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| But we haven't at this point, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Todd, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| I've got one other question for you about financing after you answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| Just on the geology out there, Mike Stomer with SMA is a geologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| and he looked at the site, and I think he can speak to the geology specifically of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| And we have, and I've given to you a layout of a park and how we would lay out the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:04| Now, some of that's going to have to be changed based on where the substation winds up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| and how we lay the drip fields out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| But we can certainly get the lots in there with a reasonable slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| And what you do, we're not going to pancake and, you know, make this site look like Kansas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| We're going to work with the topographies that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| I'm very comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| My name is Mike Stomer, 7731 Dave Road, Knoxville, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| We have done a preliminary geotechnical study on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| and have looked at the sinkholes and had to have TDAC come look at the sinkholes with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| And most of Knox County, as you are aware, is underlain by karst geology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| And so we were concerned about that, and we have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| And we feel as though that area of Knox County is no different than other areas of West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| In fact, all the areas on that map up there that aren't purple essentially are underlain by limestone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| and dolomite, which is a karst geology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| So we do not feel that this site is any extra special as far as karst geology goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:14| And, Mr. Abram, my last question, the $20 million, where will that money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| How will that be financed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| The Development Corporation has about $11 million that we are holding to develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| The IDB is holding, the county is holding about six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| So that's 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| And so between that and property sales is what we will use to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| This will be phased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Hey, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| You know, this has been a very difficult process for everybody, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| Is there a possibility, and I haven't, you haven't heard this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| is there a possibility that phase three could be used as a compromise for community ball fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:09| and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Or is that something that would make this an unviable potential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| I think what we get into, Brad, is we would wind up with, so our basic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| a lot of our underlying basic costs, which are improvements to Thorn Grove Pike to Midway Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| the wastewater treatment system, would really start getting very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| very expensive on a per acre per basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| So I think that that would be something that might preclude that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| I'm referring to the map that you gave, the throw out that you gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Where it says buy others, is that what Mr. Jernigan already owns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| That map, we've not updated it since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| That was done before the sector plan was approved by planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| Our intent there was to put more commercial oriented development there back toward the interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| and that that would be something better suited by somebody else at a future date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| We're going to have to revisit that part of it because one of the things that they did not approve was a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| right there at that interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| You're talking about such as a pilot waggles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Well, it could be that or a grocery store or a hotel or things that would be related to community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| and interstate traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| So that's going to have to be reworked and looked at how we do that as part of the overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| You know, I live in the district where most of the development corporation land is owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:58| and understand the plight that the 8th District is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:06| And I think that, you know, I'm torn because I think this is, you know, we've got to be thinking about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:15| We've got to be thinking about the future of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| And we talk about the money that comes to the 8th District for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| and we talk about the money that the tax base in the 8th District, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| the county has to grow to maintain just the government we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| We have to grow every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| And so we've got to think, you know, I'm still torn on this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| I really haven't been sold one way or the other, but we can't sit still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:49| We got a letter just the other day from a company that wanted to locate near the Carter community but couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| And, you know, that's a couple hundred jobs, or I don't know if it's a couple hundred, 125 jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| that were not low-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| They were welders and engineers and this wasn't a terrible company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| They wanted to be here and we couldn't have them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| You know, and I kind of, I'm probably harder on the chamber than most commissioners are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| and visiting and asking them why they're not filling up West Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| and why the Hardin Valley Park or Hardin Valley Business Park has nobody in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| I've been very frank and very blunt with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| And, you know, my district's been affected the most probably by the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| But I look at Hardin Valley and I look at how it's grown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| and I look at how the connection between Oak Ridge and the things that are happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| I mean, they're still building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| If anybody's building, they're building in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| And it's because of the forethought of widening Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| It's because that we have existing business out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| There's restaurants going up out there that people don't have to leave Hardin Valley anymore if they don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| We've got grocery stores, restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| And I see the potential for Carter that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| You know, Straw Plains, everybody was against Straw Plains growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| But, man, Palaio's and Outback's full every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| And so we've got a tough decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| And I think that we need to look toward the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| and understand that if Knox County doesn't grow, your tax base doesn't grow, your schools don't grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| your property taxes do grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| So those are the things we need to look at, setting aside our emotions and making this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| Speak to the geotechnical engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| I mean, you know, most of this land around here has that potential, that geology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:59| I guess we have a couple of examples close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| A large bank building across the street in Thompson Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| And like I said, this facility as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| And maybe this is between you and Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| So we know there are sinkholes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| In fact, the place I work at, Spallation Neutron Source, had a couple of issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| So we know that there's some around, and there may be some that we don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| And it didn't stop this building from being built or the Thompson Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| What's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| How are we going to address that proactively if we're so –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| well, I guess first I want to ask you, is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| We can expect more than we see today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| That's probably true, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| But typically what we would do is do a geotechnical study for each particular building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| or structure that is constructed in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| And our jobs at our company is to decide what type of foundation to put under that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| or how to mitigate the sinkhole factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| Or if there's a really large cave, we may grout or take care of those particular voids in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| But what we do is engineer a foundation system to support the building safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| So your experience, I guess, nationwide has been pretty successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| Yes, it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Have you had any failures in terms of you designing a facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| We've fixed buildings that have had sinkholes open up underneath them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| Nothing that I personally have worked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Your facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| I mean, I have the same geology on my farm, and I've had to fix a sinkhole on my farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| So, Todd, what's the mitigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| What's your proactive plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Well, the plan is to stay out of the sinkholes and the drainage ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| I'm just saying there's a potential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Well, I mean, what we don't know about, we can't predict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| But what we do know about, we can avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| And that's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| But you can plan for, I mean, if you have some knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| You have some knowledge that in this 380 acres we have, I don't know what the number is, six of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| is there a plan to do some additional environmental studies, to do some core drilling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| to do some, you know, a lot of these things up and up from stormwater, rainwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| Are we out there thinking about how we're going to plan for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| Yeah, so the concept plan that I think you have and we've sent around shows, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| how we are going to lay the roads out and the lots out in a way that stays out of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| You know, if during the course of developing construction plans we find out about other areas we need to work around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| Before we come back with a, because the zoning that's been recommended as part of sector plan is called EC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4312)|
| 1:12:02| Employment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| It's a plan zone, similar to, like, plan residential, plan commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| means you've got to develop a concept plan, your design standards, your setbacks, your building parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4327)|
| 1:12:16| So all of that will be laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| And, you know, so we've got to come back to planning commission with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| and show how and where these things will lay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| And so we've got, and then I talked about, you know, we're going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| give some considerations of where the wastewater is going to lay out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| how the substation is going to affect and how we're going to lay out our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| So there is more work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| What we're asking you to do today is just to approve and say that the interstate in East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:48| at exit 401 interchange in Northwest 2nd is appropriate to be used for business park use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| It doesn't change the zoning at this point and we're not coming with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| So there is other opportunities to continue to refine that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| And through that to address those issues even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| But I want you to be proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| I don't want you to be reactive on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| I know that this is step one of 300, but let's, if we have some knowledge, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| and if this is a successful project, you're planning on putting a building there sometime at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:21| So I just, I guess, urge you all to kind of be proactive with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| And I guess my second to last question is about your, sorry, Bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| is about your wastewater treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| I guess, help me understand the logic behind going with a new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| And I'm not opposed to new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| And this system sounds great in terms of, you know, keeping, having no infiltration is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:54| But I guess my question is why go with a newer system as opposed to a, the more traditional methods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4434)|
| 1:14:05| New in terms of industry, I guess I'd say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| Well, one of the primary drivers is the fact that to run force main or gravity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| or a combination thereof to any of the existing facilities is anywhere, I think, from nine to 11 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| Or thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| And the cost to do that, the cost benefit is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| So when you look around at other options, one of them is certainly not any cheaper, but it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| and therefore if you do all that, you're really still basically only serving the existing proposed business part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4476)|
| 1:14:45| The other would be then to develop a new wastewater treatment plant which opens up the watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| And it's about the same amount of money, but you get more bang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| So the other option that's being used in places across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| and for different uses is to go with an on-site treatment system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| So it's going to treat to the same level of quality as your traditional wastewater treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| The difference is rather than dumping the treated water, the effluent to a water body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:18| which is typically done, it's done on Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| it's done on Melton Hill, Tennessee River, is you disperse it over the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:28| and you can either spray or drip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| So it's a cost issue that makes sense that we believe works for this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4531)|
| 1:15:44| Okay, so, you know, we've said it's never been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| You know, there's a business park down in Alabama, Bryan County, called the Interstate Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| You know, they've got a mix of manufacturing and distribution centers down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| You've got a company that makes adhesive film, one that makes medical and cosmetic sponges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| military small arms and commercial rifles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| Then there's some distribution centers and they're getting ready to open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| That was like 270 acres initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| They're opening up another 500 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| And they're on this type of system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Rather than drip, they spray irrigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| Is there roughly that 200,000 gallons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| So what they've been permitted for is 100,000 gallons per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| but what they're finding is and what I expect we're going to find as well is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| that because you're not specifically recruiting companies to that site that are large wastewater generators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| that I expect we'll be in the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| Part of what's driving that 200,000-gallon max is I'm saying based on the soils we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| and our understanding of that and perk rates is it really doesn't make sense to devote more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| than about 20, 25 acres for drip field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| At that point, you start losing your return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| So I anticipate and am hopeful that we will be able to fill that business park up on much less than 200,000 gallons per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:13| But then there's some other manufacturing uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| and some very large-scale residential development in Granger County just last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| They have been approved for this same type of system up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| I need to confirm this, but my understanding is 185,000 gallon per day permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| You know, it's going to serve residential, commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| and the new what they call Blaine Business Park up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| So, you know, it's not unprecedented, and the State of Tennessee is approving these systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:51| Commissioner Bereave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| I'd like to thank all the citizens from the 8th District that have come here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| It's really important that people be involved in decisions like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| and in particular, I see Elaine Clark's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| and I know it was several months ago we had breakfast at Pete's down here talking about the slopes and hilltop problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| Bob Wolfenbarger and I had a beautiful Saturday several weeks ago going throughout the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| where he showed me the site, and it was just a beautiful drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| It was a wonderful morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| And Lisa Starbucks and I have exchanged e-mails and had a lot of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| These and many others of you who are sitting out there are concerned citizens whom I have no doubt that you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| you have the best interest of Knox County at heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| and many of you have done a lot to make this place a much better place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| Nevertheless, those of us on the commission have to make some very difficult decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| on very important issues that affect the community not just now, but even five to ten years in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| Just as Knox County doesn't exist in a vacuum, and we are at the whims of the economy of the rest of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| and the world, our decisions tonight don't stand alone, and they can have far-reaching implications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:15| not only for the places we live, but our schools and our quality of life in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| I suggest that everyone on the commission read this book on the history of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| written by Dr. Bruce Wheeler over at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| For sentimental readers, it's really a tearjerker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| It's a tearjerker for missed opportunities, for the lack of vision from our community leaders in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4776)|
| 1:19:44| and it really makes one wonder what we really could have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| In the book, Dr. Wheeler talks about articles that were written in the, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| the New York Times at the turn of the century, where they predicted that within 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| Knoxville would be the queen of the south and the pride of the new south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| We would be the second city after Atlanta, greater than New Orleans, greater than Charlotte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:12| greater than Birmingham, Alabama, Nashville, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| The Richmond, Virginia newspaper predicted that we would be the leading economic center of the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| second only to Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| It begs the question, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Where did we go wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| What happened was the unwillingness to embrace progressive change, to welcome new enterprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4830)|
| 1:20:38| that bring high-paying jobs to our community and also our ambivalence to pay for an education for our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4838)|
| 1:20:46| a world-class education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| I'm really saddened that we're sitting here tonight having the same discussions that's been going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| really, for the past century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| And unfortunately, we've paid dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| We've paid dearly for poor decisions that have been made by our leaders in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| To attract the right type of businesses to Knox County, we have to give the development corporation the tools they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| to bring high-paying jobs into this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| Some of those tools include having an inventory and a menu of land that businesses want to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4876)|
| 1:21:25| We also have to give them the tools of a workforce through our educational system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| and also quality of life issues that some of us may or may not think are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| but they are important people that are people that are moving into this community from other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| such as the arts, the symphony, the opera, and also maintaining the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| which is a very strong attraction to this community also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| As we attract the right type of businesses to this community, they support our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| they contribute to the arts, and they also participate in the life of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| Many of the community grants that we have to give to support the arts now could be supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| by corporate sponsorship if we attract those type of businesses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| This also takes the tax burden off the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| One of the other benefits we've been struggling with for hours before this meeting tonight dealt with our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:23| We're trying to find $1.7 million to save schools' teachers' jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| To give you an example within the past decade of a decision we made that may have had an impact on that is the Hackney Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:37| I asked the development corporation, what did we lose when the Hackney Company went to Roane County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:47| We lost $20 million in payroll and just in property and sales taxes, $775,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| That's half of what we needed just in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| This doesn't count the other benefits to fund those teachers' jobs that were lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:07| If we look at the industrial park, in 2005, the county collected $11,500 in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:18| Once the park's built out, it would reach $9.4 million according to 2005 tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:29| That's enough for teachers' raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| That's enough to preserve all the teachers' jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| It's enough to build a new Carter Elementary School and we'd have plenty left over for the arts and libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:41| Some of the new businesses that occupy that park may become corporate sponsors of the arts and libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| and even save the taxpayers that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| I know some have suggested that we develop Midway Park as a tourist attraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| or some sort of agricultural collection center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| The problem is that these jobs are low-paying, dead-end jobs with few benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:09| In the next 20 years, by the year 2030, it seemed like that was a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| but it's really only 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| It's been projected that Knox County will increase its population about 140,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| When we make the decision tonight, it's not do we have a tenant to go on the property now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| but what are we going to have in five years, ten years, and 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| I think Commissioner Brown made a very good point with reference to planning for our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| and that is we don't need to be looking just at next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| We need to be looking five and ten years down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| and on economic development, we need to be looking 20 years down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| If the leaders of this community in the 1920s, 30s, 40s, and 50s had made the difficult decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5092)|
| 1:24:59| in spite of well-meaning citizens who didn't want some of these changes to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| we would not be in the situation we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| and we would be able to compete with any other city in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| because of many of the assets that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| We can't look upon change as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| It's a crucial necessity, and I'll be the first to admit that sometimes change makes me nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| I own a farm out in Hardin Valley in western Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| and I may be the only farmer among the group here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| And I really hate to see farmland change, but we have to embrace it if we really care about our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| and we really care about the other aspects of quality of life that change entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| And for this reason, I wish we would break with the tradition that's been a series of bad decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| over the last hundred years and really start looking to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| and say this is the type of community that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:07| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| Thank you, Dr. Riggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Todd, I've got a few questions for you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:18| You've already told most of them, but I want to be sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| What would be the estimate, the difference between this private treatment system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| and getting sewer up to there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| I understood you said it was nine to 11 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| But if you've got any estimates from KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| I just wonder how much more it would be maybe to help the people in that community with sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| I'll let Mr. Elmore from KUB speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| Commissioners, when we first-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| I need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Bill Elmore, Knox Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| 1848 Stonebrook Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| We looked at that early on as a number of options when we started looking at how to best serve the industrial park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5216)|
| 1:27:03| and how to best serve the area as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| We looked at each of the wastewater treatment plants that we have today in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| The two closest would be Loves Creek and the East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| And then we even looked so far as going to cooperating with Sevierville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| and taking the waste to Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| Regardless of which of those three directions you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| it was anywhere from six to nine miles, if I remember correctly, to get back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| The problem is if you're trying to move wastewater that far to an existing plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5256)|
| 1:27:45| number one is you're taking up capacity that was designed in those other plants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| to meet the needs of the service area of those plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| So you're getting to a point where you're putting an existing plant at risk in terms of its ability to serve future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| in the area that it was designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| But more importantly, or at least as importantly, you're creating an operational situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:12| where by trying to move waste that far through a combination of pumping stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:19| force mains, and gravity mains, that by the time you get it to its destination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| you run the real risk of it being septic and basically very, very difficult to treat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| particularly in the early days, the early stages when you've got small flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| and a pumping station and force main that's designed for average daily flows at some point 10 years, 15 years in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:46| So it becomes an operational nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| The bottom line, though, in terms of cost, if you can get past those other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| I think we were looking at something in the neighborhood of $4 million to $5 million for an onsite treatment system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| or as much as $12, $13 million to get that flow to another plant where it could be treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:11| without the use of a plant in the vicinity of the Midway Park or in the area nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| So a significant difference in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| But I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| I wouldn't care to bite the bullet to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| But what I think I've heard you say is there's a danger that the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| even if we run it there, may not be able to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| If you try to take it to one of our other existing plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| Now, the fourth option we looked at was building a plant in the drainage basin, East Knox County drainage basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:44| That would eliminate the long travel distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| That would eliminate many of the operational problems that would have been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| But, again, that was something that we were only willing to do if the community wanted that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| if this body wanted that, because KUB is not in a position of funding that level of improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| and particularly not doing so if it were against the community's wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| Do you know what that would cost, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| I think the cost of doing that is somewhere in the $12 million range as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| And the onsite treatment was roughly $4 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| If I remember correctly, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| Another $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Todd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| I just want to be sure I understood you correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| You said the development corporation had $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| The IDB board has six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| It's going to take roughly $20 million to build this thing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| and you're going to acquire the rest of it through sales of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| In other words, you're not up here asking for any money or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| You think you've got the assets lined up to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| And I believe also you said it would be two to three years before you could get all this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| Well, that would take that long before we would have property available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| I think that's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| I think we need to listen very carefully to what Dr. Briggs said because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| we live here in a university town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| Your children go over here and they get an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| When they come out, there's no jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| I hear that from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| There's no jobs in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| Why don't we have jobs here, they'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| Our kids are having to leave and nobody wants their kids to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| and most people want to live where they were born and raised at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| We have to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| If we don't grow, we're just going to turn into, well, we're just going to rot on the vine, as you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| So I'm like Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| We have to make a lot of hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| When I first came up here, I said I want to let this property sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| I told some people that I didn't think we need to spend any money because I thought they were probably going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| to the county and ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| But they've shown a way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| And I will be voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| I wish I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| This is one of the hardest ones that I've dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| I think there's kind of three groups probably up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| There's a group that's certainly in favor and there's a group that's opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| And then there's some of us that are kind of hung in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| And it seems like I want to thank everybody, first of all, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| Of course, all of the people that are in opposition have put out hundreds of hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| maybe thousands of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| They're unpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| They're volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| This is sweat equity they put into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| I thank all of you all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| The Development Corporation, this is their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| They're doing it as best they know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| This is what they believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| They believe in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| And they're promoting it as best they know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| I want to thank the commission and people like me that are suffering over the decision especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5594)|
| 1:33:21| There's, in this process, at the end of it, I hope that the people that are disappointed respect the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5601)|
| 1:33:35| I'll respect every single person on here in their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| And however it turns out, I'll be glad, first of all, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| And then, if I'm on the losing side, I respect this body and its collective voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5626)|
| 1:33:57| And so I hope you do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| I agree with Dr. Briggs about missed opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| and his extraction from the book about Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| Those of us that are natives here know that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| We experience that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| We go around in our city, and I think we're struck with maybe disappointment and regret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:29| We know many instances where we have not had vision and we haven't had leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:36| And so I totally agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| When I get down to issues, when I get into Midway and into those 380 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5681)|
| 1:34:51| though I do have lots of questions about its use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| I think probably most of all, the core issue now for me becomes this issue of sort of our inventory of land and its use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5697)|
| 1:35:11| And where is that vision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| And I agree, maybe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| Maybe if we do not commit to the Midway Park, we possibly could be missing an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:24| But somehow in the discussion of all that inventory of land and vacant buildings and space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:33| I also see I think there may be an opportunity there because I don't know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5733)|
| 1:35:42| well, I hear the use of the word competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| and then I see some numbers about the places that we're competing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| And when I see the numbers that were provided in terms of business parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| and land available for the type of thing Midway is available for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| we can't compete with those thousands of acres in those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| And so then it strikes me, well, maybe that's not the way to compete after all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| Maybe the way to compete is in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| Maybe the way to compete is to use what we have in a different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| market those things maybe in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| And I'm no authority at all about solar conversions and cool roofs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| and megawatts generated for this and that, stormwater systems that are green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| and that kind of thing and brownfield sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| But somehow I'm drawn to that and those ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| And that's just where my vision tends to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| My vision tends to be to retain as much green as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| to use that space out there in a way that's non-industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5814)|
| 1:37:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| That's just the way I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| But on the other hand, but I greatly appreciate all involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5829)|
| 1:37:20| I greatly appreciate all of you all's work and your effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| Commissioner Fondas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| I also want to join all the commissioners in thanking everybody here for your incredible efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| for your involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| This kind of discussion, wherever you may be on the spectrum, is really healthy for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| We have talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| This conversation has gone on for over two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| In fact, the citizen involvement has made an impact on the plans that we are looking at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:57| I thank Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Change is the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| That has been the status quo forever, for all of my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| If I look back at my life in this community, which has been 65 years now, there has been tremendous change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| Yes, we have missed some opportunities, and I regret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| And I regret that some of us have been unwilling to step up and help those changes occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| Commissioner Pinkston and his remarks about the wastewater treatment basically ensuring that it serves only the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:30| is important to me, and I think it's important to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| That's certainly what I heard from the very outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| I would offer one thing in that regard and wonder, and I'm not sure, given Mr. Donaldson's remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| that I can do this, but I would like to offer that we ask that effluent from off the site not be allowed to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:53| on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| In other words, yes, it treat only those entities that are on the site and accept nothing from off the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5934)|
| 1:39:02| And I will stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| I've heard a lot of impassioned plea about the advancement of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:24| I think, though, what is before us in the Midway Road interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:33| it's all we've talked about in the East Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| I think that the East Sector Plan is probably, the East County Sector Plan has probably been very well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5977)|
| 1:39:45| I know that upon arriving on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| probably the first meeting that I attended was at the Burlington Branch Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| and I wondered why the Eighth District, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| the East County Sector Plan was being discussed outside that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| I believe tonight the attendance of those that are here is a pointed statement to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6005)|
| 1:40:16| that the people that live in the area are being ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| I know of no other way to explain how I get there or why I feel that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| but I believe that's what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| We have a large crowd of people that are adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| and their appeal to commission is that this area not be a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:50| Mr. Chairman, I've sat here this evening and I've heard all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| I still have a lot of questions in my mind as it relates to this business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| We've had groundwater issues, slope issues, sinkhole issues, a lot of environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:12| I do respect the professionals that have brought this to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| I know them personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| I've been in their work myself for several years, more than I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| On the other hand, we have had opportunities here in Knox County that we have taken advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:33| We have not always missed opportunities just because we miss some that come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| Twenty-twenty hindsight is a great thing to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| But we've had opportunities, and I'll give you one that we've talked about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| And here's I'm looking down the road 20 years at Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| Many, many years ago, but not that many years ago, we had the same argument for East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:57| We had the same people come and talk about the same thing with the same stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| and the same benefits and the same advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| But we're going to --it's what we really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| We've got to have inventory, no inventory, no jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| If we don't have the jobs, then the community goes upside down and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| Okay, the county commission said, okay, we'll do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| And in so doing this, we had sewer provided straight to that particular facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| We had power provided to that particular facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| We have water available for that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| We even have rail available for that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| Well, got to get to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| So what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| We expand Rutledge Park into a four lane so they can get to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| But now we can't get to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| I've heard this story before in many communities and in many venues and in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:56| And I'm hearing it again at the end of the environmental corridor in the East Knox sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6176)|
| 1:43:05| We as a community have picked out what we thought is our plan for land use in the East Knox sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6185)|
| 1:43:14| The 8th District is not saying not in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| That's not what the 8th District people here are trying to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| What the 8th District people are saying is, is we had a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| We spent millions on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| We've leveraged resources for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| And then we've been told we can't market it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| But in leveraging resources and building resources and spending money on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| it was so that we could market it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| So I have a little doubt now whether we can market anything because we've reduced our market size if we accept the midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| scenario from 100 percent of the potential buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| If I'm getting me wrong, tell me if I'm wrong here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| We've narrowed it down to 20 percent of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| It's the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| We've eliminated 20 percent of the market, so we still have 80 percent of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| I didn't want to be wrong, so I wanted to make sure I had it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| So even in doing midway, we're eliminating some of the potential of that particular piece of property if we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:20| Then we have the other arguments that there are lands available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| And right down the corridor, there's the argument that there's even thousands of acres currently commercially available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6263)|
| 1:44:31| There's arguments against that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| Some say that it's in a lot of it's in flood plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| Some say a lot of it's on slopes and et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| But I also know that there's hundreds of acres out there that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| Right next to East Bridge is 100 acres that I know of that could be used just like that and could expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6286)|
| 1:44:56| So I guess what I'm saying is that we have a lot of opportunities, and I'm not sure that midway road is a missed opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6296)|
| 1:45:05| I'm not sure that this is something that I know that the Eighth District people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| and the community particularly don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| And here's what I'm really trying to say, and here's where I'm coming from on this particular decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| We as a community in Knox County had a plan called the East Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| We planned out an industrial side of our community several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| We put the infrastructure in place for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| We saved and preserved another part of our community to be a recreational, pristine river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| a place where we can go and enjoy the environment of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| At the very end of that corridor, we have one of the best golf courses around, a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| We also have nice neighborhoods where people can raise their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| And we still have land and areas that we have set aside in this sector for industrial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| But what we're being asked to do tonight is to move the equipment shed over into the swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6363)|
| 1:46:10| That's what we're being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| And the community and the Eighth District say we just really don't want to move it over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| That's not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| And I think we really need to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| I know all good things, if you spin it the right way, is good for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| And I believe that we have adequate inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| I believe that we have adequate land available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| We may not own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| Knox County may not own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| The Industrial Development Corporation may not own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| The chamber may not control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| But it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| But then we have to stop and ask ourselves the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| They didn't own this land before they started either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| But they acquired it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| They modeled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| They made it work because that's what they do and they're good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| And we keep them doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| And I would argue that I believe they're good enough to sell what's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| and what we've already set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| I believe that they're good enough to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| and create in the land that we've already zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| and the resources we've already invested in to make it work and make it viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:19| And I just really don't see why we have to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| and build another equipment shed over where the swimming pool is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| or where our tennis court is in our house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| or where our basketball court is in our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| We, as a community, have to have mixed land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| And we chose this in our prior sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| But now, all of a sudden, we've changed our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| And the people of the 8th District, I think, have over the years taken the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:53| how do we want to put this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| zoning in such a way to where we have had the landfills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| and we have had the leftovers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| and we have taken the industrial parks when it wasn't fabulous to have industrial parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| And we have given part of our land and zoned our land to serve those purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| And I applaud the people of the 8th District for doing these over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| So there's not been many missed opportunities that the people of my community have turned away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:22| This, however, is one time when they said, please don't do this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| We have given you miles and miles of land available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| We have given you land that is prior zoned that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| We have given you resources to do this with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| But for some reason, we as Knox County are not capable of using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| So we want to go try and start somewhere else afresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| And that's what we're being asked to vote on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| I think we have ample opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| And I think that in this particular case, I'm going to be voting against Midway Park or against this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6531)|
| 1:49:12| And it's not a political decision because I'm not in politics after this thing goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6552)|
| 1:49:19| It's a decision that I feel that is best for my community and my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| And that's who I represent right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| And I think that Mike and his crew and Todd are professionals at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| And I respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| And I know they know that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| But this decision is not a good decision, I don't think, for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| We have got to preserve certain areas and blocks of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| And that's what our community thought we did with the last sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| And to change that in the face of the resistance of the community that lives there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| I think is a travesty to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| And I think it's unfair to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| And I really don't believe we're going to have an opportunity lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| And let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| We gave the intersection at Strawberry Plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| and it's grown like nobody's business, almost out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| We've had businesses come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| We've had businesses go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| We have boxes there now where people can come and locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| We're right on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| We're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| We have land available right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| We can do the same thing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| I guess what I'm saying is that there's land everywhere if we're willing to design a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| around those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| We're going out in the middle of where our tennis court and our swimming pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| and our golf courses are to create an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| So I would ask my fellow commissioners one of two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| and that's what the community came here and asked you to do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| I think we're looking at a change in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| I know we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| I think that our current administration is fixing to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| I think we're going to have a new administrator in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| who's going to have a philosophy of economic and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| I think they need to have that opportunity to instill their own philosophy of economic community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6674)|
| 1:51:22| They said one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| Keep the sector plan as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| or defer it until we can have new leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| and see what they want to do with the investments of Knox County in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| I would ask commissioners to think about that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| That's all I wanted to say, but I had to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| I couldn't just sit here all night and listen to everybody talk knowing that, you know, what it was on my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| And I believe that there's too many unanswered questions related to Midway, number one, to let it go right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:56| I asked my buddy Mike Edwards here the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| I said, Mike, why don't we just test this thing and see if this system would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6719)|
| 1:52:05| And he said to me, and it was almost a promise of being emphatic, and he said to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:11| well, if it won't work, we're going to sell the land and we're out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| And I just said, well, why don't we just go ahead and test it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| And then we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| He knew it got iffy right then because if it tested it right away and didn't fail and it wasn't zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| there's a chance Plan B is like zero and none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| So I would still ask the Industrial Development Corporation that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| They said they don't want to put any more money in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| It doesn't take a lot of testing and figuring out to see whether that system is going to work or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| We've already put $9 million in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| It's not like we're going to have to put $20 million in it to see if it will fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| So I really respectfully would like for us to really think this thing through before we vote on accepting this plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6764)|
| 1:52:53| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for indulging my over five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| You know, I'm usually pretty long-winded at these things, but not tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| My colleague, Commissioner Briggs, said it better than I could ever dream of saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| So I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| Then I'll make the motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| Everyone's clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Let me just ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| Commissioner Armstrong, were you suggesting a postponement until a new administration comes in or something of that order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:40| or are you just speaking sort of in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| I was suggesting that, that we would allow it to be deferred until we had a new administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| maybe with a new plan toward economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| There's no reason to rush down this path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| I won't be here when that time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| It will be a new family of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| I don't see the rush in why we have to run down this road on this thing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| But I wasn't going to interfere with the process because a lot of people are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| and they're ready to go and they want this pain off their back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| And, you know, I can suffer the pain all the way through for the people of the Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| And I think, I mean, we have to look at the community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| And, Ed, you're going to have that pain to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| But I also have to look at my neighbors and my friends and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6865)|
| 1:54:31| And I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| I'm really, the word prejudice, I guess, is the best way to put it, of that particular corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| Patty, Joe, and I get in the car and we go down through there along the French Broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| and it is so relaxing and so soothing and so almost spiritual to a certain degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| Yes, to answer your question, you're getting me off on my horse again, Ed, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| That's what I was suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| I just didn't want to be the one to make a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| I think it needs to be somebody that's going to be here a little later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| I wouldn't be opposed to a substitute motion to defer this until a new administration comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6918)|
| 1:55:28| Larry seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| So Commissioner Wright made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| Commissioner Wright and Larry seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Is that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| And that being that this is postponed for until the new administration takes over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| 120 days, that would be the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| September would be too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| I mean, if somebody is sworn in September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| give them at least October, November, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| If we deferred 120 days, then the commission in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| it just means it's on their agenda at that time and then they can decide what to do at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| Do you have something else, Commissioner Lamb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| You make whatever motion, how many days you ever want to make, it's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:16| What does 120 days run us to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| To the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| So the 4th, Monday in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:28| That's four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| June, July, August, September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| Do you have something else, Commissioner Lamb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Yeah, just a very quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| I don't think anything is being rushed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| This was going on before I was sworn in as commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| And now four years later, it's still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| I don't think there's any rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| And I also believe that most of the folks that will be serving in the next commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| are probably sitting in these seats right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| And one thing I would like to do, and I support my original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| One way or another, I think we should have a vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| One way or another, I believe this needs to be decided today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| so that the next administration can start with a nice, clean slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| This was going on before I got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| I'd like for it to be settled one way or another, win or lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| I'd like for it to be settled when the next administration comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| I'm going to speak in favor of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| It's not because I'm necessarily, and I'll tell you what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| as I've sat here and as the weeks have come up, I've been for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| I've been against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| And I've been for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| And I've been against it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| And I'm not going to come out of my mouth, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| And I'm not sure what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| But I'm prepared to vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| But we're going to have a new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| We're going to have a whole new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| Yes, several of the commissioners sitting here today will be here in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| But there's a possibility that there's going to be a few new faces on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| But I recall when I came in, the previous administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7095)|
| 1:58:23| and commission voted to have a planetarium downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| And it was on the go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| We were going to have a planetarium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| The commission passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| The previous administration was all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| Well, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| We don't have that planetarium, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| And that's because the new administrator, Mayor Ragsdale came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| And by all accounts, he may be as pro-development as any administrator Knox County has ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7127)|
| 1:58:57| But when he looked at it and when the new commission looked at it, we went a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:04| Now, I'm not saying that the new mayor, whoever that might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| or whoever the new commissioners are going to be, are going to be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| I can't predict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| But I do know that they're going to have their own ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| And with this close to having that kind of a change in our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:27| I really do believe that the new leaders of this county need to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| Because they're the ones that are going to have to live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7173)|
| 1:59:44| And if we're still talking about $6 million of Knox County money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| and if the new administrator comes in and says, no, we're not going to go that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:55| and the commission follows, it doesn't matter if we voted for it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| I think we need to allow the next leadership of this county to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7201)|
| 2:00:07| It's too big a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| They may come in and overturn what we do tonight anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| And so, you know, I just hope that we can give them a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7214)|
| 2:00:20| That's what they're running on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| And they should be allowed to lead this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| Because we're not talking about what's going to happen in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| We're talking about what's going to happen in the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| And if we have a new mayor, they might be the next mayor for the next eight years after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| So they're the ones that are going to have to implement it, if it so be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| And if they decide to kill it, then they're going to have to be the ones to figure out where to go next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| So I just think that that opportunity needs to be theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7244)|
| 2:00:50| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part2?start=7256)|
