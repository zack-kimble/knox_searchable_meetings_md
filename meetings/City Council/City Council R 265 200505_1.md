| 2:34:27| I just, I guess we haven't had any community members come forward to speak on this or raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9267)|
| 2:34:36| any questions about this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9276)|
| 2:34:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9281)|
| 2:34:41| This is Gerald Green, Director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| The property is surrounded by industrial uses in Edge House Drive, Middlebrook Highway Railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9284)|
| 2:34:52| Highway Railroad, Interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| The only adjacent non-industrial or non-transportation related property owner is actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9294)|
| 2:35:04| the property is actually owned by the owner of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| It's Middlebrook Plantation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9308)|
| 2:35:09| The development of this property is commercial or industrial, will enable a trust fund to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9309)|
| 2:35:15| set up to preserve the Middlebrook Plantation, about 20 acres in the old home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| The property was actually rezoned C6 some years ago and allowed industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9320)|
| 2:35:27| but the underlying sector plans and one-year plans were not revised or amended at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9327)|
| 2:35:33| to enable that C6 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| So, this is changing to, the next three actions will change the zoning to a comparable zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9336)|
| 2:35:44| that before the new zoning ordinance and also correct sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| With that said, is it appropriate to combine all three of these together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9352)|
| 2:36:00| I think, let's avoid the lumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| I think it might be more trouble than it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9362)|
| 2:36:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9367)|
| 2:36:08| I think it's just sort of confusing and I think you'll actually be faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9368)|
| 2:36:14| Okay, let's go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9374)|

| 2:39:12| That concludes our agenda items and now we have, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| We have four people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9558)|
| 2:39:23| First person is Constance Evry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| Ms. Evry, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| Okay, you can start by saying your name and address for the record and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| All right, my name is Constance Evry, 301 North Charlie Drive, Nassau, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9575)|
| 2:39:42| And my concerns are really more into the aspects of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9582)|
| 2:39:46| I have looked through the 145 pages of it and the reality is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9586)|
| 2:39:53| first off, I'm going to take a pause to say Amelia and Gwen, I appreciate you guys all that you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| but I'm also going to say that you don't always have to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| Sometimes you can abstain to vote, so just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9603)|
| 2:40:07| But what I have realized is that just because you're educated does not mean you are intelligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9607)|
| 2:40:14| You all and many people of the local government here are very educated individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9614)|
| 2:40:20| but intelligence I question continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| The biggest concern is the 58 million dollars that were given to the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9623)|
| 2:40:27| You already know, I am not pleased to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9627)|
| 2:40:30| Especially after the most recent escapade of the police vehicle that we are still trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9630)|
| 2:40:37| to understand of the usage and necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| I'm pre-military, previous military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| Are we shooting RPGs and throwing hand grenades and watching out for rocket launchers and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| things that we would need an up-armored heavy vehicle of that necessity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9653)|
| 2:40:54| So really, it is what it is, which is a form of intimidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9654)|
| 2:40:59| To show that we are militarizing our police forces against citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9659)|
| 2:41:04| You know, it's a lot of things I could have spent that 58 million dollars on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| You know, for example, why not give it to the personnel services of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| That's what Amelia was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| Those are those trash can people, I'm sorry, for the waste conception people, other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| That is for the people that's got to go down into Tent City and clean out the port-a-potter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| areas and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9683)|
| 2:41:24| That is for the people that are on the front lines actually facing coronavirus day in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9689)|
| 2:41:29| To deal with the public interactions while you all sit at home in your comforts of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9689)|
| 2:41:34| bedrooms and other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| You could have given the money to Park and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| Y'all only gave $90,000 total to Park and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| And since y'all like to pilot things so much, you could have pilot with maybe AT&T and Comcast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9702)|
| 2:41:48| for some type of internet broadband service for the inner city students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| And then maybe even could have ran like a laptop rental program so that they can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| access to the online educational resources while our schools are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| We figure out the game open up in August of the coming school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| Be resourceful with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| I guess that's what I'm trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9723)|
| 2:42:04| You had no problem with giving money to big non-profits, which is still a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| Why does United Way need half a million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| They are a national-based billionaire organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| They are billionaires in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| They don't need our little tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| You could have gave that money to CAC, who's providing rent services right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9737)|
| 2:42:22| You could have contacted Stan Johnson at SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| He could have been providing utility service right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| Let's set our people up to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| As we already all know, people are losing out here because they can't work as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9748)|
| 2:42:32| Be intelligent with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| This is taxpayer funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| This is not your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| This is our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9758)|
| 2:42:39| And then the one thing that you could have actually spent the money on, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| How about put the body cameras on their chest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| You only spent about $750,000 towards that, but they're getting million-dollar raises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9769)|
| 2:42:50| Put the million dollars towards the body cameras that we keep saying we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| That's actually something we say we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9773)|
| 2:42:54| We don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| Insanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9776)|
| 2:42:57| Then you want to talk about improving community relations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| Well, we know that wasn't a way to do it, but let me tell you how you probably could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9783)|
| 2:43:03| How about some diversity ethnicity training for the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| You want to invest in something to improve community relations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| That would be a big start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| Let's be biased in our recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| How about we get some African-Americans, some Asians, some Arabs, some Latinos, and Hispanics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| on our police force in the next recruiting class, the entire class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| I think we've got enough white males running around the community as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| And then if you want to do something else, we got 500 police to like roughly what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| 200, 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| I'm saying it's 400-something police compared to our 100-something citizens, employee-citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| One minute to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| More money into employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| Y'all could have done a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| But y'all think it's more resourceful to take $58 million taxpayer dollars and dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9822)|
| 2:43:47| it into already an over-policed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| Y'all trying to be a big city with a Barney Fife mentality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| This is Mayberry with the concept of wanting to be big city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| We are so far from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9840)|
| 2:44:01| And it's these types of limitations of behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9841)|
| 2:44:04| So I'm going to say again, vote, vote, vote, vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| State representatives can control this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| Federal representatives can control this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| We have another way to get around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| County even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| Because Knoxville's in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| So there's ways to make you all do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| And we have to be wiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9858)|
| 2:44:19| And I'm going to leave with one message for my people that are listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| The power of the people can never be defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9862)|

| 2:44:49| Yeah, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| My name is Caroline Roecliffe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| I live at 1216 Raintree Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| And I'm here for accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9898)|
| 2:45:01| I'm here for people because people matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| Therefore, I wanted to address a public comment that was made by Mayor Ken Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| addressing this new facility called the Guest House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9906)|
| 2:45:10| Mayor, you stated that at one time, the facility has had about six to seven residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| But at most recent update, it was empty since tests had come back negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| This means that so far, and I still quote, this means that so far, we have not had COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9919)|
| 2:45:24| transmission among our neighbors who are homeless, which is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| Mayor, respectfully, there are anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 houses people in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9929)|
| 2:45:35| And this Guest House rooms 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| And from my understanding, it's empty right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| Most of these folks don't have transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| So how are we getting the word out to 4,000 to 7,000 people that are houseless right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9942)|
| 2:45:48| Mayor, you continued on providing locations where restrooms are for houseless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9948)|
| 2:45:53| You gave four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| You then continue to address big hearted and well meaning people to not help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| slash provide houseless people with food or clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| You advise them to work with the BMC, CARM and the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| Why would houseless people continue coming to those big hearted and well meaning people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| if their needs were being met by those existing organizations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| Mayor, you asked a great question earlier about what should local collectives do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| And if they're having to fill in gaps, the answer was to call 211 or to call second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| harvest, etc. directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| This may be more cost effective, which I'm all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| But how immediate is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| How spread out is that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9992)|
| 2:46:35| Again, people are starving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=9995)|

| 2:46:43| being ignored by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| Mayor, I recall that you talked about study disaster protocols at a previous press conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10005)|
| 2:46:50| And one of the key points of protocols that you mentioned Knoxville doing a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| at was transparency and communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| If Knoxville is doing so amazing at communication and transparency, then why have the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10017)|

| 2:47:27| If Knoxville is doing so amazing at communication, then why are organizations funded by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10047)|
| 2:47:32| coming to a small volunteer group that I work with instead of being provided funds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10052)|

| 2:52:35| And my family lives in the area getting ready to start receiving funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| And I can see, and it's very clear that with these funds and the development around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| it's going to become very much unaffordable for the working class here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10362)|
| 2:52:45| And y'all are just feeling the gentrification, just like you're feeling the gentrification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10365)|

| 2:52:51| And just giving $542,000 to a community empowerment budget, just giving Charles Lomax, who's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10371)|
| 2:52:59| great brother, a job with no power that doesn't actually do anything in advancing equity in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| the city, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| And we all know we're facing climate and pollution crisis, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10386)|
| 2:53:10| And just giving less than $400,000 to office sustainability of two employees, that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10390)|

| 2:53:20| That's not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10400)|
| 2:53:21| You know, not having clarity on the mayor's climate council and their budget and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10401)|
| 2:53:27| that's going to be made of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10407)|
| 2:53:27| That's not cutting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| No mention of climate justice, environmental justice and who disproportionately affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10409)|
| 2:53:33| It's not cutting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10413)|
| 2:53:34| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10414)|
| 2:53:35| And if all this, the $58 million going to the police department, while social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10415)|
| 2:53:41| are getting crumbs and people are dying on the street, while Park only has one employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| and no power to change the police budget, it should be Park who's making the tank budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10424)|
| 2:53:49| for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10429)|
| 2:53:49| That should be their job, but they're not able to do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10429)|
| 2:53:53| We see the police prioritizing corona funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10433)|
| 2:53:56| We see them prioritizing the grant funding, while we see garbage collectors and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10436)|
| 2:54:00| service workers working at high risk and they're not getting benefits they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10440)|

| 2:54:08| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| So we need a budget that actually listens to the people and prioritizes the needs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10449)|
| 2:54:13| the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10453)|
| 2:54:14| And if nothing has changed and the budget just as is, I hope folks will vote against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| this and vote for something, something better, something that the public can get behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10458)|
| 2:54:23| And I hope you all make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| Thank you, Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| At last, we're going to turn it over to Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10467)|
| 2:54:31| Mr. Roach, please go ahead and unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10471)|
| 2:54:35| You have about five minutes and he's going to start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10475)|
| 2:54:39| for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10479)|
| 2:54:45| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| First, I just want to say that the previous speakers, I'm pretty much in line with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10492)|
| 2:54:59| of what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| And it just reminds me of an old Parliament Funkadelic beginning lyric of a song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10501)|
| 2:55:11| And it basically says, free your mind and your ink will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10511)|
| 2:55:15| And that's what needs to take place with this whole budget process for the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10515)|
| 2:55:22| Knoxville that hopefully will have a large public engagement in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10522)|
| 2:55:32| But specifically, I do want to go to one thing that I think David Hayes had mentioned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10532)|
| 2:55:38| part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10538)|
| 2:55:39| You know, we've got that agreement where the police department and the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10539)|
| 2:55:45| are handing over officer-involved shootings, the investigative part of it, over to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10545)|
| 2:55:51| TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| And you voted to expend monies to bring in body cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10553)|
| 2:56:04| And also Park was mentioned and the role that they have to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10564)|
| 2:56:09| My suggestion would be as far as the body cams go, we need to have more civilian participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10569)|
| 2:56:19| in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| I don't know what it's going to take and how it would be crafted, but Park needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10581)|
| 2:56:29| play, since they're already in place, they need to play a bigger role in how information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10589)|
| 2:56:38| when a particular case comes up involving an officer, whether it is a shooting or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10598)|
| 2:56:45| homicide involved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10605)|
| 2:56:51| Getting that information off the cams and getting it reviewed and reviewed in an impartial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10611)|
| 2:56:59| manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10619)|
| 2:57:00| I know maybe I'm missing something in the process of reviewing that information, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10620)|
| 2:57:08| that information is going to be reviewed and then gotten out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10628)|
| 2:57:15| But I think there needs to be more of a direct civilian participation and review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10635)|
| 2:57:24| involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10644)|
| 2:57:25| And Park is the natural place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| So, and I think you need to really be focusing on getting Park more involved now more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10649)|
| 2:57:38| ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10658)|
| 2:57:39| And I thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10659)|
| 2:57:42| I didn't, I wasn't able to hear the whole meeting, but while I was listening, I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10662)|
| 2:57:47| not hear the term, the new normal, because things never were normal in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10667)|
| 2:57:53| And we don't, we don't, we don't want the kind of normal any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10673)|
| 2:57:57| We can't stand the kind of normal that was going on in the past as the previous speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10677)|
| 2:58:03| have pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10683)|
| 2:58:07| So again, free your minds and you know what will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10687)|
| 2:58:12| Mr. Roach, could I get your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| 2404 Victoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=10696)|
