| 0:02:58| For the Mayor's Report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| first, I'm pleased to announce some traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| and beloved spring happenings this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| as well as a few unusual grand openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| First off, you know it's springtime in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| when the Dogwood Arts Festival kicks off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| At 11 a.m. this Friday, March 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| many of us will be cutting a ribbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| celebrating the 2017 Feature Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| the Fountain City Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| We'll start at the gardens at Gentry Griffey Funeral Chapel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| in Fountain City at 5301 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| And then we'll follow up with the Dogwood Arts Opening Day luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| which is at noon at Beaver Creek Golf and Country Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| 6800 Beaver Brook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| So there's a ton of events this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| You can go to www.dogwoodarts.com to find out all about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| Another bellwether of spring is the Covenant Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| Knoxville Marathon, which is this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| The marathon is a world-class event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| with more than 8,000 participants in six races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| and it's our largest competitive road race in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| It's even a qualifier for the Boston Marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| But did you realize that more than a third of the marathon runners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| come here from outside of East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| So it's also an economic driver for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| They stay in our hotels, they eat in our restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| and we like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| So it's a great opportunity for us to showcase the city's neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| and our natural beauty to first-time visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| So I encourage everyone to give a warm welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| to all the runners and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Cheer them along the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| and relish Knoxville's growing reputation as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| that embraces outdoor fun and adventure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| And by the way, people are nice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| I had a guy come up to me at Big Ears Festival from Boston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| when somebody introduced me as the mayor of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| He said, you know, people are nice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| I mean, they're not just nice, they're really, really nice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| And that was his response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| I was like, yeah, that's how we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| So y'all made a great impression on the Big Ears folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| and let's do the same on the marathoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| So meanwhile, if you're downtown or driving across the Tennessee River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| on Saturday night and Sunday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| be sure to notice the lights on the Henley Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| They will be blue and green to commemorate the race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| and welcome all the marathoners to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| Okay, also this weekend we'll be cutting some other ribbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| At 4.30 p.m. Friday, March 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| the Sono Taco there in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| will celebrate its grand opening at 3701 Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| Councilman Pavlis and I will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| along with Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| and any other members of council who can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| The food is good. I've been there several times already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| My husband and I can actually walk to it or ride our bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| We've walked the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| So I think you'll enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| And it's also great to see a vacant and blighted building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| right across from the Roundup Restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| another great South Knoxville eatery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| But it's great to see that building converted into a vibrant local business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| Sono Taco strategically connects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| to South Waterfront Commercial Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| the surrounding neighborhoods, and the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| and you can get to it by bike following several corridor routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| So please try out South Knoxville's newest restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| There's actually several restaurants and retail places along Sevier Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| which if you haven't been there, I encourage you to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| If you do come Friday for the grand opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| be aware that there's limited parking on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| but there's plenty of parking nearby at the Baker Creek Bottoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| which is just down the road at 3700 Lancaster Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| Okay, a second ribbon cutting will take place at 11 a.m. Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| The Knox Makers Group will officially cut the ribbon for its new workspace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| Expect sparks to fly because it's a metal ribbon that we're supposed to be cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| So that'll be a new one for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Our Makers friends are sharing space with East Tennessee Technology Access Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| run by Sam's sister, Mary Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| It's all in the family tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| And that's at 116 Childress Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| So I hope everyone can come by and check out what Knox Makers has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| to create this terrific new workspace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| It's actually a community-oriented makerspace, and it's open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| Collaborations of craftspeople, artists, inventors, and entrepreneurs alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| So we're looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| You can come by and see displays of projects made using the tools available in the shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| like 3-D printers, laser cutting equipment, woodworking, and metalworking tools, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| So the makers are happy to share their tools and their know-how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| So tours and demonstrations will continue until 4 o'clock, but we'll do the ribbon cutting at 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| Then, at 10 a.m. Monday, I hope you join Chief Rausch and me in council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| as we help supporters of the Change Center break ground at 203 Harriet Tubman Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| We spent the last year raising the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| We've raised all the money for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| We're still working on some of the FF&E, but we're close there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| and so we're going to go ahead and break ground on the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| Y'all probably remember this will include a roller skating rink, a music mixing studio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| climbing wall, video games, movie screen, retractable basketball hoops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| and a pizzeria, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| But as importantly, the center will focus on mentoring and job training and entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| So, again, that is Monday morning at 10 a.m. at the Change Center, 203 Harriet Tubman Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| Please join us, and there will be a tour of the site as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| Okay, I'm almost through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| There's a lot of stuff to announce, but next Tuesday night, city staff will hold a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| to present the outlines of a proposed city ordinance on short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| That's like the STRs also, you know, as Airbnbs and other services like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| The public meeting will begin at 6 p.m. Tuesday, April 4th, at Central United Methodist Church at 201 3rd Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| That's right off Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| The city's goal with the ordinance is to make it possible for people to run short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| but to do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| We want to continue to safeguard the quality of life in our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| while also ensuring a level playing field for STRs and traditional hotels and motels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| in terms of occupancy and sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Finally, so that's that meeting on the STRs, the short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| Tuesday, 6 p.m., April 4th, at Central United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| Okay, so now we have two reports that are going to be delivered to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| First, I want to introduce two people who really worked tirelessly to make Knoxville a greener place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=592)|
| 0:10:00| That's Casey Krause, our urban forester, and Sam Adams, who is chair of the City Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| And they will come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| And then we're going to hear from Park, because we get Park's annual report tonight, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| So Casey and Sam, they're going to give us the highlights of the State of the Urban Forest report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=612)|
| 0:10:20| Thanks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| I think Will's passing around a summary report of the State of the Urban Forest report we try and do each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| So mostly what I'm going to speak about are going to highlight some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| The actual State of the Urban Forest report is available online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| so feel free to visit the Urban Forestry website and read more about the things we're going to discuss tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=637)|
| 0:10:46| In order to manage an urban forest, you first need to know what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| In 2011, the City began to inventory all public trees across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| in order to assess the condition of our public tree population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| Currently, the City has 65% of all public trees along our streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| and 90% of trees within our parks and public spaces inventory today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| Currently, the City has over 27,000 public trees within the maintained and manicured areas throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| This obviously doesn't even include the hundreds of acres of passive recreational space such as the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| Tree inventories are backbone for our city's tree management program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| Using Knoxville's tree inventory, we can track all tree-related maintenance activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| track important tree attributes such as the age of a tree, the condition of a tree, and location of a tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| and assess the benefits and risks associated with our tree population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| For example, we know through our inventory that we have over 170 distinct species of trees throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=707)|
| 0:11:56| No single species represents more than 5% of the entire tree population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Using this information, we can plan accordingly and continue to diversify our urban forest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| and minimize our risk of potential tree pests and diseases in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| Speaking of pests and diseases, we are now entering year six of our emerald ash borer infestation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| When this pest arrived in Knoxville six years ago, we had no knowledge on where ash trees were located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| or the resources needed to combat EAB because we lacked a sufficient tree inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| Using the minimal amount of information we were able to obtain in the last couple of years through our inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| we have managed to treat about two dozen ash trees throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| We have seen a recent spike in the number of ash trees removal in recent years, and I expect that to continue well into 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| Keep in mind that EAB knows no boundaries and that those ash trees on private, commercial, and residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=774)|
| 0:13:02| are also being impacted and will make up the largest percentage of ash trees that will need to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| in the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| 2016 was one of the driest years on record, with little to no beneficial rain during the last year's growing season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=790)|
| 0:13:19| The full effect of the drought on our tree population may not be known for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| and many mature and establishing trees may have been severely impacted, may continue to decline well into 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=805)|
| 0:13:34| In 2016, the city brought on our fourth certified arborist on staff and realigned resources to start our second urban forestry crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=814)|
| 0:13:45| This has allowed us to continue to respond to tree-related requests through our 311 call system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| but also allow our crew to run a proactive maintenance program and remediate many issues before they arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=831)|
| 0:14:00| We are currently working on the downtown tree improvement project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| where all public trees in the downtown area are being pruned to extend their useful life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| We have done an excellent job in recent years in moving away from poor tree maintenance practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| such as improper planting and the dreaded volcano mulching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| We continue to train our employees with new arboriculture techniques, always with an emphasis on safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| as we tend to work in one of the most safety-sensitive professions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| I have seen a drastic improvement in the quality of tree work in recent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| but that professionalism does not always carry over to private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| There are still many non-professional tree workers that continue to negatively impact the health of our urban forest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| through improper practices such as tree topping or predatory tree removals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| which negatively impacts public safety, property values, and the aesthetics of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| Finally, I want to end on a good note with several successful urban forestry partnerships that developed in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=897)|
| 0:15:05| In recent years, the Public Service Department has been working on trying to beautify areas along our highways into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=905)|
| 0:15:13| Last spring, in partnership with Keep Knoxville Beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| the city planted over 100 ornamental trees along the I-275 interchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| Also in 2016, the city approached Knoxville Botanic Gardens about using some space to install a gravel planting bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=922)|
| 0:15:31| to help grow large bare root trees that develop a very fibrous root system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| Using this system, we were able to grow over 70 bare root trees at a cost of about $20 per tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| Comparing this cost of this method to purchasing ball and burlap trees like we have traditionally done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| the city saves over $80 per tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| We took this project one step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| In the fall of 2016, the city partnered with an organization called Trees Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| to install these 70 bare root trees in the Silver Leaf neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| which is a Habitat for Humanity neighborhood on the east side of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| We used 70 volunteers for the installation of these trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| further reducing our installation costs for about $45 per tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| Partnerships like these are where municipalities are turning to to help supplement the urban forestry resources their communities need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| As you all probably know, the majority of our trees throughout the city of Knoxville are not on public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| but fall on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Urban forestry partnerships are ways of getting resources beyond just thinking about public trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| because the benefits of our urban forestry, such as clean air and water, does not know any boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| With that, I'm going to turn it over to Sam Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1005)|
| 0:16:55| Mayor O'Hara, Members of City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you for allowing me to speak on behalf of the City of Knoxville Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| Your Tree Board has, as usual, been busy fulfilling its mission of getting the word out about urban forestry to the residents of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1022)|
| 0:17:11| and advising the staff and you, our elected officials, on important issues facing urban forestry in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| Last year, the Tree Board participated in several outreach activities that focused on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| EarthFest is always a good opportunity to talk to a lot of residents about the city's urban forestry efforts, and last year's event was no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| We had a great time at WaterFest as well, where a school of students from the surrounding area came to Iams Nature Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| to learn about water conservation and how trees protect our lakes, rivers, and streams from pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| Several members participated in the 2016 Neighborhoods Conference, and as usual, we came away better informed about our city and its neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1068)|
| 0:17:58| We celebrated Arbor Day on November 4th with students, staff, and faculty of Moreland Heights Elementary School in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1078)|
| 0:18:06| We also participated in several tree plantings and tree giveaways hosted by our new community partner, Trees Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| The Tree Board has also recently reviewed with Casey Krause the program progress report that he has submitted to you with the goals and objectives of the urban forestry program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1094)|
| 0:18:24| and we respectfully submit to you the following recommendations for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Complete a tree canopy report with tree canopy goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| Complete a citywide assessment on both public and private lands, such as U.S. Forest Service i-Tree Eco Inventory Assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1114)|
| 0:18:43| We suggest the city consider expanding funding for this assessment and explore grant opportunities to ensure such an assessment is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1123)|
| 0:18:53| There have been no updates to Article 2 of the Tree Protection Ordinance in over 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| Therefore, a review of Article 2 is needed to bring its language up to date to meet current standards and align it with the organizational structure of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1139)|
| 0:19:08| The Board further recommends that the ordinance be reviewed and updated every eight years moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| Employ an individual from the green industry to assist the Urban Forestry Division in plans, review, and inspections of development projects citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1154)|
| 0:19:25| The City misses an opportunity for gaining monetary values from ecological services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| but not having an individual with green industry experience within the City Inspections Division to review and enforce tree-related regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| The Tree Board realizes the upfront costs of adding positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| However, the values of ecological benefits offset the costs of additional staff through ongoing improved success of landscapes required by the landscape ordinances of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1181)|
| 0:19:54| We hope the City will consider expanding funding for contracted services to combat emerging pest issues such as Emerald Ash Borer, Thousand Cankers Disease, and Bacterial Leaf Scorch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1194)|
| 0:20:06| These relatively recent insect and disease issues have increased tree mortality and the overall health of the urban forest has declined as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1206)|
| 0:20:15| Trees impacted by these pests impact public safety and often require urgent attention from the Urban Forestry Division, increasing workload and taking resources away from the scheduled preventative maintenance needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1215)|
| 0:20:29| In conclusion, thanks to the continuing work of the City of Knoxville Urban Forestry Team led by Casey, the urban forests of Knoxville are growing and improving every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1229)|
| 0:20:41| Casey's dedication and hard work has brought real change to our city through his careful analysis of our urban forest and implementation of the program that he has been charged to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1241)|
| 0:20:53| He is an able steward of the valuable and growing resources you have entrusted to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| And on behalf of the Knoxville Tree Board, I want to say thanks to Casey for all he does for our city and to you for his support of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1259)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Thank you. Thanks, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Oh, Sam, I want to thank you and the Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Thanks for your leadership on the Tree Board and thank all your Tree Board members for what they do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| We will review and consider those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| We appreciate you bringing them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| And I also want to echo what you said about Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| He does a great job for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| He and his team really upping our game in terms of our tree inventory and protecting our trees and planting more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1288)|
| 0:21:37| He's our very first urban forester, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| We created that position a few years ago, and he's really set the bar high as an urban forester in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| Agreed. Thank you very much, and I'll relay that to the Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Counsel, any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| And now we have our annual report from the Police Advisory Review Committee and Steve Fisher, the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you, Steve, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Hello, Counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| It's my honor to present the 2016 annual report of the Knoxville Police Advisory Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| Before I begin, I'm going to give a shout-out to two of the committee members that came to support me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| LaKenya Middlebrook is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| And Jerry Proom is back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| So I want to thank them for coming to support us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| You can't go without saying the highlight of the 2016 year for PARC was the hiring of Clarence Vaughan III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1352)|
| 0:22:41| Clarence, go ahead and wave right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Clarence was chosen from among eight very highly qualified candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| Any one of the candidates who we interviewed for this position would have been a fantastic PARC executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| But Clarence did stand out, just fantastic above them, and I think we picked a real winner for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1376)|
| 0:23:05| So happy to have him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| So if you can pay me later, you can slip me something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| So Clarence replaced Miss Avis Reed, who served over eight years on the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| before she was named as the city of Knoxville's senior director of community relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| So Clarence, you know, in stepping into the role back in May, he became like the Energizer Bunny for the PARC committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| He participated in the Knoxville Police Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| He jumped into the Knoxville District Attorney's Inaugural Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| And now he's enrolled in the FBI Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| So he seems to be making a career of Citizens Academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| But he's doing a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| So Clarence and Lisa, they updated the PARC website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| They've done a really good job of reaching out in social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| And we do have an increased presence and participation on the part of the citizens in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| So we're very happy to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Just some numbers to highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| In 2016, we received 87 cases, which was a decrease of seven from the previous year, and closed a total of 99 cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1446)|
| 0:24:16| We have to address some of the turmoil in the cities surrounding citizen police divisiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| We haven't seen as much of that in Knoxville, and I think that's attributed to PARC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| and the fact that we have good outreach on the part of the city and good communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| So that doesn't mean we're taking those issues lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| We're going to address them and keep the nose to the grindstone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| So I mentioned two of the newly appointed members, Jared and Lakenja, being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| Happy to report that training has continued to be a priority for the PARC committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Back on November 17th of last year, we had a one-day training session where all the committee members were able to gather at the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| Fantastic presentations by the staff and a lot of technical people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| and a lot of team-building on the part of the PARC committee, so happy to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| And that focus is continuing, which did start in 2015 when Mr. Reed began having training sessions at the PARC meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1513)|
| 0:25:22| and that has really helped citizen involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Lots of participation, lots of questions, and I think that's doing a really good job to help the police interact with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1525)|
| 0:25:33| The Executive Director, Clarence, continues to meet monthly with the East Tennessee Civil Rights Working Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| I think we just met today, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| So it continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| PARC's quarterly meetings were held this year at the City-County Building to start the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| the Beck Cultural Exchange Center, Vestal United Methodist, and Overcoming Believers Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Participation, again, has been tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| I want to give one more shout-out to Knoxville Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Ms. Debbie Thomas on their Internal Affairs Unit does a fantastic job of putting together the case files for us, very, very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1560)|
| 0:26:11| Over the years that I've been on board, I've seen a tremendous increase in the quality of the reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| to include transcripts and the like, very, very professionally done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| and a lot of care and consideration goes into these reports that PARC does oversee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| So I'm happy to give her another shout-out. I did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| But again, the highlight, what I want to focus on is attendance and participation has been increasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| and the participation by the citizens is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| So I'm just very happy to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| If you have your iPhones, your calendars handy, the next meeting of PARC is on April 20th at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| We'd love to see some of the council members there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Mayor, if you could come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| It'll be at the Amstein Jewish Community Center on Dean Hill Drive, April 20th at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| And lastly, I'll highlight just some of the more significant cases we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| Not particular cases, but the cases we've seen this year, 12 have been complaints against other agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1626)|
| 0:27:14| or referrals that we have to refer to other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Citizens will come to us and complain about the Knoxville Police doing an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| It turns out it might have been the county. It might have been a federal agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| So those cases are, in fact, referred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| Twenty were harassment cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| I have to report none of those were substantiated, again, thanks to the documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| the microphones, cameras, and everything that the police are using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| There was an injustice, failure to investigate, 11 of those cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| and, of course, unbecoming conduct were 11 cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| But all in all, like I said, a really good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| It was the 19th year of PARC, and I see it as being very, very beneficial to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| And, again, I've been happy to serve this past year as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| Councilor, Mayor, do you have any questions about PARC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| I just want to thank you and the other members for serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| I think it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| And then to the police departments, well, it's really amazing that the number of cases went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| I can't remember a more tense time between the police and the community in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| well, since the early 90s at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| And it's one of the most important jobs we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| and over-policing or under-policing can really be detrimental to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| So I just wanted to give a shout-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Also, the police department I saw a couple weeks ago went into Austin East and was involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| I don't know exactly what it was, but it got quite a bit of news coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| But, you know, I just think that kind of thinking outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Last meeting I thought the mayor was going to show the video of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| But, anyway, I think that kind of outside the box and really working with the community is so critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| because we've seen it across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| It can deteriorate very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| So thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| My pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| I also want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Thanks for your leadership as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| Thanks to LaKenya and Jared for being here and all the members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| Clarence, and where's Lisa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Lisa was here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| There's Lisa in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| We couldn't do it without our assistant there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| So thank you, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| And look forward to reading this in more detail and appreciate all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| Thanks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Oh, I'm sorry, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| On page 7 of the list here where you have KPD, lack of enforcement, gangs, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1779)|
| 0:29:48| Can you touch on that and explain what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| On page 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Yeah, under the list where it says gangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| You have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| One case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| You had one case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| What is that saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| I'm trying to go down the list and see where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| It's about midway down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| Under KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| It's below enforcing NOAA's ordinance and above the school crossing guards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| It's under KPD, lack of enforcement, gangs, page 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| I'm on page 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Those are the reasons people file complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| We list them in the appropriate category of the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| It doesn't necessarily mean that that is the result, that there was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1844)|
| 0:30:52| That was just a category of the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| I was curious because with the recent shooting, according to the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| it's saying that was gang related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| So I'm very curious about the situation with the gangs in the community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| It's a major problem, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| It is, but in our tenure on PARCC, it's more one-on-one interaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| citizen complaints against the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| instead of how they're addressing gangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| I don't recall this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| But, again, what we see and the cases we hear, the cases we review, are more individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| Somebody coming in to either IAU, Internal Affairs, or to the PARCC office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| and addressing a complaint, normally against a specific officer regarding a specific incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| It's not so much a broad overview of a crime problem that people will bring forward, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| Well, thank you for the fine work that you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Okay, now we're at reports of council members or committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=1929)|

| 0:39:51| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Counsel, this is an easement access for the old Standard Mills property and there are going to be a couple of little changes to the document itself that are simply ministerial in nature to put like an oath on there and perhaps correct a typographical error that I haven't seen yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2392)|
| 0:40:12| But I'm told we're going to make those changes with your permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| So I just wanted you to know that before you pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| And this is access which they lost from the railroad, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| And they're going to let them go over our bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2425)|

| 0:40:54| Jim, how is this affected by the bridge work and the storing of material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| Do they go on simultaneously or does this get delayed for a kickoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| In other words, how do you schedule that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| The bridge work, we still don't know exactly when it's going to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| I think it's probably a better policy to go ahead and do ours rather than wait indefinitely for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2473)|
| 0:41:22| We're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| The nine-month project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| There will be some overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Actually, I hope there's some overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| I hope the state gets going on their bridge in time for there to be some overlap, but we are working with them to coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| You're just pressing forward, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2498)|

| 0:42:26| Councilman Dela Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Yeah, I see Don Michelle sitting there patiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Don Michelle, does this all have to be completed before they start the work on Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| It looks like it goes through the end of the year, this site acquisition, relocation, all those things that get ready to do a construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2555)|
| 0:42:44| Or are some of them going on at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2564)|

| 0:43:09| So will this all have to run its course before you start moving dirt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| What Von and Milton is contracted to do, they'll do the negotiations with the property owners and come back with a set fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| and we'll come back to council later on with that amount for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2601)|

| 0:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2610)|

| 0:43:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2612)|

| 0:44:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Vice Mayor Griff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Mayor, we need to make a correction to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| It's Powers Street instead of Powers Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| So that's an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Okay, so first we will vote on the amendment, which is to correctly name the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Okay, that passes, and now we go to the original resolution as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| The ayes have it, and so ordered, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| 11G is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| for the sale of surplus property located at 114 East 5th Avenue to Patricia H. Mesa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| and Carlos A. Mesa for a purchase price of $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Okay, Vice Mayor Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| I guess it would be an amendment since there's already been a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| I would like to deny this for the following reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| That would be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Okay, substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| I'd like to make a substitute motion to deny this and would like to explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| This is a piece of property that's located across from the old city high school, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| it's in an area that has been recently renewed in terms of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| We not only have the old city high school, but we have apartment units across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| from there, and as you go out Central Avenue, all of us are aware of what's happening throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| The thing that I'm concerned about is that this is not an automobile or a piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| This is a piece of property, and to me, this piece of property is as important as the State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| Supreme Court site or any other property that the city has that we have ownership of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| And so what I'd like to do is I'd like to deny this resolution and request that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| city reissue this with a request for proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| In other words, I don't think it's a very good idea to have a piece of property that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| just being sold and not know what's going to happen, especially in the area where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| redevelopment has really taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| And so those are the reasons that I'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Also, the piece that went out to announce that this was surplus city property did have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| the statement that the city reserves the right to reject any and all bids and to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| any bid considered to be in the best interest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| But I think really what we need to do in this particular case is really have an RFP for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Areas all along Fifth Avenue are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| We have a number of developers who are doing work in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| It moves right into Emory Place and then right on out into Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| So, as a substitute motion, I'd like to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| Also, we do have Ms. Mesa is here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| Do you want to hear her now or do you all want to have some conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| I would like to have my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| I don't think that Dwayne's proposal is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| This was something that went before the Surplus Property Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| They said it had a market value in the order of magnitude of $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| They had a separate appraisal done by Pipkin Associates, $36,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| These folks competitively bid on it and got it for $40,000 plus some cost of the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| I don't see any reason why we need to second guess the Surplus Property Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| This thing has been acquired back in 2014, March 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| It's been sitting there for three years and we finally decided to sell it as surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| I think we should honor the bid process, the appraisal process, and the effort of our committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| I just wanted to reiterate once again that, true, I think that we did go through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| I think that at the particular time that this was looked at in terms of being surplus property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| I don't think that there was that much development going on down in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| I think it's important that we take what pieces of property that we have left in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| and make sure that they're developed in such a way that is most prudent for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| I think that having a piece of property and having it sit there for another couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| is not necessarily in the best interest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| So, again, I'd like to see a request for a proposal on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Is this located across from the old Knoxville High School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Directly right across, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| No, it's not on the corner. It's really to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| There's a diagram in your packet, and it's to the east of the particular building located there on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2967)|
| 0:49:37| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| Well, I think we ought to hear from Ms. Mesa and hear what her plans are for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| and let's talk about it, and let's hear from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Ms. Mesa, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| By council rules, you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| And I'll let you know when you're about a minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| That's our typical way of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| And so please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| My name is Patricia Mesa, 3930 Kingston Park, but the address is 114 East Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| Thank you, Mrs. Rojero and the councilors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| Well, to be honest with you, I'm just here to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| My husband and I like to seek properties, and we saw an opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| There was nothing specific besides having the higher bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| We bid $40,000, and we're here to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| Whether we're going to do something right now or not, I am open to the opportunities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| I did receive two phone calls from the person who lost the bid, which I thought that was pretty kind of like odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| I have lost many bids before, and I have never really gone and called someone saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| oh, I really want that piece of property because I want something specific to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| So I think today I don't have anything specific, but I would like to work with someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| I'm open to all the possibilities, but I would like to continue with the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| I think we did everything fair. I did request some information at the time of the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3077)|
| 0:51:24| They sent me the information. They put the bid out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| I do believe that whoever was going to purchase this property, they had a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3088)|
| 0:51:36| but they should have done it in a different way if they really wanted the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| But I think they went the shorter route and did the higher bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| So we got the higher bid. It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| I just think that they should respect the bid and just be serious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3114)|
| 0:52:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| So you saw the advertisement in the paper. You were advised of the pending sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3132)|
| 0:52:22| You submitted an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| And you had to approve financing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| You've met all the terms and conditions of the offer that you've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| That's right. I'm going to pay cash for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| It was like, I mean, if I had known that I couldn't pay the price, I would have never bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3158)|
| 0:52:49| And if it was a different specification, I had bid in a different project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| and they had different specifications that I didn't meet, so I would have never done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| But this was simple. I asked for it. They amended the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| They put my question in it, and everybody saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| And therefore, they should have bid something a little bit higher if they really wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| So I think the other person was $37,000, and we bid $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| Is it presumed that the person that bid $37,000 is the one that called you and asked you if you'd sell it to them or sell your option to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3205)|
| 0:53:33| I told him. Well, at the beginning, I didn't even know that we had got the bid because nobody had called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3213)|
| 0:53:41| Like a month later or two weeks later, he called me, and he said that he was probably going to be my neighbor in that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3221)|
| 0:53:49| and I was like actually playing a little dumb because I wasn't going to tell him anything at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| And then I called the city, and I started asking questions, and then I learned that we had won the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3236)|
| 0:54:08| I appreciate that. I agree that it's a strategic piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3248)|
| 0:54:17| You put it up for sale. You offered it for sale. This person submitted a bid and agreed to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| I think that's the process, and it's a fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| As we've seen with the RFP, there's a lot of challenges that come with the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| and we don't always have input on that and what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| We can have vague ideas, but we don't have specific ideas, just like the State Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| We don't have direct communication on that even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| I think that was the process. It was put up for bid. She bid it, and I would have to support the motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3282)|
| 0:54:52| Thank you. Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you. Do you have any plans for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| As of right now, I don't, but I'm open to talk to anybody about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| I might perhaps put it for sale again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| And I don't think there was even that question when I bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| So I was like, OK, I have the money. I can buy it, and I can see what is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| I didn't even know that they were doing all this construction in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| We just knew that we're always looking for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| OK. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| I guess Mr. Frost or Mr. Swanson, is there any legal implications we need to take into account with Vice Mayor Grieve's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3332)|
| 0:55:43| If you're just going to reject all bids and go back to a different process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| the city, in disposing of its surplus property, has a couple of processes it can use to dispose of its surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| One of those is what was selected at first in this one was the pure auction process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| You just put it out for bids and take the highest bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| And so that's what our administrative folks selected as a method to dispose of this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3366)|
| 0:56:14| If this were, for example, a motion to say not take the highest bid and take the second highest bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3374)|
| 0:56:22| I think we'd have a real legal problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| But we clearly have reserved the right, and it's clear in our ordinances that we have these available ways to dispose of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3384)|
| 0:56:32| And any offer to sell surplus property is subject to the approval of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| And council oversees the method by which it is sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| So if you feel that a pure auction in this instance would be an appropriate method to dispose of real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| because of the particular nature of the property, where it's located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| you feel like it's too significant to the development of the inner city, something like that, as was stated in the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| then you can reject all bids, start the process all over again, and use the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| And there's plenty of notice out there that that's something that is possible under our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| So I don't find any legal repercussions to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| You'll just have to decide as policymakers whether you do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| I'm not offering you any opinion one way or the other with regard to what your policy should be with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| But that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| But you can do it, and I do not think that there is a legal problem with doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| I guess my next question would be to the Department of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| Does the Department of Redevelopment see this as a strategic parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| What is the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Does our department look at parcels that come available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| and determine if they're disposed of via bid or via an RFP process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3475)|
| 0:58:04| I think in this situation, Donna Michelle, Director of Office of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| I think we did have a discussion with various parties to discuss this parcel at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| and it moved forward in that direction to put it out for purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| And I guess that's what you're discussing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| So we had an opportunity to look at it when we were trying to facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| if the old high school needed additional parking along with what that development would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| and also looking at the parking underneath the interstate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| So we were looking at that opportunity with that developer at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| Sorry, Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| You were just staring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Just assuming you're going to start talking, I forgot I need to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Anyway, no, as far as the process that they went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| and as far as having this as an auction for a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| I think that everyone followed the rules and regulations the way they were supposed to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| What I'm saying is that I really feel that the property management folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| are not fully aware of how important this project is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| or how important or significant this piece of property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| for what the development is that's occurring down along Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| And it's a vital piece of property that sits across from, as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| from the high school, the old city high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| and that I think we have an opportunity here to really have a request for a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| in terms of what that property could be and how it could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| And I think that to have a piece of property sit there again and just stay vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| not knowing what it can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| I think that it would be wise for us to look at it from a standpoint of what it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| and how it can continue to develop along Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| and how it could continue to develop with the old city moving out Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Councilman Lawless, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| I don't think there's any way that you could say this parcel is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| In and of itself, the parcel that's before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| in and of itself is not a significant size piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| that you would say, yes, that is a key piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Now, in addition to the property beside it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| in addition if you could get the street, Lamar Street, closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| and pick up some other property from the state, could it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| Now it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| But to say that this parcel that she has tried to buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| is it a significant piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| And I would think you'd say it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| It's a surplus piece of property that if you add it all up, it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| But we could only do an RFP on the piece that we own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| not on the adjacent property and the property the state still has there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| So I think that it could be, if it's assembled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| it could be a significant and attractive piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| But as it stands today and as the parcels are added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| she can sell it and these people can buy it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| and they might be able to assemble a significant piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| But I don't think it is as it's presented to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| I'll just reiterate, I think it's way too late to second guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| what has been going on for almost two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| looking at this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| an entire committee of lawyers and engineers and everyone taking a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| deciding it wasn't needed for city purposes, declaring it surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| going through the bid process, posting a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| She played the game fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| I think it's too late to want to rerun the world on this one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| It obviously will be for sale if someone approaches her with an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| She's bought it as an investment and an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| I think we should honor that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| unless there's something that totally upsets the apple cart here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| I think it was a fair sale and a fair bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| I'll call on Deputy to the Mayor, Bill Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| Yes, I think this is a challenging situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| I would say once this all started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| clearly this was treated more as a remnant piece that was a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| I think, in my opinion, it is a critical piece right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| given what's happened at the old Knoxville High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| and developments and redevelopment efforts occurring so quickly in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| So I would not understate the importance now of this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| to what happens in the area approximate to Knoxville High as it begins to open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| So that would be my opinion on the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| It's just things have been changing quite rapidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| and I think we've moved from what was basically a property remnant to a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| that's part of a pretty important puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| But it's Council's decision as to whether to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| I will state that, as Mr. Swanson has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| it clearly is made clear in the bid process that the city has the right to reject all bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3787)|
| 1:03:16| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| Let me call on Councilman Paul Mache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| Well, I'm going to agree with Councilman De La Votre tonight on the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| I know everybody's shocked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| I feel the love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| There was a process in place, and at the time the process was in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| this was not considered a critical piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| The lady acted in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| She followed the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| She's got the money to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| And for us to now decide we're going to change the game in midstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| is not a good act of faith on our part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| and I would not support a change at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Well, I agree that it's a tough situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| but it is clear legally that we do have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| And, you know, we've talked about this with other sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| you know, that this body does have the right to approve all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| And I think this is a situation that it got put in one pile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| and it should have gotten put in another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| And it is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| And the thing about it is, I mean, most of the property in the city the city doesn't own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| so we don't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| So the few parcels we do, and especially in a critical area like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| I think it is better to slow down, and I think we'll get there faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| And I think back to the South High situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| where that property was just bid out and it remained underutilized for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| So I would support Councilman Grieve's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| but I don't know if there's the votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| so I'm debating whether to move to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| But if anybody would like to say where they're voting, help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| We'll find out in a minute when we call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| I would like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| If you're still sticking with your second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| I would like to ask the law directors to verify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| if the majority did vote to go back to do the RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| then the Mesa family and anybody else would be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| to bring forth a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Sure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Mayor, I just want to say again also that as far as the notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| in terms of the proposal that was sent out, or the notice that was sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| it specifically says that the city reserves the right to reject any and all bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| and to accept any bids considered to be in the best interest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| So we do have the right, we do have the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| to look at a piece of property that belongs to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| and say what's going to be the best situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| Again, we're not denying anybody from bidding on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| What we would be asking for is that we would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| what somebody's going to do with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| and what someone's going to do in light of, as Dr. Lyons said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| things have changed in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Things have changed quickly in the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| in terms of the development and what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| not only in the Old City but down along Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| And I think that we're not denying the couple from being able to look at this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| and end up with it, or anyone else that might be interested in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| And so that's why, again, my substitute motion is to ask that we reject this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| and that we ask for an RFP on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| Mayor, if I could have just one brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| I don't know what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| The Land Acquisition Committee wrote a memo on December the 12th or December the 13th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| about their December 12, 2016 meeting three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| This is not like eons ago, and it was determined to be surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| and they sent it to Christy Branscombe, Charles Swanson, Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| and all the committee members are listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| This is a decision that was made in a recent time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| The free market will take care of its development over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| Charles, did you have something to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| You look like you were grabbing the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Yeah, so before us now, there is a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| And so we will, and we have a second on that, so we will do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| I don't deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| He's saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Please explain the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Okay, so the motion is to deny the sale of the property in this auction format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| All right, I do not deny the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| I'm with Ms. Mesa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Okay, so that's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| You said it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| Yeah, you had it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| Okay, the motion to deny fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| Five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| So now we go back to the original motion, which was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Show me the three nays, the three nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| It passes six to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| Congratulations, Ms. Mesa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4143)|

| 1:10:16| for each of its utility systems to the taxing jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| to the city and to other taxing jurisdictions in which our systems are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| In accordance with state law, each year council does adopt a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| that sets the amount of the electric and gas payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| and provides for their allocation and distribution to the various jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| I'll point out that the payments are calculated based upon formulas set forth in state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| and the allocation of the payments is also consistent with what's provided for in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| For the current fiscal year for electric and gas payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| which is in the resolution before you tonight, they total $21.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| That allocation includes $11.2 million to the city, $9.7 million to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| and about $680,000 to all the other taxing jurisdictions combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| in which the electric and gas systems are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| And those payments will be made on June 30th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| I'll also point out that although it's not required to be passed by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| KUB did make water and wastewater in lieu of tax payments back on February 28th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| and that total was approximately $7.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| So in total for the city for the current fiscal year, it's $18.5 million total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| and that is an increase of $1.1 million or about 6% over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| Thank you very much for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you, Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| Okay, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| Item 7J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a tri-party defined services contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| with Knox County, Tennessee and the Helen Ross McNabb Center, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| for the creation of a behavioral health urgent care center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| with the city to provide funding for the first year of the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| in an amount not to exceed $400,000 plus a one-time contribution of $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| for building renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Okay, council, we have three people sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| Mr. Wagner is here to answer any questions, but to speak forward is Ms. Vivian Scheib| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| and there are two people to speak against, Dan Smith and Carol Zimmerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| So, Ms. Scheib, if you would come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| Actually, I may need your phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| If I don't run out of battery juice here, I'll set you up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| Please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| and I'll set the timer and give you about a minute notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Vivian Scheib, 109 South Gallaher View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| As you come together to consider the contract for the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| I come to share with you good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| News of growing proof of the good investment this will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| News that the elephant in the room is no longer invisible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| News of friends and relatives across this city once ignored and not talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4389)|
| 1:13:17| In the closet, being set free as the promise of help is on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| Already in the last 24 hours, I have received six calls for help and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4403)|
| 1:13:31| I have received 10 calls, messages, e-mails, and texts of offers to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4411)|
| 1:13:39| As you prepare to come to the table to join the county and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| in the running of this center of restoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| please know the community is readying itself to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and do its part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4426)|
| 1:13:55| These names, 1,000 names, addresses, e-mails that we collected over three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4435)|
| 1:14:04| from all over the city and the county, in churches, at games, special events, stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4444)|
| 1:14:12| even going door to door, they represent the citizens of the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| willing and ready to stand with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| These names include organization leaders, medical professionals, business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| and citizens all willing to help their brother man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4466)|

| 1:14:42| from the community for collaborative involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| As you prepare this facility for use, as Helen Ross McNabb begins the staffing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| we of the community are poised and ready to serve as place-based resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| You are making a wise investment in the preparation of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| By your investment, you are also investing in the lives of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| who will stop going through a revolving door of hopelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| and instead they're going to be entering a season of a new life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| I thank you so much, and we look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4519)|

| 1:15:25| Okay, now Mr. Dan Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| Carol first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| Okay, Ms. Zimmerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4531)|

| 1:15:42| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Carol Zimmerman, 3100 Fairview Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| Mayor and Council, we want to officially be on the record, the public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| that the Northwest community is in opposition to the location of this behavioral urgent care center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| to be located at Ball Camp Pike and DeWine Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| The Northwest community was left out of what Vivian said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| The Northwest community was left out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| There might have been some, but by and large, the community was left out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| It was proposed by their buying the property in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| It's been three, four years, and the Northwest community was left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| Helen Ross McNabb, the city, you city leaders, the county leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| it's a callous disregard for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| We desire that the building not be located in the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| It's an O-1 office, and all of a sudden now that this type of facility can be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| We already have the behavioral unit there, and Knox County approved that in 97,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4611)|
| 1:17:01| and we were in opposition at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| The initial number of beds was 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| It has been expanded to 50 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| This is in their hospital certificate in the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| So it was initially advertised as a 20-bed facility, but now has been expanded 150%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| So that highlights our community's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| We don't feel like HRM has been honest and forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| City leaders and county leaders, evidently you've allowed this to proceed and to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| So we believe it is tearing down, not building community, not pulling citizens together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4658)|
| 1:17:46| but causing a wedge and division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| We want you to vote against this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| We support the work of helping those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| We have a great need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| We have a lot of elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| We have emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| We have mental folks that are struggling, loss of job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| We have a lot of—we just want those kind of situations in our community to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4689)|
| 1:18:16| and our emotional welfare is not being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| As a matter of fact, it's divisive and tearing down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| and causing great consternation among the elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| and we do have a lot of elderly population near this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| So consider the risk, the responsibility, the liability involved in a proposed jail diversion program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| and how it affects our families, our children, the elderly, every citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| We believe in helping others, but not to the expense of surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| of putting undue risk on the citizens of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| We just heard a report on the news yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| that an attorney for one of the killings that just happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| and I think it was Ohio but not sure which one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| and that attorney said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| we're pleading mentally ill that that was a mentally ill person that shot two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| So it's a great concern, the risk, the liability of such to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| So we're asking each one of you, please, please, please halt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| and let's go back to the drawing board and get this located in a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| in a place where it's conducive without injuring a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| and without injuring those around who are part of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| Right next door, up the road, around in Masserine Hills, Holiday Hills, Cumberland Estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| I mean, we've counted up about 18 subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| You have one minute, Ms. Simmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Thanks for letting me know that last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| You know, I was cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| So we appreciate priority given to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| We realize there's a great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| We have a great need in our community to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| and we would appreciate you hearing our hard work, our emotional help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| born, unborn, the elderly, all those that live and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| and try to make a living who've lost jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| We're doing neighbor to neighbor, life to life, one-on-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| to try to help people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| So we don't feel that we've been sort of cast as being non-compassionate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4821)|
| 1:20:28| uncompassionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| So we would appreciate your consideration on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| We plead with you to support Northwest community and our desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| Now, Mr. Smith, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| State your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Dan Smith, 1717 Gray Oaks Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| I just want to say that the community is not opposed to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| We're opposed to the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| I don't think there's anybody in here who has a family member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| who hasn't been affected by mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| and we certainly support the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| But the way this has been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| the way it's been undertaken by our public officials is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| Attachment D of the request for proposals lists disorderly conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| fighting violent or threatening behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| hazardous or physically offensive condition as the public order charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| This is further clarified in the RFP addendum in question 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| in response by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| which states that most mentees will have a history of public order crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| Violent criminal conduct may disqualify admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| In other words, the proposed facility will accept persons with violent behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| This statement is in direct conflict with statements made by the district attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| and the sheriff at a community meeting in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| which Mr. Lyons, I think, was in attendance for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| Numerous newspaper articles, editorials, television and radio reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| and interviews with public officials have made this very same statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| even as of this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| I don't find this truthful at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| Is this how Knox County and the city of Knoxville is going to conduct the people's business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4935)|
| 1:22:23| You know, it's a sham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| The fact that this facility is going to admit people who would otherwise be incarcerated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| the word incarcerate means to imprison or confine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| This is borne out by the fact that Knox County Sheriff's deputy is going to be stationed there 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| There is no definition in the city of Knoxville zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| for a facility that both jails and provides behavioral health services for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4965)|
| 1:22:52| The Helen Ross McNabb proposal on page 14 states that the proposed facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| will be housed in a fully funded crisis stabilization unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| and goes on to state that the CSU is a non-hospital facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| How can a non-hospital facility be defined as a hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| You guys are good at parsing your words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=4992)|
| 1:23:20| We've sent my wife an email with a very detailed list of items, about 13 in all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| which I'm not going to go through each and every one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| but Brenda Palmer, who is the councilwoman for the third district, did reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5009)|
| 1:23:37| Her response was from an attorney saying that they can't talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| Now, we're here tonight not for the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| That's going to be in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| We're here to talk about the matter before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| I find that very disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| The irony is that the MPC on March 7th, and it's in the meeting minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| it's on the website, the MPC met with Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5044)|
| 1:24:11| and their attorney, their architect, so on and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| and no one from the community was invited to give an opposing viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| Ms. Palmer is telling us we can't speak to the council yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| We're left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| That's very one-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| So I'm going to end with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| Projects that are publicly funded, which this is public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| I know Helen Ross McNabb is a private non-profit entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| but you're using public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| You're committing public funds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Public projects are supposed to go through a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| Highways go through public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| So even people get upset about TVA trying to trim some trees in their right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5098)|
| 1:25:06| yet here in Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| our elected officials have circumvented this process to build a jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| in a residential facility, in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| Councilman Dalladope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| You know, this is a troubling situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| I don't think anyone here has a concern about the city working with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| to put in some money for a safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| or a behavioral rehabilitation center, however you want to phrase this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| The question that's raised is exactly what is going to be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| I'm getting more information from Mike Steele in the focus in his article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| that there might be 18 crisis beds or 16 crisis beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| 16 immediate care beds, and eight detox beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| but I don't know exactly what is being proposed for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| I see that we have a Helen Ross McNabb representative here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| Maybe he can tell us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| But I have received, and I'm sure all of you have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| emails from people who live in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| and they're concerned how does this affect their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| and its safety or health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| So I think we need to explore exactly what's on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| not in terms of dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| I think this council is prepared to fund their share of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| I don't think anyone is against helping people who have a mental problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| or an addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| I'm not sure what you'd do for them in three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| and there's a nice question of what is the follow-on care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| what's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| but exactly what's going to be done out there at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| It would be helpful to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Jerry Vagner, 201 West Springdale Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Our proposal that we submitted in response to the RFP to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| Government outlined that we would provide for 15, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| 16 mental health diversion beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| So the target group of people that we're trying to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| are people who are identified by law enforcement in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| who have a mental health issue that they believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| after they've been trained on how to identify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| that they could be better benefited by treatment than to be sent to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| That's the essence of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| The confusion about the 15 beds is pretty simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| if you think about the fact that we also provide 15 beds currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| that's a service called the Crisis Stabilization Unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| or the CSU, as you've referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| Those 15 beds are already funded by other fund sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| They're in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| They're in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| They actually are currently at the property adjacent to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| at our Centerpoint facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| So it's already there in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| Those services are already provided for people who have mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| We believe that the benefit of having it under one roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| and allowing people to benefit from an existing service would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| That was our proposal to Knox County and to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| But you'll have the treatment facility people in that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| that can also help this alcohol or mental disability thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| So that's what we believe, and that's what we put forth as a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| We think that maximizes community resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| As you are all well aware, it's very difficult to get resources like this funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| so to maximize those seems to be in everybody's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| So that's what we will be doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| What about the assertion that this is like the camel's nose under the tent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| that the other facilities started small and grew over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| What are your plans for this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| This is the extent of our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| I can't predict what the future has in store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| but what I can tell you is the Helen Ross McNabb Center, as a philosophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| has scattered sites where we provide different treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| We have 18 sites in Knox County, so we only have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| and now it will only be adjacent to this one campus, if you will, in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| We're all over the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| We're on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Lamar Street was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| We're on Lamar Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| We're near the United Way building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| We're off Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| So we've got a variety of places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| and we do housing as well that is scattered across our community and in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| So that's intentional on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| We want to deliver care where people live and work and can access care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| What about the idea that it's nice to get people that you can sort of pull out of the jail crowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| so to speak, and get them to some kind of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| but the question comes up as to what can you do in three days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| How do you follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| I mean, they have to voluntarily agree to get follow-up treatment, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| Or do you just sort of get them stabilized and then drop them off downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| I mean, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| It's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| We want everybody in the community to understand how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| Three days for higher levels of care, that means psychiatric hospitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| that means the CSU that we already provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| that is the average length of stay for very intensive care for people who have mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| You can do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| You can stabilize people's condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| You can get them started on a medication regimen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| You can get them engaged in therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| All of that happens in three days, and you can make tremendous progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| That is the industry standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| When this was talked about a few years ago, it was a 23-hour length of stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| and the committee that worked on this recommended that this go to three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| so that we wouldn't have a revolving door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| that we would actually have the opportunity to make a difference in somebody's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| and we believe three days is the appropriate standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| What happens on day four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| So on day four, law enforcement has agreed to always transport people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| and from this facility for the services that we're going to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| That is a change from our original proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| but law enforcement is going to do that, in particular the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| You're not just pushing them out of the gate into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| We are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| We're transporting them too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| Nobody will ever just walk away from this facility who's brought here by law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| They will be taken to a very specific destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| That would either be their home, if they have a home in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| That would be a shelter if they are homeless, a new home that we would help secure for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| Or if there was nowhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| law enforcement does bring people right now to the front of the city county building here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| So that would not necessarily be a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| That would be our least desirable place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| We're doing that already somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| It happens every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| I wanted to get the thing defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| In terms of structure, you're staying within the four walls of whatever it is you're building in or modifying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| The current facility that we own now is a steel frame building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| We will renovate that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| The footprint will not get enlarged from its current size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| A church or something or a church property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| Wasn't there a church or a church property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| It has previously been a church and also a gymnastics facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| So this will be a medical facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| It will be very attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| I did bring, if council was interested, a rendering of what the facility would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| We'd be happy to distribute that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| But it will be very attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| We are already asking neighbors for their input in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| Tomorrow afternoon, as an example, our backdoor neighbor, who has the closest property to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| is asked to meet to talk about how to do a buffering for her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| And we've invited her over to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| We will accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| One of the changes the county commission, MPC, asked us to do is change the driveway onto the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| from the left side, which is technically, I would consider that DeWine Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| out to the front of the property, Ball Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| which would be parallel with our other entry point for Center Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| And we are going to make that combination, as long as the city zoning approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| Councilman Wallis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| Thank you, Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| That's big right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| That was a question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| So you're going to, you're intending, you'd hope to close the driveway on what I would call DeWine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| and move the entrance, close that entrance and move it to Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| So what other improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| You're going to make exterior improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| You have interior improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| About what's your project budget for that and what do you intend to do to that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| It's been a while since it's been used, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| I mean, you all have owned it for a number of years, but it's been vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| It has been vacant for approximately three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| And our intention is to renovate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| Thank you very much, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| Well, our intention is to renovate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| We have an estimated budget of $1.9 million in capital that will be invested into this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| We think that will be adequate to make it everything we hope it will be for its intended purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| It will be very attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| It will be very green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| We're going to take up some of the current parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| If you see this area, it's almost all parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| And we're going to take up what we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| I have enough parking to meet MPC requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| But other than that, it will have lots of trees and greenery and look very attractive, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| And you'll have those plans, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| You'll make that available to the public or you're making this available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| That's the first I've seen this, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| So go back to the 15 beds at CSU that you have now, that you're operating now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| And I guess the difference is, or what is the difference between what those 15 beds will serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| and the 16 beds that will serve at this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| The biggest difference is folks who come for the CSU typically are brought by law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| but they could come with their family if they were in some sort of psychiatric emergency that we would evaluate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| And then their services are actually paid for typically through the insurance company or through the state funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5694)|
| 1:35:01| People who are accessing the service for the urgent care center, we believe, will be primarily indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| A lot of those folks do not have insurance, and this would pay for their care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| That three-day length of stay for them will be an opportunity to stabilize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| We think their acuity will be less than the CSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| So it could be the same person, the same type of person, that would end up at one address or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| is what you're saying today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| It's a different door they will enter for access to care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| So nobody's going to walk in and walk up to this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| Nobody's going to walk in and check themselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| This is something they're going to be brought there by law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| They're going to leave by law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| I mean, that's in the agreement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Thank you for providing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| It's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Jerry, the present building that you have, is that overnight stay there at all, or is that all just daytime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| Mayor, that is an overnight facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| The length of stay there is, if you're in detox, which we provide there, is about five to eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| We also provide residential treatment there, and people stay there about 21 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| So it is 365-day, 24-7 operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| And the neighbor that you're going to be meeting with, how do they feel about it so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| Are they for it or accepting it or opposed to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| I was out there today, and I see that that backyard pretty much abuts the facility you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| How do they feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| I think Ms. Treadway is initially opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| She's concerned about having a facility that's close to her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| I think over time, as she's come to understand, these are nonviolent folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| These are people who have an illness, who need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| And once she understood that people aren't going to be milling around, they will be contained within this facility, I think that made her feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5817)|
| 1:37:04| We will have a law enforcement officer on site 24-7 just as an added measure of security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| We do not have that next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| We've never had that next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| We don't have a security officer in any facility that the Helen Ross McNabb Center operates because we manage medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5832)|
| 1:37:20| We don't manage people who have to be contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| And so it will be a facility like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| I think that's made her feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| I think it's made her feel like she can participate in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| But I think she would also say she'd prefer it not to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| This is in my district, and this has been talked about at that location for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| I called Jerry maybe three months ago and had a lot of my questions answered as the ones that have been asked here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5865)|
| 1:37:54| What happens to the people once they leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| What about the sheriff's deputy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| What about Mr. Edway's house that's very close to this and some other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| And I was pretty much satisfied that this is going to be located someplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| and they're doing the very best job they can to make this a place that will be fine, okay with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5892)|
| 1:38:19| And as I said after I talked to Jerry, if I lived in this neighborhood, I wouldn't be objecting to this facility at this location at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5899)|
| 1:38:28| I remember, it's been now eight or ten months ago, when the Walmart was going to be built there on McKamey and Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5908)|
| 1:38:36| I got lots of calls and complaints about the Walmart going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| But, folks, we have change, and we have needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| And progress sometimes is painful, and change is very painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| But I think that we as a council need to support this project, and we need to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| as Mike has come here I don't know how many times, to beg with us to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| So I think this is the time for us to do something and to approve this contract with the county and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5939)|
| 1:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| I plan on supporting this tonight for a lot of the reasons Councilmember Palmer said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5952)|
| 1:39:20| This has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| I applaud the leaders in the community for bringing about homelessness, mental health, drug addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5962)|
| 1:39:30| I mean, it's a problem that it's tough to say if it's getting better or worse, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| It seems like it's a squeeze of balloon and something else pops up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| But, I mean, sort of where I go typically throughout the city, you can tell it's a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5979)|
| 1:39:48| So I think we've got to take creative ways to try to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| And putting people in jail for short terms just really doesn't solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| It's not good for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| It's not really good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| So I think it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| The reason why I have a lot of heartburn was the cost breakdown, particularly the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6003)|
| 1:40:12| 60% paid by the county and 40% by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| And part of this is it may have been my fault or my misperception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| I had always seen this as a county-led project led by Sheriff Jones in an effort to reduce pressure on the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6020)|
| 1:40:32| And I thought we would be involved in capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| And, of course, we all know that we're all county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| And so my concern is are we taking part of the jail budget and shifting it on to the city budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| which gave me very serious concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| But this contract is three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| And then I started to think, why did I have that perception?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| I went to the newspaper and Randy Nichols, he estimated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| or this was reported in an editorial that he estimated the safety center would enable Sheriff Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| to cut the jail's $36 million operating budget by 10%, roughly $3.6 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| Well, of course, this isn't estimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| I talked to Mr. Nichols this afternoon, but he talked about the benefits, the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| I talked to Chief Roush about what his officers are seeing in the field with these types of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| So we'd really hate it if this body, after so many years of work, didn't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6091)|
| 1:41:39| So I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| I like some of the things that come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| We don't get an opportunity to negotiate them, but I commend the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| And I think it's on us going forward and future leaders to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| and see if there are real savings with the jail facility that they, in future contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| take on more of the cost burden of running this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6129)|

| 1:46:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Councilman Dallavanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| I see Chad sitting back there quietly awaiting this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| Just tell, how is this not under the umbrella contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| Is that only for household waste and not city-generated waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| and you have a side deal or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| How does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| This one is just Chad Weath, Public Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| This one is just separated from households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| just with the drop-off center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| We are hoping to get more competition basically with roll-offs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| because they're just hauled differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| These are all the large dumpsters that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| or all the large dumpsters that are at our drop-off centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| Okay, and that's what we're talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Yes, this has nothing to do with the household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| They have locations, but they have multiple containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| So you think of all of our parks that have large dumpsters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| possibly even rec centers that have dumpsters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| and then every recycling center, the five drop-off centers that we also fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| I didn't see a dollar figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Is that covered under the main contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| The dollar figure in here is roughly $210,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| And most of these is for the recyclables at drop-off centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| so some of that we recuperate back with the processing of the commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| The overall cost is $210,000, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| We receive about $12,000 to $15,000 a month back from the recyclables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| so that's about $144,000, I guess, so roughly about $60,000 net cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| Thank you, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| I had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| This year, Chad, do you see us adding another center or two for recycle drop-offs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| I know there's been concern in certain areas it's limited, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| We've had surveys out, and, of course, with the change in glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| we do see the possibility, and several have even reached out to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| about the possibility of adding an additional drop-off center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| We mentioned that about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| That could go up if there are drop-off centers added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6488)|

| 1:48:15| 12A is in ordinance approving the sum of $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| from the Parks and Recreation Department funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| and donating same to Fountain City Lions Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| to be utilized toward the maintenance and upkeep of Fountain City Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6502)|

| 1:48:32| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Council, no one has signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| so if there's no other business, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170328?start=6515)|
