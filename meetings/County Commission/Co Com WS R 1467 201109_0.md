| 0:13:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| We have two presentations first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Items number 52 and 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| I see Mr. Bagwell here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| He wants to do that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| So that would be number 53?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| Yeah, next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Number 52 is Natalie Ivey here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| Katie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| I didn't get confirmation if they were here from this week or next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Natalie Ivey or Katie Little, are you all here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| We'll hold that, but it may be next week as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| I didn't get confirmation back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Any other presentations that I know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Now we'll go back to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| As before, we have looks like 13 people, 12 people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=870)|
| 0:14:40| And I would like to give the priority to those who have not spoken to us before, which is two of those 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=880)|
| 0:14:49| So I'm going to first call on Natalie Gwynn, and then it'll be Michael Murphy, and then I'll start back at the top of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=889)|
| 0:14:57| Natalie Gwynn, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Make yourself known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Michael Murphy, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| We'll start back at the top of the list with Richard Cunningham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| Are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Please approach the podium and welcome to County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| And you have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Richard Cunningham, 1836 Bombay Lane, Knoxville 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| I'm a 20-plus year Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| I'm sure you'll be shocked to know that I'm here talking about the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| We've been talking, talking, talking, talking about this issue with no definitive action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| The problem is it's not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Let's all take a step back on this whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| We've beaten this issue and continue to go talk about it, talk about it, talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| But let's take health out of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Let's substitute taxation, zoning, annexation, any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| Would that be acceptable for any of those boards to have that kind of policing power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| I don't think it would for any of you, certainly not the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| But if you take the word health out of that board and still allow that kind of policing power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| no one would be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| So why do we accept that just because it's the Board of Health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| The number one issue is you have a board that has this kind of policing power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| They can fine or jail the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| They love to say in their meetings, we've not done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| But have any of you watched their meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| A few meetings ago, they had the Knoxville Police Department chief there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| And her main issue there was she was there to provide enforcement for the Board of Health mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| She was not there for any other reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| She was there to make a stand and basically state, yes, we will enforce your mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| If that requires fines, that requires jail, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| We are behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| That should terrify all of us in this room and all the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| Another issue we had recently about this board being unaccountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| the one way to contact this board is email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| I'm not sure you're aware, but the last two weeks, their email has been down for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| It took calls from me to Mayor Jacobs' office multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| That was finally corrected today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| The one way to contact the board was down for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| I have a screenshot if you'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Don't take my word for it. It's been down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Your own law director has warned you of these ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| You should take heed of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Some of you have said, many of my constituents are scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| Who do you think has been scaring them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Clearly the media. Certainly the media loves the panic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| They love that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| But I would direct you to the Board of Health themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Again, if you tune into the Board of Health meetings and watch them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| what would an average citizen think when they're looking at that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Well, they've been meeting by Zoom the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| They don't meet in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Is the Board of Health too afraid to meet in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| You all meet in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Many other boards meet in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| This is the Board of Health who should instill confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| yet they are giving the impression that it's not safe to meet together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| and still is a panic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| Across the board, the infection fatality rate is 0.2% to 0.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| Again, don't take my word for it. Look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| There are over 50 studies across the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| especially a major one out of California and Stanford University, that shows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1117)|

| 0:18:47| actually pass away from the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Think about that. 2 to 3 out of 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| I'm an orthopedic surgeon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| In 19 minutes, an elderly person dies from a simple fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| Do we tell those people not to walk because of the risk of falling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Of course we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| So does the 2 or 3 in 1,000 risk make sense to continue to allow this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| to have this unlimited policing power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Life has risk at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Everything we do has risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Coming here tonight has risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| We accept that and live our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| What we should never risk is allowing an unaccountable board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| policing power over the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Return the Board of Health to their original advisory status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| I'm not opposed to the Board of Health having their original advisory status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| They can certainly give you great advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| And sometimes they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Sometimes they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| But that was their original intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Advisory status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| That's what they should be returned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| If you can't return them to it and it has to be dissolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| then dissolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| It's not a board you're putting together now that could take that place easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Do not continue to allow unaccountable policing power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| You owe that to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1198)|

| 0:20:06| Are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Elizabeth Murphy, if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Elizabeth Murphy, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| I'm in Carson Daly's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| I'm not going to sleep it long tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| We know that the Board of Health's email has been down for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| He just got it back up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| I was going to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Thank you, Dr. Henningham, for addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| The last time I was here, we talked about having a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| where we would actually be able to engage with the members of the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| be able to understand the metrics that they were using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| to keep the mask mandate in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| As of now, I'm under the impression, possibly wrongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| that the mask mandate will be in place until a vaccine is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Will they then mandate a vaccine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| All I want is the ability to engage, to have my questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| I have emailed even when the email was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| I never once got a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| I've spoken at their public forum via Zoom I think three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| Never once have I seen them engage anybody who spoke at public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| and answer any of their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| How many of you commissioners have watched every hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| of the Board of Health meetings since July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Can I see a raise of hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| How many of you have done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| How many of us up here have done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| All of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| I have spent I think close to 36 hours watching Board of Health meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| I have seen things that enraged me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| I have seen things that scared me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| I have seen things that made me learn every one of your names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| July 1st, I did not know who a single commissioner was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| Neither did the 2,500 people in my group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| We all know your names now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| My voice is shaking because I hate public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Every time I do this, my stomach is in knots the whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| But this is more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| There was a Knox News article that came out I think yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| and they interviewed Senator Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| and he was talking about how there was not enough support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| to dissolve the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Not a shocker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| What is a shocker is the cocky attitude that he displayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| in saying that he did not think that Jason Zachary's bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| which I know most of you are counting on to fix this mess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| in the legislature, would pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| How many of you know that Senator Briggs had that bill killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| during the ad hoc committee meetings over the summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| If he is still in place as vice chair of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| that bill is referenced to, Jason Zachary's bill will die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| And all of you all can throw up your hands and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| oh, we really thought the legislature was going to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| I'm telling you it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| It is up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| This is a county issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Why pass the buck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Why did we elect you to stand up for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Please take that to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| Jessica Breidenbach, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Andrew Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| Please take the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1375)|
| 0:23:04| It's Andrew Flores, 1011 Lancewood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| Today I'm not here to speak about the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| which is a shocker for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| I've done a lot of speaking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Today I'm here to speak about something which seems to be a lot harder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| to speak about, something I don't really want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| but needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| And what I'm going to address today is the conduct of Chairman Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| and the October 26th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| I met with my commissioner, Carson Daly, a few days after that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| and expressed to him the way I felt about how the meeting went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| and the way that Chairman Jay reacted to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| and then wrote him an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| He was so kind as to send that email to the appropriate people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| to get the right answers for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| I'm just going to read the question that I sent and the response that I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| and then a few thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| So the question that was sent was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Did Chairman Larson Jay, by adjourning the meeting without a second to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| leaving the meeting, cutting the live feed to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| and cutting the microphone feed to the upstairs public section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| violate the Sunshine Law or rules of conduct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| There has been a lot of attention on this aspect of the meeting from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| and it has not helped him retain respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| The answer I got back was from Law Director David Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| He responded with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| He said, Obviously the meeting could not be adjourned without a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| a proper second, and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| CTV evidently cut the feed because Chairman Jay sent PBA personnel to the CTV booth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| to order the operator to shut down the mics and the video feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Clearly there was no authority for him to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| In and of itself, it would not be a violation of the Open Meetings Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| as there is no requirement for televising the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| except under circumstances set out by the Governor's Executive Orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| However, if the public were to be in any way prohibited from attending the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| then the Governor's Executive Order would require that the entire meeting be televised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| My thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| I think that there is a case here for violation of the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| I think that as inadvertent as it may have been, or heated as that discussion may have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| I still believe that there is something here to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| And the rules of conduct, I don't know if you guys have rules of conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| but what I would expect from the conduct from a chairman was not what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| And that concerned me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| It concerned me some, and I understand, Chairman Jay, that you are human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| And that you get heated too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| We all got heated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| I heard the stuff going on on that October 26th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| But I do believe we have to be held accountable for the things that we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| and the actions that we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| So I would ask that the Board of Commissioners and that the Law Director's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| open up an investigation into what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| And if they would look to see if there were any laws broken by the actions taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| any conduct or rules of conduct that may have been broken as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| And that they would allow the public to know what is going on with that investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| I think that's important to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| I think it's important for everybody to know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| I think it's important to abide by the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| I think about the example of the gentleman who came in with the commercial business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| on his residential property and the zoning stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| And every one of you could understand and sympathize with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| And his business was doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| But the rule of law said he could not have a commercial business on a residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| And though every single one of you felt for him and had sympathy for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| you still had to go by what the rule said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| So I'm asking you to do the same thing in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Thank you for all of your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| And thank you for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you, Mr. Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Mr. Andy Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Andy Fox, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Vernon Henry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Vernon Henry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| Kevin Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| If you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Kevin Hill, 37920 South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| I want to begin with an apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| Several of you I've gotten to know personally over these last several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| and I do respect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| And so I do want to apologize for being heated, for yelling from the balcony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1693)|
| 0:28:22| It was a break in decorum, and this body deserves an apology for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| Let me clarify and explain why I broke that decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| And it's happened again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| I don't think it will be a significant issue tonight, given the volume of people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| But when you all approve your agenda, and Mr. Sanders actually or not, I'm sorry, Randy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| Randy Smith, Commissioner Smith, made note of it last week or in the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| When you all are approving your agenda, you all are unanimously agreeing to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| and it seems to me that you are inadvertently, unbeknownst to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| because it's not really on the top of your radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| amending the rules that your body has set forward for itself regarding public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| The rules that you all have written do not give any limit to the amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| If there is someone from the public who's willing to wait to the end of a meeting to speak to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| your rules, as they're set forward, give them the opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| That was amended, and it's been amended again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| So I think it would be a good addition to your rules that when there is an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| to your regular order of rules, that that needs to be done separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| and not absorbed into the acceptance of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| And that happened last time, and it's happened again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| So I want to bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| That's what had me frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| I actually got to speak within the window of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| but I knew there were people who don't speak as frequently as I do that didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| and there were people who had sat here for hours, and that's unconscionable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| And unfortunately, not being one of your body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| even though I had spoken to some of your body and pointed out this problem that we were confronted with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| I don't have the ability in any other way other than to speak to you in breaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| ask you to pay attention to it, ask you to draw attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| And so I lost my fuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| I did, because I wanted a handful of people who didn't get to speak to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1848)|
| 0:30:56| If there might have been a more appropriate and a more successful way of requesting that in the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| I apologize that I was not thoughtful enough to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| Had we been able to join you down there, because I see several of you unmasked within six feet of each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1870)|
| 0:31:19| had we been able to join you and have the same rights and privileges as you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| that might have been something that could have happened more coolly and more calmly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Regarding the PBA, I want to make sure we make note of the point that this gentleman just read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| about the rules about public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| People, the public, are being limited to your meetings because of this social distancing requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1903)|
| 0:31:52| So we can give you a list of names that have been told at the doors, buildings full, you can't come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1912)|
| 0:32:02| I'm sure somebody might say, well, we have fire code rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| I think state law, the statutes actually would say, if you've got a crowd out there that wants to be in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| and your overflow space can't accommodate them, then you've got to shut your meeting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| and move it to a venue that can adhere to the size of the crowd if you're not publicly displaying it on video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1938)|
| 0:32:29| That's the backup is, well, there's video opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| That was ended. That was taken away from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| And so I think it's important to highlight in your meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| there was a window of time that people were turned away, the public was not permitted into this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1961)|
| 0:32:49| and your meeting did not happen in accordance with Sunshine requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Glenn Stafford, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| Glenn Stafford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Debbie Stafford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Debbie Stafford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Sherry Garrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| If you would, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| I live at 7900 Sharp Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| I hadn't planned on coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| I actually hadn't planned on speaking tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| But right now, the only way you can get into this building is if you sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| You wonder why there's been so many speakers signing up over the past few meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| Because they're not allowed in the building unless they are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| It doesn't matter how many sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| If you're signed up to speak, you can get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| If we got 50 people signed up to speak, you can get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| That being said, I'll get to my math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Every Wednesday, the Board of Health puts up their regional, on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2037)|
| 0:34:06| they put up the regional data for their hospitalizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| how many hospital beds they have available in the entire region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| This is something that they were concerned about at the last meeting about regional capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| And we were filling up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| I can tell you as being a nurse for 30 years that this time of year, hospitals always fill up from everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| And it's going to get worse after Thanksgiving when people have eaten too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| and they're going to have heart problems and they want to avoid going to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| because they're having chest pain or whatever symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| They want to avoid it and get past the holidays before they go get checked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| I worked on a heart floor for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| We were full almost all the time during the months of October, November, December, January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| My math, when I was looking at the regional capacity, which is over 3,000 hospital beds in the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| the amount of COVID patients took up 7% of that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| When you look at the capacity of ICU, how many ICU beds they had available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| 24% of ICU beds were taken up by COVID patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2111)|
| 0:35:19| Ventilator capacity, 12% were taken up by COVID patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| We're not being overrun by COVID patients in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| We're being overrun by sick patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| And that's normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| But we have questions that the Board of Health isn't answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| They're ignoring e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| I've e-mailed them I don't know how many times and I've never gotten an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| Most of you have answered my e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| But the Board of Health never has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| Ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| We have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| We want to be able to have a back and forth where we have a question and they answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| A few weeks ago, we had a meeting scheduled with Dr. Buchanan from the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| It was canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2169)|

| 0:36:15| We didn't get our questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| And it's never been rescheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| The public has a right to have their questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| And we need to be able to have that back and forth conversation with those who are making the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| that are enforceable by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2192)|

| 0:38:05| So I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| It's an honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Just making Knox County aware of this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| It has personally affected my family very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| And so that's why I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2300)|

| 0:38:29| Thank you very much for bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| Next item is number 26, resolution 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| It's approving a professional survey and engineering design proposal from Cannon & Cannon, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| in the amount of $122,200 for the proposed roundabout at the intersection of Hickory Creek Road and Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2329)|
| 0:38:57| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Motion to approve by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Commissioner Smith, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| I pulled both this, 26 and 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| They're both related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| I pulled both this and 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| They're both related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| So if Mr. Snowden, Director Snowden, if you would like to, you could go ahead and address both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| I just wanted to pull them off because I think this is a fairly significant project in an area needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| And it is also one of those that involves public-private cooperation between a developer and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2366)|
| 0:39:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Commissioner Smith, be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| Item 26, both of these items are companion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| One is a contract with Cannon & Cannon for a design of a proposed roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| The roundabout will be off-alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| It will kind of sit there, kind of put you in frame of reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| and base for me at that area where there's kind of a barn there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| We're going to build the roundabout off-alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| That will help a lot with traffic control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| New alignment on all three approaches of West Galahar Ferry, Hardin Valley, and Hickory Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| bringing everything into more of a traditional intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| Ball Homes and the development of the Seal property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| their traffic study identified that they were bringing 25% additional traffic to the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| so they will be partnering with us and will be giving us 25% of the proceeds to construct the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| The county will manage that project, will manage the engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| manage any right-of-way acquisition as well as the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| probably around a $1.2 million to $1.3 million road project in the Hardin Valley community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| that we hope to get started next spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| and hopefully complete as early as the end of next calendar year, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| So it's a good partnership and one we're excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Are you done? Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| Director Snowden, how many roundabouts have we constructed in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| The Knox County government's constructed, I think we've done three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| and we've been partnership with TDOT on another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| so we've probably had involvement in four or five, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| Okay. Are they pretty much a consistent format, the style, design, the turn radius, all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| I mean, can we not have a blueprint that's in place where we didn't have to spend $125,000 on just drawings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2491)|
| 0:41:39| You really can't because each one's a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| In this case, we're dealing with a blue line stream that we have to work around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| The design of the roundabout itself, you're right, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| probably could be standardized a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| but the alignments of the roadway approaches do require a little bit more work than you would anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| So in this particular case, we do feel like the cannon and cannon contract is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| to make sure that the alignment fits in with the constraints we have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Director Snowden, is this going to be anything like the roundabout at Midway Road by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| Because I saw that one, and it's really nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| Ours will be. I think that one's a little bit bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Obviously, their truck traffic expectation is a little bit more because of the industrial part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| But it will look similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| It will probably be a little bit smaller, though, in nature, just because of the anticipated truck traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2553)|
| 0:42:42| Was it a motion to approve, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| So there's a motion and a second on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Any noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I believe 27 was also pulled right behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| And that is Resolution 410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| It's approving a Memorandum of Understanding with Ball Homes, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| for the intersection improvements at Hardin Valley Road, East Gallaher, Furry Road, and Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| And a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| The next item is number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| It's Resolution 801, authorizing the acceptance of U.S. Treasury Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security CARES Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2612)|
| 0:43:41| funding provided through the State of Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury in an amount up to $6,979,335| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2621)|
| 0:43:51| for the period from March 1, 2020 to December 30, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| No local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Motion approved by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Commissioner Schoonmaker, the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Commissioner Smith, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Yes, Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2647)|
| 0:44:22| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Chris, I know this grant's for nearly $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| I know we've turned in close to $40 million for reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| Somewhere in the middle lies reality, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| I hope we get the $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| But I guess what I really want to ask is bare minimum PPE, overtime costs to the health department, adjustments we've had to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2681)|
| 0:44:53| modifications to our facilities, what – is this 6.9 going to cover that or, I mean, is it really going to be on the low end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2693)|
| 0:45:04| So 6.9 will cover the majority of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| There are certain expenses now that we're letting departments know that the money as of now has been spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| and, you know, we can either charge it back to a department or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| we did approve some designations from a contingency standpoint just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| You're kind of hard to hear, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| So we did – so we put some money in designations for contingency for certain things that may come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2732)|
| 0:45:41| We have told departments on some bigger items that the funding is no longer there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| and we have to come up with some sort of other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| And so, you know, for certain PPEs and things like that, yeah, I mean, we can help to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| And, you know, the state may come along and provide more – some additional funding, a separate round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2756)|
| 0:46:05| You know, I think we'll get more than the 6.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| Do I think we'll get close to our number of 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Ultimately, as we talked about at the Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| when they opened it up for payroll related to public health and public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2778)|
| 0:46:27| I mean, it's just going to drive that number up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| And so the key to submit early was to see what funds would be left about from other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2789)|
| 0:46:39| or counties that didn't spend it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| You know, we'll see what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| You know, I'm comfortable getting the 6.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| But, you know, like for us, you know, we've moved expenses back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| because they'll tell you that it is allowable, then come back and say it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| And so I was talking to Perry and we moved about $2 million back in 20 from general grants fund back to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2818)|
| 0:47:08| And so we're having a moving target in 20 and 21 because of CARES Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| Okay, and that kind of goes along the line where I wanted to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| I would imagine we've done most of our facility changes to be as compliant and safe as we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2838)|
| 0:47:26| But have we given any appropriation or thought or budget to if this does continue on another year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2846)|
| 0:47:35| what we're going to need for mask, hand sanitizers, and continued overtime labor in the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| And do you see anything coming to help with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| As it relates to the health department, there's also a grant that we got from the CDC that's like $7.1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2864)|
| 0:47:53| that helps to offset some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| And I think that runs through March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Does that seem right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Through March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| And so that helps there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| And, you know, we'll wait to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| The feds may pass some additional things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| If not, I mean, we've ultimately, because of some of these expenses that can be charged to CARES Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| it can free up certain monies to cover PPEs and things like that that come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| Good question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Is a vaccination program provider agreement sets forth requirements for participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| Is that mandatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Is that one of those is going to be a mandatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| Maybe Dr. Buchanan can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| I don't think we're on the same resolution right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| We're on number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| We haven't gotten to that one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| For the record, do we do a vote, voice vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| or can we have to do a roll call since it's $6 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| We can do a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| We can do a roll call if you'd like to request one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| No, I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Usually in finance we do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| It's not a requirement for a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| It's a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Just want to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Any discussion on this item number 35?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2971)|

| 0:49:39| Next item is number 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| It's resolution 901,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| approving various amendments to the Knox County Commission rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| rule one, section O, entitled public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| I'll look to the chair of the rules committee for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| You wanted a motion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| I made a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Motion to approve by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| I appreciate the rules committee getting together and doing these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| I did have a question for the law directors that pertain to Mr. Hill's question before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3025)|
| 0:50:34| Should we be suspending our rules to change our public forum, doing that in a separate motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| I couldn't quite hear you say again on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| I wanted to go back to the public speaker, Mr. Hill's question about if we change public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3044)|
| 0:50:53| Should we be voting on it separately to suspend our rules if we're going to limit public forum on any given night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3053)|
| 0:51:03| If you're going to ‑‑ if you got ‑‑ this is a rule change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| I'm just asking outside of that since we're back to rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| I didn't want to comment on it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| I wanted to wait until we got to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| That's purely policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| You can suspend your rules by a three‑fourths vote if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| But that's up to this board if they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| And that's purely policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| But can you suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Yes, it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| You can do it by a three‑quarter vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| So you're saying by Robert's rules and our own commission rules, we don't have to suspend the rules to change the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| As long as we vote in a super majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Super majority would carry it on a suspension of the rules issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| If I could chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| The last time we had this discussion, Director Book said essentially at the beginning if you were to get an ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3114)|
| 0:52:01| if you say without objection, this is how we're going to proceed with our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| If you were to get an objection, then you could pull out whatever the objection is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| You could vote on it specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| But it's still within a proper order to sort of say here's ‑‑ does the will of the body agree with the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3130)|
| 0:52:19| So ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Since he asked the question, if that was an extra step we needed to add to the procedure to do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| Any other discussion on item number 39?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| We have a motion from Commissioner Bussler, second from Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3158)|

| 0:52:41| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Item number 40, resolution 902 is amending the Knox County Commission rules, rule one, section B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| entitled order of business to number one, add places on the agenda for presentations and budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3171)|
| 0:52:58| Number two, move public forum after presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| And number three, provide that public forum at the beginning of the commission meeting is for agenda items only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| and public forum at the end of the commission meeting is for open topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| Make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| Motion to approve, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| Second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Sorry, I couldn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| Please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Madam Clerk, number 41, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Item 41 is resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| It's amending the Knox County Commission rules, rule seven, section F, entitled applicant attendance required for action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3216)|
| 0:53:44| to strongly encourage and not require attendance at the zoning session by the applicant or by representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3224)|
| 0:53:53| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Motion approved by Commissioner Daley, second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Commissioner Smith, and then I'll go to Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Commissioner Daley, I wanted to ask you about the intent of this because the caption is somewhat misleading, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| From reading through this, I believe the purpose you brought this is because originally it says attendance is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3252)|
| 0:54:20| and then in our rules we have the ability to take action of withdrawal if the people aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| Is that the purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| Well, the main purpose is that when the applicant goes before Knoxville and Knox County Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| they are told if it's a rezoning, they come before County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| So that's one time there's notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Sometimes they'll come for the following month and they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| We're kind enough to give them, move them to the back of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| but if they're not at the end of the agenda, we send them a letter stating, certified letter by mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| that they are required or they should be at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| The problem is that we've had certain situations we've had the public come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| and to find out that the applicant didn't show, and this happened recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| Actually, this is, I'm not going to use that word, three strikes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| because the applicant will know at Knoxville and Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| that they are required to come before County Commission the following month to ask for or get approval for their request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3330)|
| 0:55:38| or ask for, if it's denied, ask for, to be overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3338)|
| 0:55:47| But if they don't show up, there's a letter, like I say, there's a letter sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| and then on the third month, if they're not here, then that's when we can say that they deemed that they did not come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| and it will be automatically withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| Does that answer your question, hopefully?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Yeah, I'm just wondering what is it really changing about what our current rule is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| What is it really changing from what our current rule is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| Well, it changed the last time when Robbie Toole didn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| Was Daniel here, Daniel Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| Daniel may be able to help me out a little bit more on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| If I could weigh in while Daniel sits down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| I believe it also gives us a mechanism to say if you don't show up after a certain amount of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| then we can actually take action where it didn't have that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| But attendance is required, so you can't take action if they're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| And that's what I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| That's what I was asking by putting the strongly recommended language in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| Does it give us the ability on the back end when they haven't met the hurdles to take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| even though they're not there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| That's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Daniel, you want to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| The current rule says that the attendance of the applicant shall be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| Of course, that's not the case because when they don't show up under the current rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| they don't show up twice, then we're going to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| We're going to deem their petition withdrawn or their application withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| This clears up that discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| The first sentence takes away the first sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| It strongly recommends that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| But the operation of the rule, the applicant will still be required to attend in order for the commission to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3445)|
| 0:57:33| because the first time they don't attend, they get pumped to the back of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| The second time they don't attend, then it's deemed withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| I had the same questions, and I think they've all been cleared up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| If the person doesn't, let me ask you this, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| If the person doesn't show up the first time, doesn't give us a response, doesn't respond to us at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| the public shows up, they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| Now, we say, okay, we'll move this to next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| If the applicant calls in, say, the week before a commission meeting and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| I want to postpone this for 30, 60, or 90 days, and we let them do that, that's correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3498)|
| 0:58:28| But is that curing the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| What you're talking about is making the public come down here without due notification that it won't be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| I think you've done that in the past where an applicant has requested the postponement a week before the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3518)|
| 0:58:47| It can be marked on the agenda that it's postponed at the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| The rule really applies when there's no communication and the applicant doesn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| Communication, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I'll make sure that was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| Is there any further discussion on item number 41?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Law Director, in state ordinances, they always use the word shall, meaning that you must absolutely, there is no gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3550)|
| 0:59:21| They've gone from absolutely no gray area to a gray area with the word strongly encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3561)|
| 0:59:30| So they're required as part of a rezoning, once they are approved at MPC or NOx planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3570)|
| 0:59:40| they're required for final dispensation by appearing before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| So they shall have to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Why would we want to say we strongly recommend you be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| Well, so if you read on down, the second sentence in that paragraph says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| if the applicant doesn't show up essentially at the first time that item is read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| they're going to be bumped to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| If they're not there at the end of the agenda, then they get bumped to the next meeting by operation of the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| And if they don't show up at the subsequent meeting the second time that it's appeared on your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| then it's going to be deemed withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| So the operation of that requires the applicant to show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| but it removes the discrepancy with the first sentence there that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| attendance shall be required to act on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| because ultimately if they don't show up twice, you're going to deem it withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| There was a conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| First sentence removes the conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Okay. And why withdrawn instead of denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| Well, so there's also a commission rule that says if the application is denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| then you're going to have to wait 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| This gives a little bit more flexibility to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| And ultimately the decision about what to do in that circumstance is up to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| The commission can also always make another decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| If the applicant fails to show up twice, it can be brought for a vote and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| well, we're going to give them a third chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| You could give them a third chance and then make another determination when they don't show up a third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| But ultimately the decision is always in the hands of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3684)|
| 1:01:32| Unless the commission determines otherwise is the last part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| Okay. Are we obligated by state law to give them an extended period of time to approve or deny a zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| No, and the state law doesn't require the presence of the applicant at the meeting for any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| It's just been the policy of this body that they have the attendance of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Okay. I think I can try to make this as simple as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| Our rule before said that you had to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| Yet we had a rule that said if you don't show up enough, we can take action, which is contradicting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| So we changed the rule to say we strongly urge you to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| Then if we get to the point that you haven't shown up, we're free to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| Thank you for your excellent summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| We have a first by Commissioner Daly and second by Commissioner Bustler on item number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| I just have a quick question, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| The three resolutions we just passed, when will those become effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3772)|
| 1:03:05| They should become effective upon passage if this body passes them at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3785)|
| 1:03:13| Next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| We didn't defer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| They would go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| We passed it tonight, so would they be in effect next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| No, this is not a voting session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| We passed them to go on to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| So our affirmative tonight puts them on consent for next week, and then we would put them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| So any rule effect would begin in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| We've also, just as a housekeeping note, we have asked the IT department, I believe we're meeting with them this week or soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3821)|
| 1:03:48| to create a new page and a new format on our website that outlines public forum rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3828)|
| 1:03:56| and anything related to signing up to speak would be very clear and evident to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| Let me qualify that it would be effective upon passage subject to the mayor's right within 10 days to veto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3842)|
| 1:04:13| Madam Clerk, next item, we're going to move to the two resolutions that do not have a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| This is 606 and 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| We'll start with 606.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Resolution 606 is approving a CDC COVID-19 designation program provider agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| for the Knox County Health Department to receive and administer COVID-19 vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| Entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Motion to approve without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| Motion to move forward without recommendation by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| seconded by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| Open the floor for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| I imagine we would like to hear from Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Commissioner Daley, if you would like to start us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| I know we can hear from Dr. Buchanan, but first before I ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| because you'll probably answer the question before I ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| If you could state your name and department for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| And I cheated because you already asked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| So this is required for us to be able to receive, the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| to be able to receive the vaccine to give to people voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| So any doctor or hospital or health department that wants to receive COVID vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| to administer to the public voluntarily must sign this agreement with the CDC in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| We already do almost everything on here with the exception of the ultra cold storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| We don't have that currently actively in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| but we're out working on getting that in place because this vaccine has a kind of different storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| But we already do all of these things routinely with vaccine because we handle, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| thousands and thousands of doses of vaccine every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| So I'm very comfortable putting this in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| It's similar to an agreement we have in place to receive vaccinations for the vaccines for children program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| which helps to vaccinate children who are either uninsured or on TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| I'm happy to answer any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| This is a question for Director Boak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| Have you, because obviously I just got this just a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| but there's no there's nothing in here that there could be like a loophole to make anything mandatory or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| just to play on top of what Commissioner Daly was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| No, there aren't any loopholes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| And the health department, Dr. Buchanan, as she said, we're already doing this for other vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| This is a separate contract sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| It's a good contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| They'll do exactly everything that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| And it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| She needs to get those vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Just out of curiosity, is there any information on timeframe on vaccines coming in at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| And let me back up and apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| I do apologize that you guys got this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| The reason you got this today is we were told at the end of last week to be prepared to receive vaccine potentially late November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| early December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| So we wanted to have all this in place to be ready when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| So there is a reason to expedite this and get it on, not wait for December to put it on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| In theory, once those vaccines land, would they be readily available to give out to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| No, they won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| They'll be given out based on CDC and Tennessee Department of Health guidelines in a tiered fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| starting with medical providers, first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| And I can't remember the entire list, but that's the primary folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| The primary folks we'll be focusing on, as well as long-term care providers and others who provide services such as that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4068)|
| 1:07:56| who are putting themselves at risk of getting COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| And then it will be tiered into age groups and people who have medical conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| So there's a pretty state release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Did the state release their plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| The state released their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| We'll be following that plan very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| And that will be posted on your website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| It can be posted on our website, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Hey, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| I'm all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| Doing good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Is this the vaccine that's going to have a dry ice requirement for storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| So this is a vaccine that has an ultra-cold storage requirement, minus 90 degrees Celsius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| 70?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Minus 70 degrees Celsius, which is still pretty cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| So it can either be stored with dry ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| It can be stored in the container it's shipped in that requires dry ice pellet to be changed periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| We're looking into getting an ultra-cold freezer so that we don't have to mess with the dry ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| So we could just store it in that freezer and make it a little easier and actually increase its shelf life a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| So it'll last a little bit longer that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| So we don't really have an idea of what kind of volume of this vaccine we'll be receiving at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| So what I'm getting at is do you need any assistance, any more budgeting for dry ice or freezers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| Because if this becomes available, I want us to be able to get as much of our hands on it as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| At this time, we don't believe we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| In addition to the – I'm looking at Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| The money you had was not our – you approved approximately $7 million for us for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| We'll be using that money to secure the dry ice if we decide to go that route and the other storage things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| The vaccine will come with syringes and all that stuff to be able to give the vaccine with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| So we're working on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| Right now, what we know is that the vaccine will come in 975 – what a weird number – 975 allotments in a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4197)|
| 1:10:08| We have the capacity to store that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| They have to be used within a certain amount of time, depending on how you store the vaccine itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| which is why we're looking to get those ultra-cold freezers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| If you leave it in the box it comes in, which is an option, you have to change out the pellets, and you have to use it within 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| So that's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| So we'll be starting – we're already talking to our first responder partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| Hospitals will also be receiving this directly from the vendor – or not the vendor, directly from the distributor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| So that will be going straight to them, not through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| Have you located a freezer? Because I'd imagine this is something that's about to become in very high demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| We have talked to some partners who have them, and are actually asking if we could borrow one of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| And we're also looking at purchasing one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| There are other vaccines coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| And because this one has such really rigorous storage requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| I would imagine when those that are easier to store become available, we'll be getting those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| So I don't want to put too much money in the super-cold storage, but I want to have adequate storage so that we can meet the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Out of respect for you, I believe you're saying some things I want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| This is ridiculous outside. Is there any way we can pause and have PBA go out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4285)|
| 1:11:36| Honestly, you can't really stop somebody from yelling and screaming outside our public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4296)|
| 1:11:44| I can't hear you that well. Can you speak louder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| So as I was saying, I believe there will be other formulations of vaccine coming relatively quickly behind this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4308)|
| 1:11:58| So I don't want to spend too much money and time on storage of this vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| because hopefully we'll be able to transition to something that's a lot easier to store and a lot easier to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| and not focus just on this one because it's not going to be the only formulation that's available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4328)|
| 1:12:15| Okay. I just wanted to let you know, anything you need, we're going to be here to get you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair. A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| You're only going to get 975 at a time, or are we going to get two or three batches at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| What's the size of the batches that we will have here to give out to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| So again, we'll have to follow the guidance from the Tennessee Department of Health on who is prioritized to get this vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| and it will come out in small amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| So we can order 975 at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| We will start by ordering 975 and see how distribution goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| I'm just being really honest and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| I think distribution will go slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| I think we want to have it available, and I'm not going to limit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| but I also don't want to waste vaccine if there are other areas in the country where uptake is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| So I think we're in conversation right now, honestly, with medical providers and first responders who are skeptical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| and so we're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| So I think if anything we can do to increase vaccine uptake helps us move closer to getting rid of these things and some other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4398)|
| 1:13:26| I can barely see you all because I'm all fogged up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| But we will ensure that we get adequate supply based on our demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| but we've also learned from 13 years of in-school vaccination that vaccine uptake can vary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| and we don't want to waste valuable resources by having too much on hand and having to discard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4420)|
| 1:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| One more question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| On part of this statement and agreement here, this is approved as to legal form by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| It's not been signed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Will you be signing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4439)|

| 1:14:07| If you want me to sign it tonight, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| What I'm saying is it wasn't signed, and we go by the legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| So if it has been, we're not approving this particular document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| We're approving another document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| This body passes it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| There will be a signature on there approved by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| That's all I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| And then the mayor is the next one to sign off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Dr. Patan, I was just Googling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| That's 97 degrees below zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| That's very, very cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Is that unusual for a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| It's very unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| We generally store vaccine, and I'm going to look at Dina because I don't do this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| My director of nursing, Dina Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| We normally store it at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, which is much warmer than minus 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4491)|
| 1:14:59| So it's a real challenge with this vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Our staff will have to use, you know, appropriate safety equipment to remove it and use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| We do have some experience with dry ice and using when we had flu mist first came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| it was transported on dry ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| And we have some experience in managing and using dry ice if we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| I got through octa-plasma, or the plasma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| It's stored at minus 35 degrees or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| So that really was confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| The units you're saying, 975 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| So it's 975 doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| Is that so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| That is doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Yes, and it comes in a five-dose, five doses in a multi-dose vial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| That's too many doses in one sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| So it comes in a little vial that has five doses in it that will have to be thawed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| and then reconstituted, put together with liquid and administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| So we've got 975 total, not 975 times five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| No, not 975 times five, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Dr. Buchanan, is this the vaccine that is a two-dose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| Almost all of the vaccines will be two doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| There is one that I can't remember the name of that they're saying is going to be one dose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| So most of us in this room are too old to remember our first flu shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| but when you got your first flu shot, you had to have two doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| And we still do that with children under nine who haven't had a previous flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| They get two doses the first time they get a flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| It's to kind of get your immune system up and going and boost it to produce antibodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| and make you less likely to get COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| And what is the, on this particular vaccine, what is the timeframe between doses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| Most of them are 21 to 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| I don't have the timeframe on this one memorized, but unfortunately they won't be interchangeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| So if you get this Pfizer product, you will have to get your second dose with the Pfizer product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| We will have to also plan for that, and we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Okay, so if this were the only one, we will have to administer roughly 800,000, 900,000 doses within a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4627)|
| 1:17:17| if it takes two doses for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| How many other vaccines do you think will be coming out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Right now there are six more in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| And so the other thing, the other important thing is that we are not the only people giving this vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| Hospitals will get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Some doctors' offices will get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| So it will be administered by others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| We will not be the primary vaccinator in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| I see our role as filling those gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| You've got a small doctor's office, and they need their staff vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| We want to work with them to get their staff vaccinated, and also when it's available, their older patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| So with anywhere from three to five of these and different dosages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| how important is it going to be for communication among practitioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| You know, I go to my doctor, and he says, do you want a flu shot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| And then I go see another doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| He asks if I want a flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Well, it's all the same flu shot, I assume, where this is you could have had something here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| and then they try to give you something else somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| So part of that, and it's in here, I just can't remember exactly where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| Part of the agreement to participate is that you will use the state's immunization registry to document the vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4715)|
| 1:18:46| So anybody who's giving this vaccine can go look in the immunization registry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| and see that Martha Buchanan got a dose of, you know, XYZ COVID vaccine on this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| She's ready for her next dose, or she's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| So it won't matter if you go back to the same place, because anybody who's doing this is going to participate in the registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| We already participate in that registry on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| Most folks, their electronic health record can communicate with the registry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| so it's not an extra step for that doctor or their nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| You said that the first responders are going to be getting it first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| so will we be requiring them to have it and to basically make sure that they –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| one of the things that I've heard multiple times is we're worried that the hospital staff could get sick during COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| and numbers go down and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| So is that a possibility, or what direction do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| So it's all going to kind of come out at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| and it'll be controlled both at the state level and at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| So those hospital systems, like our large hospital systems here, I imagine –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| I know will participate, and they'll receive vaccine directly and vaccinate internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| what we call an internal pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| They'll vaccinate their staff themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| They will also, if they have enough, vaccinate hospital patients as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| First responders will work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| We've done this many, many times with flu vaccine with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| We receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| We go and have a closed pod with them for those who want to get vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| and vaccinate them on site when they're at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| We usually try to split a shift so they don't have to come in too many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| The reason I was asking is because the numbers that Commissioner Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| you know, they seem rather large, and I would hope for the hospital staff to get sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| and not be able to do some of the things that need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| They'll be getting it about the same time we're also administering it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| to other smaller groups of medical providers and first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| I'm full of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| Do we have a plan on how we're going to administer this to our school kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| School kids are actually kind of far down on the priority list that the state has developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| and that's based on the CDC guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| They are in tier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| I don't remember off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| So there are a couple different things about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| One is the vaccine that we have right now have primarily been tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4879)|

| 1:21:34| So these vaccines will be for adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4894)|

| 1:21:49| As we know, older adults, those with chronic medical conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| are more at risk for complications of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| So we're going to be targeting those folks, targeting those long-term care facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| targeting healthcare workers to reduce risk so they can stay in the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4921)|

| 1:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| I was just trying to think of a way with flu season coming on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| that we could vaccinate our kids at a better rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| And I don't know if it's a safe medical practice if the parent comes to get this vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| if they bring their kids and you give them the flu vaccine at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| We do that all the time, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=4945)|

| 1:25:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| This originated from two of our Knoxville delegation, Representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| Rick Staples and Senator Rick Briggs, and they instituted this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5146)|

| 1:26:01| Once the other legislators realized what a good thing this was, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| decided to have it statewide application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| So in May of this past year, the governor signed it into law as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| public chapter, and due to just COVID and Zoom meetings, this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| fell to the wayside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| So the Knoxville City Council has already gone through their first and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5188)|

| 1:26:42| And so this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| It was kind of basically I think the rest of the legislature said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| this is a great, you know, public health issue for all of Tennesseans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5210)|

| 1:29:32| Chris Caldwell, finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| Earlier this year we talked about the second court clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| using specific amount of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Were we told that those were going to be put in line item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| transfers whenever that happens because we haven't gotten an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| So I suspect there's not been any funds moved at all, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| We discussed it a little bit at the committee today, the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| It won't show up as a, you're talking about the circuit court clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| It won't show up as a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| It will show up basically as a payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| So to date we have given 76,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| I think that's the number I gave today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| I don't want to give two different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| 76,000 effective October the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| And so that's the total to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| So it's not as bad as we were anticipating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| And a lot of that is driven by the three pay periods in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| That's why it probably even got that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Director Caldwell, what was the total line of credit approved for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| Oh, we did 1.5, and we did 1.5 simply to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| we didn't want to go back to the comptroller more than one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| That was my whole goal was if we're going to go, let's go and ask for one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| And so we're not going to get close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| And we never thought we'd get close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| but you just never know what other elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| the offices could have had an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| And so that's why I just wanted to go once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5470)|

| 1:31:29| No, I think it's just cleaning stuff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5489)|

| 1:31:41| It's just probably clearing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| I know that we've not been able to do the pickups and a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5503)|

| 1:33:49| So can we all vote on that, the members that were part of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| just for the record and for clarity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| I'd need a little more detail on that to give you a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| What item are you referring to, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Item number 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| 62?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| That would be the piece of property located on Emory Road that was by Primose Land that at the very beginning was commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| and they were going to use Patriot Way to get to the back of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| We actually voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| It's to my understanding that there's some litigation on that, maybe them suing the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| I didn't know if we could vote on that as a body if we're being sued, just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| Is it the same property and it's under litigation right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| How about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| How about we have Director Book and Mr. Sanders look into it and give us some advice between now and next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| If you could, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| That's item 62, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Item number 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| We'll check on that and get this entire commission an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5698)|

| 1:35:05| I see Mr. Vernon Henry is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| Mr. Henry, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| I would love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| If you could, please take the podium and the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| And you have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Is it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5716)|

| 1:35:20| Vernon Henry, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| Are you able to hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Mr. Jay, first let's go to the transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| I want to let everybody know I'm not related to anybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| I'm not related to anybody on the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| This is one of the questions you should be asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| Who's speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| What ties they have to the health board and to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| Two, I'm going to paraphrase, I guess, a couple of commercials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| The first one, there was a TV show in the 70s called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| The 70s Show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Dad used to call his son all the time, Eric, a dumbass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| There's the Geico commercial where the blonde says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| let's get in the car, and the other guy says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| let's go hide behind the chainsaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| And the mass murderer is shaking his head going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| I don't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| The third one, it seems to be, this is an alien movie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| where we think we're going to get out of this alive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| and then the alien pops out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| In Hollywood, the good guys used to win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| and we always used to cheer the good guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| It seems to be lately the bad guys are winning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| and I just cannot figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| You guys are probably tired of hearing from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| Truth be spoken, I'm tired of being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| But at the end of the day, I feel a little bit like Eric's father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| about how I feel about what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| I've been listening to you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| I've been listening to Ms. Buchanan speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| And some of you make my skin crawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| You asked about 800,000 vials of vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| The reality, there's 470,000 people who live in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| excuse me, in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| The reality out here is that we keep seeming to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| pussyfooting around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| You guys want to talk about a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| I'm asking you not to take my word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| I listened to you guys last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| You went out and looked at properties and who was doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| We're giving you information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| We're giving you peer reviews, peer reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| We're giving you CDC numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| We're giving you information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| But if that information doesn't fit Buchanan's narrative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| it gets washed under the carpet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| Why are you guys not concerned at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| We are eight months into a two-week mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| You have a health director that you're paying $189,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| who doesn't have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| When you ask her for an answer, and we've asked for public form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| and somehow that managed to get blown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| We're still waiting for that public form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| Because the reality, we want answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| We deserve answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| Your responsibility is to help provide us with those answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| and you're not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| How much more has to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| The reality here is that the health board says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| oh, they're scared for their health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| Well, rightly so, they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| What family is going to lose their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| lose their health insurance, lose their phone, their car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| their house, their marriage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| What person are you going to push off the deep end who is going to react badly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| and somebody is going to pay the price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| Her standard answer is we're going to wear a mask until we get a vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| That's a hell of an answer for something that has a 99.97% success rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| cure rate, whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| You're going to get over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| You keep calling it a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Go to the CDC website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| It's a look, but you can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| How many people have died from COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| About 12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5950)|

| 1:39:19| The last five days, we haven't heard a damn thing about COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5959)|

| 1:39:35| Strange how that just miraculously appeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| We talked about responsibility and authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| You've given them the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| The responsibility is yours, and you don't want to take it away from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5984)|

| 1:39:56| She gets the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Watch out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| You'll have a mandated vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| And if that happens, good people will die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| Their own numbers say about 700,000 people will probably have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201109?start=6008)|
