| 0:00:35| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=35)|
| 0:00:36| I have some announcements from the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| This is the last 6 o'clock meeting of the Veer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| Beginning on July the 19th, Veer Board will meet at 5 and Council will be meeting at 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=40)|
| 0:00:46| and that's an hour earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=46)|
| 0:00:48| We think it will be to everyone's advantage to be starting an hour earlier than waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| Now, back to the normal announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=55)|
| 0:00:58| When I call the name of the business applying for the permit, come to the podium, state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=58)|
| 0:01:03| your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=63)|

| 0:01:21| can pick up your Veer permit from the business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| And Veer Board members, we're still saving trees, and I suspect we'll have several applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| that will be deferred, so pass your package around to get it to Ms. Day if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=92)|

| 0:04:05| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| We're missing the test class and fingerprints and background check for both the owner and the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| Okay. Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| We need the building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Since Councilman Kampen just came in, could I have someone else make a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| I defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| So that would be deferring it to July the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=275)|

| 0:04:38| Okay. Councilman De La Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Ms. Dyer, would you explain to them why we're deferring it just so they don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Before we can issue you a permit, you have to take the test class down at KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| and you have to submit to a background check through TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| And we cannot approve a permit until the background and records check has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| So once that is done and then you get the other things done, then you'll be able to pick up your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| And you will need to come back here next month on July the 19th at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=313)|

| 0:05:38| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| We need a copy of your LLC and the health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| I already emailed it to Wanderday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| I've got a copy over here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Councilman De La Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Move to approve pending the final documentation being received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=354)|

| 0:05:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| No, I left that light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=360)|

| 0:09:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=598)|

| 0:10:03| meetings an hour earlier so that they will start at 6 rather than 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| And of necessity, that means that the beer board has to come a little bit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| And some people may not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=612)|

| 0:11:08| Then we'll hope that they have those done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=668)|

| 0:11:17| And I know that Mr. Love is very eager for Lonesome Dove to get that final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| He thought it would be done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=682)|

| 0:12:28| It just went right out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Two remedial plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| The second one, Mr. Burleson can demonstrate for us if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| And it is a way of checking the IDs so that it's less likely that this will ever happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| Unfortunately, TABC is in somewhat of a busy mode right now because of the wine permit issues and changes in leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=762)|
| 0:12:51| So they have not yet received their hearing date and information from TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| So I'm going to ask that we defer this until we get the TABC notice and then we'll handle it all at one time, if that would please the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=778)|
| 0:13:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Mr. Harrison, you're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Would you like to say anything on behalf of Mr. Burleson or step aside and let him speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| Well, I think Mr. Burleson is part of the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| There's a new thing, new to me anyway, that he has done and purchased for all his employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| And maybe you all have heard of it before, but I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| It's an app on your phone that the employees can utilize when checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| And it'll they don't have to no longer they don't have to calculate the days to see if someone is of age to purchase alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=822)|
| 0:13:51| They now just can scan the ID with the app on the phone and it'll come back a color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| And I'll let Mr. Burleson further explain, but that was kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Actually scan the actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| With your phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| You know, everybody's got cell phones now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| If you have children like I do or young adults, they don't ever leave without those cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| There's been a lot of recent additions to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| So they can utilize their cell phone in scanning the ID presented and no longer do they have to calculate the days to see if someone's of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=857)|
| 0:14:27| It'll just come back a particular color, let's say green if it's OK, red if it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| And I'm worried about our math programs, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| That's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| So Mr. Burleson has that here if you want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| But I thought that was kind of unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| And we did include that in our remedial plan the first time I'd heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| And you have a good remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| We always some of them are so sketchy that you're not sure that they thought anything through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| But yours was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Does this also determine if it's a counterfeit ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Our unique situation this time is that the server went to the table, carded the table of underage individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=902)|
| 0:15:09| went back to proceed to ring it in, was sent back out by a fellow server saying those guys are way too young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| He went back to the table a second time and carded them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| I mean, when we run 11 restaurants in Knox County and only have one server who cannot get it right after two visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| it's very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| And Bistro is not a place that normally is frequented by underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| It's more of an older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| It is a mature audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| We're all familiar with Bistro, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| Well, does anybody have any questions for Mr. Burleson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| He was going to show us the magic app here or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Now, while he's getting ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| Let's see if he can get this youngster to pull his driver's license out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Does it work with a flip phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| All the kids have iPhones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Get your license out, Sonny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Mr. Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| He'll have root beer if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| It's the back of your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Just the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Oh, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| It's a scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| You just hit that button right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| It comes back in and you just see that and it tells me Marshall Stare, 37, male, valid ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Okay, check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Do I get a beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| If you pay for it, you can go to his place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| By state law, I'm not allowed to buy you alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| I'll buy you a hamburger, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| That's all your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| That's wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| And you set it to be 21 and under for it to turn up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| I didn't know you were 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| I don't show my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| It's frustrating when we all know the state IDs have a box that say under 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| and the server goes twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| It's actually marked on the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| On an underage ID, it's marked red and it says under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| And it's very frustrating when they can't, for some reason, they don't want to do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| If they're colorblind and don't see red, they think it's green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Yeah, they'll be colorblind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| So far we have an order for one beer and one walker down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| I want his chicken fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| He wants the chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Let's go back to the heel of the agenda to the people who have not appeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| Big B tobacco and beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| We're done with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| American Cancer Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| We'll look forward to seeing you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| July 19th at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Well, there's no guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Oh, so we don't have a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| No, you don't have a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| If ABC contacts you, then we'll be in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Let's get back to the American Cancer Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| They didn't take the pass class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Mr. Frost, do you want to talk about the issue with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Well, their event is going to be at the Mill and Mine, which it's my understanding the Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| and Mine has its own beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| And you can't have two beer permits for one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| They might not even need to be applying for a beer permit and can use what's there at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| the Mill and Mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| But, you know, they applied anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| I called Iris this afternoon and left a message and have not heard back from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| And I did ask her to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| And I would hope I'll keep trying until I finally track her down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| So we're going to defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Do we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Can we vote to defer that to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Next, we're going to El Zocalo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| El Zocalo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| I forgot Casanova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Casanova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Aya Ayesh, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Mohammed Ayesh, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| They've also not taken it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| And they've not taken the things either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| This is in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Well, I'm going to make a motion that we move it to the next meeting, postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| Also, talk with Chief Roush today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160621?start=1161)|
