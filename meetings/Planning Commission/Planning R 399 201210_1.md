| 3:15:40| to a lack of use on review approval. Frankly, it's nonsense. Following Mr. Whittall's argument to his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11740)|
| 3:15:47| logical – all right, let me jump to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| I'm sorry. I'm going to have to cut you off. We're running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11749)|
| 3:15:53| There are individuals that would like to speak in opposition to this answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11753)|
| 3:15:59| Staff will – well, Chair will recognize Mr. Wayne Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11764)|
| 3:16:08| Thank you. My name is Wayne Kline. I represent the Westland West Homeowners Association. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11768)|
| 3:16:14| includes Mr. Whittall. My address is 617 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11774)|
| 3:16:21| In 2013, MPC staff reviewed the Huber property proposal for a PR density of 1 to 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11781)|
| 3:16:30| to be located on property lying on both sides of Emory Church Road, both sides of I-140 and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11790)|
| 3:16:36| both sides of Fort Lauderdale Lake. At that density, MPC calculated that 333 units could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11796)|
| 3:16:44| be constructed on the entire property. 240 units were constructed on the east side of Emory Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11804)|
| 3:16:50| Road. As a part of the use on review, MPC approved 72 units on the hill on the west side of Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11810)|
| 3:16:58| Church Road, east of I-140. Now, in 2016, Mr. Huber sold two tracts from this PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11818)|
| 3:17:07| One was a 6.205-acre tract at 944 Emory Church Road, which was located north of the Fort Lauderdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11827)|
| 3:17:15| Lake and east of Emory Church Road. The other one, 1.31-acre tract at tax map 144, 20.18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11835)|
| 3:17:25| and tax map 144, 20.19, was located west of the I-140 and north of Fort Lauderdale Lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11845)|
| 3:17:34| and south of Emory Church Road. The October 21, 2016, warranty date, which we've provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11854)|
| 3:17:43| in the record from Huber Clearwater Properties to Mr. and Mrs. Hancock makes no mention of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11863)|
| 3:17:51| retention of development rights. The November 4, 2016, warranty deed, which is also in the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11871)|
| 3:17:59| from Huber Clearwater Properties LLC to Frank and Belinda Gambusa also makes no mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11879)|
| 3:18:06| of retention of development rights. In support of this use on review request for 96 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11886)|
| 3:18:14| on the west side of Emory Church Road, Mr. Huber and now Mr. Silva are asserting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11894)|
| 3:18:20| not only do they have retained development rights associated with the 2016 sales, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11900)|
| 3:18:28| that they can assign a density of one unit or more to this tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11908)|
| 3:18:34| Under Tennessee property law, Mr. Huber has no legal right to do either. Mr. Huber does not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11914)|
| 3:18:41| the right to use the land he sold to determine how many units he may build on the remaining part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11921)|
| 3:18:48| of the PR zone. Approval of the requested 96 units in this use on review request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11928)|
| 3:18:55| would increase the density above the PR 1 to 5 density and violate the Knox County Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11935)|
| 3:19:02| and the general plan, which limit PR density to a maximum at this site of 1 to 5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11942)|
| 3:19:09| Now, there is a Tennessee statute that talks about transfer rights. It's TCA Section 13-7-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11949)|
| 3:19:20| but you have to have it in the ordinance and it has to be appropriately reflected on the deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11960)|
| 3:19:27| We don't have it in our ordinance, folks, and so we can't use it and neither can Mr. Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11967)|
| 3:19:33| or Clearwater Properties use it to transfer development rights. So, to put it simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11973)|
| 3:19:40| you can't transfer density when you sell a parcel of property. There's nothing in our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11980)|
| 3:19:46| ordinance that allows such a transfer, nor is there any statute, ordinance, or planning regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11986)|
| 3:19:53| that allows such a transfer. And you can't buy density from another property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11993)|
| 3:20:00| So, we respectfully request this body not allow an increase of density beyond the PR 1 to 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12000)|
| 3:20:08| on this use on review. And thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12008)|
| 3:20:13| Thank you. Any other opposition would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12013)|
| 3:20:21| Hearing none, I will chair recognize Commissioner Sproth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12021)|
| 3:20:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I indicated earlier, I've been contacted by several people and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12033)|
| 3:20:42| and I think there's enough question about the density and that kind of thing that needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12042)|
| 3:20:47| be worked out before we vote to approve or disapprove this application. So, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12047)|
| 3:20:52| make a motion we postpone this for 60 days. Second, Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12052)|
| 3:20:59| All right. We have a motion by Commissioner Ross, seconded by Commissioner Buston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12059)|
| 3:21:04| to postpone for 60 days. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12064)|
| 3:21:11| I just wanted to ask a question. When the density was assigned originally to five units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12071)|
| 3:21:16| an acre, were all of these properties in one track or were they in separate tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12076)|
| 3:21:25| They were all, technically it was two tracks. This is John Huber again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12085)|
| 3:21:31| Okay. Yeah. I mean, it'd be my understanding of the way I've always seen things done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12091)|
| 3:21:38| if a track is zoned, you have a certain amount of density that's connected to that track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12098)|
| 3:21:45| And when you start chopping it up, you know, you can move, you can allocate that density any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12105)|
| 3:21:51| you want within that track. So, now if these were two, you know, the Hancock track was a separate one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12111)|
| 3:21:59| from the track that you're trying to do apartments on now, then I don't know that you could shift the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12119)|
| 3:22:05| density there. But I don't know if that was the case. No, it was all, it was all under the Melgard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12125)|
| 3:22:11| name. It just happened to be in two separate ones. It's over 101 acres total. And part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12131)|
| 3:22:19| the use on review was that if you look at, I think, requirement number 18 in the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12139)|
| 3:22:26| use on review from 2013, MPC required that we have a survey completed on all of the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12146)|
| 3:22:34| And while doing that, we allocated, or not allocated, but came up with a number of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12154)|
| 3:22:43| if you will, dry, anything above the 820 contour, the high waterline for the Tennessee River and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12163)|
| 3:22:49| Sinking Creek. What was the acreage above that? And that's what they were going to base the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12169)|
| 3:22:55| of units on, multiply it by five. So, early on, I think the staff had some inaccurate mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12175)|
| 3:23:02| information. And ultimately, I think they said we had 66 some odd acres is what they estimated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12182)|
| 3:23:08| times five. That's where they came up with the 333, where the 333 number came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12188)|
| 3:23:15| But once the survey got done, it was determined that there are 72.4 acres there above the 820| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12195)|
| 3:23:23| that was available to be used for the density. So, the 72.4 times five gets us to the 362| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12203)|
| 3:23:31| available units to be used in different locations on that property. Now, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12211)|
| 3:23:37| just like everybody said, it's a challenging piece. It's bifurcated by Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12217)|
| 3:23:43| Emory Church Road, Sinking Creek Embayment. So, even though it was effectively one large track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12223)|
| 3:23:49| there was a lot of other things there. So, within that use on review in 2013, we assigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12229)|
| 3:23:58| just like you would any other subdivision, we did the Westland Cove subdivision. It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12238)|
| 3:24:03| matter if there was roads around it or not. We did a Westland Cove subdivision and assigned two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| units of density to what we call the Gamboozah property next to Mr. Gamboozah's house at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12247)|
| 3:24:13| and one unit of density to what we call the Hancock piece over there. And we took the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12253)|
| 3:24:22| of the density and built, put it towards the apartments. And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12262)|
| 3:24:26| Commissioner Hoover, I have to interject here. We can't continue this discussion all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12266)|
| 3:24:33| We've got two other commissioners that would like to speak. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| I'm going to recognize Commissioner Korbelick. Thank you. I have a series of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12275)|
| 3:24:42| but I'll keep it quick. The first one I have is to staff. I've got four different densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12282)|
| 3:24:50| in listening and reading. I've got 60 acres, which would be 333 densities, which is what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12290)|
| 3:24:58| applicant stated. I've got 66.67 acres, which would equal 348 units, which is what the 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12298)|
| 3:25:10| concept report indicates. And now we're stating there's 72 units, which would be 362,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12310)|
| 3:25:19| 72 acres, which would be 362 units. If indeed this application is postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12319)|
| 3:25:27| I would sure like to know which is the right number. And I just, I call that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12327)|
| 3:25:35| I would also like to... This is exactly why I made the motion to postpone, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12335)|
| 3:25:41| Yeah. Let me just clarify what I'd be looking for. And then I would like to actually see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12341)|
| 3:25:47| the concept plan to determine if the densities are geographically depicted on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12347)|
| 3:25:54| And I have a quick question for Mr. Wise, which he can answer, again, if it's postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12354)|
| 3:26:00| which is his opinion regarding the density transfer discussion that the applicant has presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12360)|
| 3:26:07| And then my final question, I'm working right along here, is to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12367)|
| 3:26:12| which is what do you think about a 60-day postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12372)|
| 3:26:18| If I may respond, this is John King. I tried to get the attention of the chair. It's rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12378)|
| 3:26:26| difficult. We all understand it's a little bit awkward to try and operate in this fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12386)|
| 3:26:32| but I'm sorry. I missed that chance. But, you know, Commissioner, I never like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12392)|
| 3:26:42| oppose a request for postponement made by a commission member. I understand and respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12402)|
| 3:26:53| your position. And believe me, I comprehend sometimes the interest in having such a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12413)|
| 3:27:06| I hope you understand that developers and people seeking zoning rulings of one sort or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12426)|
| 3:27:17| frequently don't like postponements. I expressed at the start my preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12437)|
| 3:27:26| that there not be a postponement. But I can tell you that I also have difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12446)|
| 3:27:33| just bowing up over when it's the request of a commission member. I listened to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12453)|
| 3:27:42| Kerberlich's questions, and frankly, I could probably answer most of them today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12462)|
| 3:27:48| but I will try to do that in another fashion. Our preference is that we go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12468)|
| 3:28:01| but I understand that there are instances where commission members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12481)|
| 3:28:07| can justify their request for a postponement. Thank you, Mr. King. Thank you. You had a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12487)|
| 3:28:16| for Attorney Wise, Ms. Kerberlich. Yes, but we can't address that at the postponement unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12496)|
| 3:28:24| he knows the answer right off the bat. Well, the commission is acting in a judicial role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12504)|
| 3:28:36| and when it's considering this application. And so you're going to be making an adjudication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12516)|
| 3:28:42| based on all the evidence presented. The applicant's taking the position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12522)|
| 3:28:50| this proposal, this development plan is part, is a constituent part of the overall development of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12530)|
| 3:28:56| total of what was 101 acres. Opposition is taking the position that the property that has been sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12536)|
| 3:29:03| off can no longer be considered as a portion of that. I will tell you that the outsale or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12543)|
| 3:29:12| long-term leasing of particularly commercial property that's subject to the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12552)|
| 3:29:18| plan is quite common, and the sales are subject to the provisions of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12558)|
| 3:29:25| In this instance, the applicant did not bring back the entire 101 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12565)|
| 3:29:31| just brought back the, I believe it's correct, just brought back that portion that they still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12571)|

| 3:29:46| original approval and the original density. And they've given you some documents to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12586)|
| 3:29:52| argument, the letter from Mr. Hancock, and then of course the idea that when Mr. Gambuzzi wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12592)|
| 3:30:00| develop his property, he had to get permission, which would indicate, I think, evidence that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12600)|
| 3:30:07| that person at least understood that the development plan did control that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12607)|
| 3:30:12| But whether that's sufficient to compel you to judge that this is a constituent part of a greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12612)|
| 3:30:19| development, or as Mr. Klein has argued, that no, those properties are gone, that's a judgment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12619)|
| 3:30:25| you'll have to make based upon the entirety of the record once it's put before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12625)|
| 3:30:30| Thank you, Mr. Wise. Chair recognizes Commissioner Uden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12630)|
| 3:30:35| Yeah, I'm with Jeff. I need a little more information here. I don't see why we need 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12635)|
| 3:30:44| days. I would think that between now and next month, the applicant can provide a few answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12644)|
| 3:30:52| that Commissioner Korbelik brought up, which I think ought to get us there. I would, instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12652)|
| 3:31:00| us shutting this thing off at five minutes, I'd like to have this on our agenda review meeting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12660)|
| 3:31:05| Tuesday. And if the applicant needs to come up with exhibits and have the county there with us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12665)|
| 3:31:10| verify that the 820 is what it is and agree on what this acreage is or not, that's what I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12670)|
| 3:31:20| to know. And if we truly are adding, for example, one more story onto a building that was already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12680)|
| 3:31:28| contemplated on a site plan and the acreage would support the density and really all we're doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12688)|
| 3:31:33| extend the parking lot a few more feet to add some other parking spaces, then I, you know, and he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12693)|
| 3:31:38| made, he's already made these offsite improvements, you know, I'm willing to listen to it. I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12698)|
| 3:31:44| why we need 60 days to figure all that out. I would think that a 30-day postponement would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12704)|
| 3:31:50| more in order. Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12710)|
| 3:31:57| And I agree to a degree with Commissioner Ood. However, I would add this, just listening to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12717)|
| 3:32:03| this, I'm not for sure who's on first and who's on second at this point, just because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12723)|
| 3:32:08| complexity of it. And I think looking at the 60 days, as Commissioner Roth has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12728)|
| 3:32:13| gives us a better chance where we might be in person, where we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12733)|
| 3:32:17| with this might be sped up a little bit, where we can get some answers and have a better back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12737)|
| 3:32:21| and forth on this complicated one. So I would support Commissioner Roth, just knowing, looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12741)|
| 3:32:26| at the timeline of when we meet again, we may still be in virtual. And I don't know that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12746)|
| 3:32:31| one is real conducive to that. I'd rather be in person when we're doing this one. So I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12751)|
| 3:32:37| support Commissioner Roth, 60-day postponement. Commissioner Smith, you're very optimistic that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12757)|
| 3:32:43| we're going to be meeting in 60 days or 90 days. I wish I was. I'm going to live in the optimistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12763)|

| 3:32:59| Thank you. I support Commissioner Roth's 60 days as well, because I think it's important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12779)|
| 3:33:04| remember that many people are celebrating holidays throughout this, the month between now and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12784)|
| 3:33:10| next meeting. So that's going to limit everyone's ability to be able to get answers, meet, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12790)|
| 3:33:16| So I think 60 days is really wise for this one. All right. Thank you, Commissioner. We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12796)|
| 3:33:22| Let's vote. I'm ready to vote. We have a motion by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=12802)|

| 3:41:36| Okay. Just to recap, Kim Frazier here, 11835 Couch Mill Road. I'm the founder and director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13296)|
| 3:41:42| of Hardin Valley Planning Advocates and also the community outreach coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13302)|
| 3:41:46| for the Knox County Planning Alliance. First of all, season's greetings to everyone, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13306)|
| 3:41:52| It's been a long year, so happy holidays. Thank you, Chairman Phillips, and thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13312)|
| 3:41:56| commissioners. Thank you for your service and also this opportunity just to provide you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13316)|
| 3:42:01| with some perspective that I hope that you'll consider in regards to the proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13321)|
| 3:42:06| to the commission's bylaws pertaining to the Order of Speakers. As some of you know, and I know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13326)|
| 3:42:12| have some new faces on commission, I've spent the last four years as a citizen advocate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13332)|
| 3:42:17| intentional growth with coordinated infrastructure. This volunteer work has provided me with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13337)|
| 3:42:22| opportunity to engage with citizens all across our county and share with them the ins and outs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13342)|
| 3:42:28| the land use process, how they as citizens can best prepare their message to you and provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13348)|
| 3:42:34| them with any resources that they might need. This has also afforded me the opportunity to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13354)|
| 3:42:39| various concerns held by citizens, not only about land use and development, but their concerns and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13359)|
| 3:42:44| perspectives about the process itself. As I am sure that you're aware, land use is a very emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13364)|
| 3:42:51| topic and when I am sitting with these citizens and explaining to them the steps required for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13371)|
| 3:42:57| rezoning, a sector plan, use on review, public forum, you can see and feel the angst, the frustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13377)|
| 3:43:05| the complete overwhelm that they experience with this process, especially when I tell them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13385)|
| 3:43:11| they have approximately 10 days to prepare and about five minutes to state their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13391)|
| 3:43:17| The question that I most frequently hear are, or questions I should say, the first one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13397)|
| 3:43:24| so the applicant has months and groups of professionals to assist them to prepare their case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13404)|
| 3:43:29| and we have less than two weeks and five minutes that we have to divide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13409)|
| 3:43:32| among various speakers. The second question that I hear a lot is, why can't the notifications to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13412)|
| 3:43:38| citizens include a larger area to reach more citizens and why can't it be sooner? And lastly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13418)|
| 3:43:45| I repeatedly hear from citizens is the question, why does the applicant get to choose to defer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13425)|
| 3:43:51| the opposition when the burden to prove that their project is the highest and best use of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13431)|
| 3:43:57| should fall on them? As you know, I too have asked these questions and many, many more and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13437)|
| 3:44:03| that's why I wanted to share with you today just the firsthand accounts of how the current order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13443)|
| 3:44:08| of speakers impacts our citizens and your discussion because I'm out there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13448)|
| 3:44:15| I'm all over Knox County. I'm sitting in living rooms, walking properties, watching their faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13455)|
| 3:44:22| as I go over step-by-step how this process works, how they can review case files and ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13462)|
| 3:44:29| how they can prepare and what they can expect. In addition, I wanted to kind of share a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13469)|
| 3:44:36| bit of my professional background as a personnel management and consultant because policies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13476)|
| 3:44:42| procedures are kind of my jam, if you will. I'm a rule follower. I like order, I like consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13482)|
| 3:44:48| So many of my conversations that I have with planning and county staff or even county officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13488)|
| 3:44:54| are about policy and process and how small and sometimes big improvements can yield very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13494)|
| 3:45:00| positive outcomes. And one of those process improvements that I've brought to many folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13500)|
| 3:45:05| attention is the order of speakers as written in various bylaws and how they should be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13505)|
| 3:45:10| throughout all of Knox County's public hearing processes. So just a few months ago, we were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13510)|
| 3:45:16| to have a very productive discussion with County Commission and point out that their bylaws do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13516)|
| 3:45:20| in fact, state that the applicant should present first. So amending your bylaws to require the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13520)|
| 3:45:25| applicant to present first would align with existing bylaws for other county decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13525)|
| 3:45:30| bodies. It would also align with similar municipalities such as Nashville, and I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13530)|
| 3:45:35| send that to you all to take a look. Another important process consideration is balance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13535)|
| 3:45:40| equity. Amending this bylaw would balance the responsibility of the applicant to provide this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13540)|
| 3:45:45| body a case for support of a proposed land use. When talking with citizens, I always encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13545)|
| 3:45:50| them to reach out to the applicant and discuss a land use proposal prior to coming before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13550)|
| 3:45:55| But as you know, all parties are not always agreeable. So when a case comes before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13555)|
| 3:46:00| it is often the first time that the citizens have heard from the applicant and been privy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13560)|
| 3:46:06| the proposed use of land. So by requiring the applicant to present first, you will be providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13566)|
| 3:46:11| a more equitable foundation for discussion for all parties, including this body, and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13571)|
| 3:46:17| eliminate the unnecessary stigma that does exist that the process is weighted on the side of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13577)|
| 3:46:22| applicant. So to close, I want to leave you with a simple word picture because I love word pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13582)|
| 3:46:27| So just imagine that this is a classroom setting and you are the teacher. You are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13587)|
| 3:46:33| the students or citizens to come in and take a test without providing any study material and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13593)|
| 3:46:38| only five minutes to prepare. So that's how the citizens feel. The applicant should carry the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13598)|
| 3:46:44| weight of making a case as to why a proposed land use is or is not within Knox County's permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13604)|
| 3:46:50| zonings and uses. Thanks so much for your time and I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13610)|
| 3:46:57| Thank you, Ms. Frazier. Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13617)|
| 3:47:07| Thanks. I guess what I wanted to bring up is just in the way that the speaker works or has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13627)|
| 3:47:14| in the past, I feel like it's just it's going to take a lot longer if the applicant has to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13634)|
| 3:47:22| their presentation first and then hear the opposition and then hope to get time to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13642)|
| 3:47:30| By the time we get to the meeting, I mean, the proposal of the applicant is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13650)|
| 3:47:35| We have pages of documentation about what the zoning request is or what the concept plan entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13655)|
| 3:47:41| Obviously, I mean, the presentation is out there. We mail notices to residents in the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13661)|
| 3:47:49| area. So I think that what I want to, what I don't want to miss out on is the efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13669)|
| 3:47:56| use of time. And we all know that these meetings, even anticipated short meetings, go long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13676)|
| 3:48:02| If the applicant lets the opposition go first, then he gets to hear their concerns and then he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13682)|
| 3:48:09| can use the balance or she can use the balance of that time to answer those questions. I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13689)|
| 3:48:16| it's a very, very simple thing. And I just can't think of any reasons that hold water to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13696)|
| 3:48:23| to do the other way. But that's just my opinion. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13703)|
| 3:48:30| say that, you know, being on the Planning Commission, this is not necessarily my first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13710)|
| 3:48:35| rotary. I've attended probably well over a thousand planning commissions in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13715)|
| 3:48:40| This is the first one I've ever dealt with where the applicant is given the prerogative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13720)|
| 3:48:46| even going first or second. And in every other case, in every other community I've been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13726)|
| 3:48:51| in, the applicant always goes first, followed by residents or opposition. And then if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13731)|
| 3:48:58| are questions afterward for the developer or the applicant, the commission can redirect those to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13738)|
| 3:49:03| the applicant. I think it actually will save time, ultimately, because it is gets confusing. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13743)|
| 3:49:11| that's my opinion. So for what it's worth, that's my two cents. Chair will recognize Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13751)|
| 3:49:17| Graf. Thank you. I didn't take my hand down, but Scott Smith said everything that I had on my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13757)|
| 3:49:29| that I think that we are the application is the applicant's proposal, and all the information is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13769)|
| 3:49:40| in there. And there wouldn't be anybody objecting to it if they hadn't read it. If they didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13780)|
| 3:49:49| what was going on, or they didn't care, they wouldn't be there to talk about it. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13789)|
| 3:49:56| the way it's being handled right now, the applicant does go first, but like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13796)|
| 3:50:03| generally, they defer to the opposition. I'm 100% in agreement with that. I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13803)|
| 3:50:12| where if we change it, it's going to make any difference for the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13812)|
| 3:50:20| Just we're going to change it to change it is the only thing I can see. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13820)|
| 3:50:25| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13825)|
| 3:50:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I just want to say, you know, I was planning on supporting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13829)|
| 3:50:34| till we had the presenter. And when you say that we're going to become, you know, more like Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13834)|
| 3:50:40| in aligning ourselves, considering the dumpster fire that Davidson County has been the last few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13840)|
| 3:50:45| years, I don't know that that would be the best thing for Knoxville. And then after hearing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13845)|
| 3:50:49| my fellow commissioners, I will not be in support of this now. So thought it was going to be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13849)|
| 3:50:54| And then, you know, after hearing the discussion, I've changed my mind. So I would just recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13854)|
| 3:51:02| you know, maybe look at what would be best for Knoxville, and not necessarily what other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13862)|
| 3:51:09| are doing that may not be doing it so well. Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13869)|
| 3:51:14| Commissioner Dent. Thank you. I was, you know, paying attention to this meeting today. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13874)|
| 3:51:23| actually, the large majority of the cases followed what we're discussing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13883)|
| 3:51:29| where the applicant went first and explained before opposition. And it's, you know, 535.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13889)|
| 3:51:36| And I don't know that we gained or lost time. So I don't see why it would be a problem to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13896)|
| 3:51:43| ahead and do it that way. You know, the applicant stated their case, opposition talked, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13903)|
| 3:51:48| they had a chance to rebut it. So I think trying to at least appear as if we're, you know, giving a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13908)|
| 3:51:56| fair shot to everyone just looks better optically. And then this isn't really on topic. But I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13916)|
| 3:52:04| the idea that we give one person, so to speak, five minutes, and then up to 20 people have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13924)|
| 3:52:11| share five minutes, unless we grant more, in one, it doesn't look good. And two, it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13931)|
| 3:52:17| it just quite literally isn't fair. So I know that that's an entirely separate topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13937)|
| 3:52:22| which will require a different bylaw change. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13942)|
| 3:52:26| I think that's just very telling to how people view, you know, how we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13946)|
| 3:52:32| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13952)|
| 3:52:35| Yes, I would like to echo Commissioner Dent's comments. And I would like to add that it gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13955)|
| 3:52:48| the applicant actually a chance to clarify any confusion that might occur, or to indicate anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13968)|
| 3:52:57| that would be to that applicant's benefit, like, oh, we just had a neighborhood meeting. Or yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13977)|
| 3:53:03| I've made this, I'm willing to make these changes. We need to make sure that we not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13983)|
| 3:53:12| are transparent and fair, but that we appear transparent. And fair, we have an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13992)|
| 3:53:18| burden as a decision making or and recommending body and arm of the government. And I strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=13998)|
| 3:53:27| endorse the staff's proposal to amend the bylaws as shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14007)|
| 3:53:33| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14013)|
| 3:53:37| Yes, I'd just like to concur with Commissioner Korbelik and Commissioner Dent. And for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14017)|
| 3:53:44| reasons that they stated, but also for bringing the commission into alignment with what the rest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14024)|
| 3:53:53| the governmental bodies are doing. And just to make a note about the difference in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14033)|
| 3:54:02| while all of the documents are online, people can look at them, the case can be reviewed. Most people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14042)|
| 3:54:08| who are opposing or are stepping into this particular venue are doing so for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14048)|
| 3:54:16| And it takes a while to bone up and figure out what does all of this even mean. So to present a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14056)|
| 3:54:22| fair case, I think that also needs to be considered. And anything that they can do, just in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14062)|
| 3:54:27| knowing, I will be speaking second, this is how this process will work, will bring a consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14067)|
| 3:54:32| that will help them in that process. Thank you. Commissioner Oden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14072)|
| 3:54:40| I really could go either way with this. I just want to give a little bit of history. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14080)|
| 3:54:44| obviously, I've worked for Planning Commission staff back in, good grief, 1991, 1992. So I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14084)|
| 3:54:54| been around this for quite a while. And it's been working that way as long as I can remember. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14094)|
| 3:55:02| the nice flow that I thought we had when we had public meetings, now it may be different on Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14102)|
| 3:55:09| and I can see where everybody would want a change like this on Zoom, it would make more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14109)|
| 3:55:15| But when you have a normal flow of a meeting, you know, and I'll go back to Arthur Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14115)|
| 3:55:22| was a good person that did this in a normal course. The applicant pays their fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14122)|
| 3:55:28| they submit their plans, they get a ton of back and forth with staff. Staff writes a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14128)|
| 3:55:33| very thorough recommendation. I think we lose sight sometimes when we get on these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14133)|
| 3:55:39| and we start asking questions that, you know, our professional staff has gone through ad nauseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14139)|
| 3:55:46| and come to a professional recommendation of what they think we ought to do one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14146)|
| 3:55:52| When the applicant gets down to the meeting, we advise them at the first of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14152)|
| 3:55:58| at least we used to, we read this at the first of the meeting, you know, somebody needs to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14158)|
| 3:56:04| somebody needs to represent the group. And if there are multiple speakers, you're not to repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14164)|
| 3:56:11| if you can help it, what these other speakers said. You know, if you want to speak, come with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14171)|
| 3:56:15| something different than some other person in opposition said. So I do think there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14175)|
| 3:56:22| merit of the applicant going last. That way, the staff reads the recommendation, they go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14182)|
| 3:56:29| it, hit the high points. The opposition gives their three or four different reasons for different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14189)|
| 3:56:37| people why they don't like what's being presented. Arthur used to always write down individually what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14197)|
| 3:56:43| these people said, then he would go up to the podium with, okay, number one, traffic. Here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14203)|
| 3:56:48| our traffic engineer. Number two was drainage. Here's our engineer for drainage. This is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14208)|
| 3:56:53| he can speak to. And I do think there was some sort of flow that worked a little bit better going that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14213)|
| 3:56:59| way. You know, what I will say is, you know, Ms. Fraser and her group have done, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14219)|
| 3:57:07| a great job over the last three or four years getting everybody to open those lines of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14227)|
| 3:57:12| and push that. And I think that has been for the good. So I don't think that this is anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14232)|
| 3:57:21| indifference to what somebody would want to do or what county commission is doing. I just happen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14241)|
| 3:57:25| think the applicants paid the money. They've been reviewed by staff. Everybody's reading the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14245)|
| 3:57:31| recommendation. And I think the council and the applicant ought to be able to sit back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14251)|
| 3:57:38| listen to those things that are wrong and be able to come up and respond to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14258)|
| 3:57:42| But I'll go either way. Not hurt either way. Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Ason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14262)|
| 3:57:50| I think that the applicant can also read the opposition's comments. And if they present first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14270)|
| 3:57:57| they have the opportunity to up front address either the opposition that they have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14277)|
| 3:58:04| before. The opposition has a chance to speak. I think it's nice for it'll be nice for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14284)|
| 3:58:10| have that consistency. And so based on that, I would like to make a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14290)|
| 3:58:18| the amendment to the bylaws per staff recommendation. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14298)|
| 3:58:24| I'll second that. Corbaill. All right. Thank you. Before we go to the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14304)|
| 3:58:28| I want to recognize Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14308)|
| 3:58:40| Commissioner Buston, is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14320)|
| 3:58:45| Yeah, listening to all the comments, when this was first recommended, I was in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14325)|
| 3:58:53| But listening to some of the comments about things not being fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14333)|
| 3:58:59| I've sat on this board for quite a few years. And one thing that we advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14339)|
| 3:59:06| is more time for community when there are a lot of community members to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14346)|
| 3:59:13| So I feel like that's not a fair comment. Because I think that we, as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14353)|
| 3:59:21| try very, very hard. I think we almost make an exception to the community to make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14361)|
| 3:59:31| are listening and working in a fair way. I understand that. I believe like Chris said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14371)|
| 3:59:40| Commissioner Newton said, our staff works really hard. And if you read all of their recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14380)|
| 3:59:48| I know it's a lot of work, but I try to. It's pretty much laid out for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14388)|
| 3:59:57| And I kind of agree, it has worked really, really well, maybe not so much in a Zoom setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14397)|
| 4:00:04| But in a regular meeting, it works really great. And as author Seymour always did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14404)|
| 4:00:11| he always addressed every comment that, and even other developers. So I am going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14411)|
| 4:00:19| I won't be able to support this. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner. Seeing no other comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14419)|
| 4:00:25| we have a motion by Commissioner Eason, seconded by Commissioner Korbelik to accept staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14425)|
| 4:00:31| recommendation on this amendment. Ms. Cairn, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14431)|
| 4:00:35| Yes, Mr. Chair. Commissioner Newton? Very light, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14435)|
| 4:00:41| Commissioner Eddie Smith? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14441)|
| 4:00:45| Commissioner Eason? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| Commissioner Buston? Very light, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14447)|
| 4:00:50| Commissioner Dent? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14450)|
| 4:00:54| Commissioner Roth? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14454)|
| 4:00:57| Commissioner Adams? Heavy, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14457)|
| 4:01:00| Commissioner Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14460)|
| 4:01:08| Is Commissioner Crowder still with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14468)|
| 4:01:15| Commissioner Crowder? We may have lost him. I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14475)|
| 4:01:20| There you are. I was just asking to unmute. Your vote, Commissioner Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14480)|
| 4:01:26| Yes. Thank you. Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14486)|
| 4:01:29| Yes. Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14489)|
| 4:01:33| After almost 19 years, no. Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14493)|
| 4:01:39| Yes. Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14499)|
| 4:01:42| No. Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14502)|
| 4:01:44| No. Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14504)|
| 4:01:48| No. I have six ayes and eight nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14508)|
| 4:01:59| Motion fails, so I guess we keep it as it is. Motion to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14519)|
| 4:02:06| Second. I make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14526)|
| 4:02:09| Adjourn. Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| Is there a second? Everyone have a good Christmas and be safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14531)|
| 4:02:17| and take care of yourselves and your families. See you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=14537)|
