| 0:00:29| Good morning. It's still morning. It's 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=29)|
| 0:00:34| Welcome, everyone, to the June Planning Commission Agenda Review Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=34)|

| 0:00:42| Chair Hill had a previous obligation that he couldn't get out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| and so you're stuck with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| We will start with a familiar face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=49)|

| 0:01:07| A few updates before we turn it over to our guest speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| Staff recently released the 2022 Development Activity Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| It has been promoted on our website and via a lead news article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| and it was apparently covered in last weekend's news sitinel, so you might have seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| Our research associate, Aubrey, will present it next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| and we'll also bring hard copies to that meeting for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| In other news, staff have been working with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| and City of Knoxville officials on implementation options to promote missing middle development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| You'll recall Aaron Gill presented on that recently to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| We are excited to see this work underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| Our agency also participated in the City of Knoxville's Open House Series this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| The fourth and final event was held last week for the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| It was hosted at Bearden Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| and planning brought staff to provide information to residents about transportation projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| to promote the many data tools that are on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| and planning's work has received a lot of positive feedback via this Open House Series| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| and appreciation from City of Knoxville officials, elected representatives, and many other citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| Now I'd like to introduce you to several new staff members that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| I'm going to go through the list, and if those that I call out, because we have quite a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| will stand up, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Madison Lewis has been working part-time with planning this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| She's part of the addressing team, and she just started full-time two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| We have been fortunate to have Madison help us while she's overlapping with Donna Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=161)|
| 0:02:48| who many of you may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Donna Hill retires after 31 years with the agency at the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| Shelly Gray joined the front desk team a few weeks ago, and we have two new planners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| Naomi Hansen joins the team from Washington State, and then we have Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| He joins us from Tulsa, Oklahoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| You'll see these new planners at upcoming meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| and we also have a summer in the city intern, Molly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| He's a student at the University of Tennessee focused on logistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| and is interested in learning more about the planning world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| So we are just really thrilled to have these team members with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Okay, so now I'll introduce Mr. Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| He's the government affairs and policy director for the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| where he leads the association's housing market research and public policy advocacy initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| And prior to working at Carr, Hansen was a research assistant at the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| For public policy, contributing to the center's research with the National Science Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| And in 2019, he also served as a research assistant to Mariana Wanamaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| and the White House's American Workforce Policy Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| So we're really glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| Awesome, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| And I'm going to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| So I gave you all a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| It's 40 pages long, so I'm condensing it to 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| So lots of economic trends were left out, but I encourage you to read it if you have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| So I will just go ahead and get started since there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| I like to start these presentations about what's really going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| So just broadly speaking, the economy and the housing market are cooling in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| but really not to the same extent as anywhere else in the country, particularly the West Coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| The West Coast is seeing some price declines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| We're starting to see things accelerate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| The second point is remember that low home price advantage that we always brand ourselves as having?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| It's completely gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| And I'll show you a slide later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| And then lastly, the pandemic provoked some structural shifts in the housing market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| or in other words, things that won't change year to year very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| And I have a couple of slides on that, but there's a lot more in the report itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| So I will go ahead and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| So just starting off, I took out the economic trends and we're just going to go into what's happening in the housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| So what happened in 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Residential home sales across the Knoxville area dropped 9% last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| That's the largest annual drop that we've had since the great financial crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| So very substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| And what is even more substantial is that virtually all of that drop happened in the third and fourth quarters of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| So it mostly happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| One quick question I want to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Is that in number of houses or in volume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Yes, number of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| So, you know, a very substantial drop and it all happened in late last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Secondly, home prices rose about 16.7%, which is one of the fastest pace of home price growth that we've seen in the region ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=343)|
| 0:05:52| with some of the more steep increases happening in some of the surrounding adjacent counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| But it was pretty substantial in Knoxville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Not too different there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| And then lastly, something that's important to mention is that we ranked number six for price growth last year in the entire United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=361)|
| 0:06:10| And this is not just a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Oh, everything's going to boom and bust and we'll be back to where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| We have, in fact, outpaced the national average in home price growth in every single quarter since 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| So this is a continuation of long term trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| Hanson, real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| When you say Knoxville, the city of Knoxville, Knox County, or the Knoxville MSA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| It is the Knoxville area, closer to the MSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| Is there any element of the slide previously where it's, you know, Knoxville's done this quarter after quarter that's catching up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=397)|
| 0:06:46| That we were, you know, we were so affordable that there's some component of just like getting up to where the rest of the market is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| There's a slide on it in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| It'll give you a bit of a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| So inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Inventory, you can see the blue bars are the Knox, is Knox County in particular, and then the orange is the Knoxville MSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| So you can see inventory did creep back up in mid-2022, but it's been falling and it's stayed relatively low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| Month supply, so the number of months it would take if we stopped listing housings, how long would it take us to run out of homes on the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| It's under one month, and six months is considered standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| So we're still really low on active listings and total inventory, and we don't think that's going to change all that much for a reason that I'll get to after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=445)|
| 0:07:34| But you can see there, you know, going back to 2016, we're, you know, a fourth of what we were inventory-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=454)|
| 0:07:42| So the price pressure will continue as long as we keep inventory this low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| And this is the really important graph that I think is fairly staggering to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| So the blue bar is Knoxville, the United States' average is up there, and orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| And so these are homes that are actively listed on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| So it's not sales, it's asking prices, but what's the median price of a home on the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| What you can see is we've always been relatively affordable, about $25,000 below the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| That has been the case, historically speaking, until mid-2022, when asking prices nationally started to drop, and Knoxville just continued to go upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=494)|
| 0:08:25| We're, you know, homeowners are not ready to take any less money for their property than they were in the height of the pandemic boom, and it's continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=505)|
| 0:08:34| And when you're in such a low inventory environment, it is, you know, feasible in a way that it wouldn't be otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| And so as of April of this year, our median listing price is $50,000 higher than the national average, which is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| So yes, we're catching up in many ways, but we're also just growing at a rate that is, you know, if we don't address it, will become a big problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=528)|
| 0:08:59| I know it's a really big topic of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| So this is looking at investor purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| To what extent are investors impacting our market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| So you can see that light blue bar is investor purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| The dark blue is cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Cash is not necessarily investor, but we did see an uptick in cash buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| It's really probably because of record equity levels, plus we're seeing a lot of migration from some of the high-income cities where, you know, you sell a $900,000 home and get the same home here for $400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=561)|
| 0:09:34| So a lot of people paying in cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| But what you can see is that investor share of purchases has risen, although not by too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| I mean, pre-pandemic, we were around 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| We're at 14%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| It's definitely had an impact, but has it had a market-level impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| I would argue no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| And this measure actually kind of overestimates investors because we can't tell the difference between a regular investor and an iBuyer who is buying and putting that home right back on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=593)|
| 0:10:06| And so it's not really taking away from the housing supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| And I will add to Freddie Mac and a couple of the National Association of Realtors have all put out research saying that investors have not had a market-level impact on pricing, and they typically offer less than what a typical owner-occupant would offer for a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=608)|
| 0:10:27| So looking at the rental market, this is also one of the fastest growing in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| And so this is just looking at what are change in effective rents for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| So what you can see here is nearly 20% year over year there in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| So really substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| And after looking back to pre-pandemic levels, rents on average are almost 50% higher than they were pre-pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=647)|
| 0:10:56| So the rental market has really blown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| Our occupancy rate, which I think I stripped out of the next slide, is hovering near 99%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| It is thankfully a little bit lower than that now, but we don't really foresee that it's going to drop all that substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| You really want your occupancy rate to be around 93 to 94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| We're expecting somewhere between 96 and 97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| And the next slide is really important as to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| This is the number of apartment units that are currently under construction in the Knoxville metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| I will say most of these are in Knox County and probably 75% of them are in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| So we're seeing a lot of apartment construction, which is really good considering that our apartment vacancy rate, our apartments are virtually full at 99%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=700)|
| 0:11:49| But you almost have 2,000 units that are currently under construction and scheduled to become available in the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| Will we see all of those hit the market in the next 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| It's still hard to find a dishwasher these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| And so supply chain challenges are still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| So we expect that these are going to sort of slowly come onto the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| But it should appreciably slow rent growth, which is really good news for renters, given that we had the highest rent growth in the United States in 2022, according to NAR analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=731)|
| 0:12:23| So really substantial on the rental side, which is important when we're talking about is this a supply problem or is it a bubble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=743)|
| 0:12:32| Our vacancy rates across the board are exceedingly low relative to similar cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| So a lot of this price growth is just a fact of we don't have enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| So what does this mean for affordability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| We measure it in a couple of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| This is a housing affordability index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| So at 100 means that a typical household can afford the medium priced home with a 10% down payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| And by that measure of affordability, housing affordability in the Knoxville Metro is at its lowest level since the 1980s, which is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=776)|
| 0:13:06| The 1980s is, in fact, when interest rates were at 18%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| So that is a huge part of the affordability challenge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| Now we're facing this double whammy of it's really hard to find a home at all, but it's really hard to find one that's affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=795)|
| 0:13:23| And so it's pushed affordability down in a substantial way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| So another method of this is what income, what amount of money do you need to purchase the home that was sold, the median home in 2021 versus 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=807)|
| 0:13:39| So this is showing you, you didn't see a huge, I mean, you saw a $45,000 increase in the median sale price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| So pretty substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| But what was most impactful was mortgage rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| And so you can see in 2021, around $56,000 would get you a median priced home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| And by the end of 2022, that was $89,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| And I use the joke that I didn't get a $33,000 raise last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| And I think most people probably didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| So it's not something that's easily weatherable for many different parts of our community, particularly teachers, police officers, some of the essential workers that we knew in the pandemic and realized how important they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=849)|
| 0:14:22| Those are the people that are increasingly pushed out of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| And so one of the last measures of affordability that's really important to understand is, you know, we measure affordability by what can you afford based off of the most recently sold house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=865)|
| 0:14:37| Well, you can't buy the most recently sold house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| So what is affordability relative to the homes that are actually listed on the market on any given day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| And what we found in that analysis, given some assumptions, is that if you make $75,000 or less in your household, you can afford about 15% of listings that are on the market in any given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=886)|
| 0:14:59| So that's two-thirds of the population who can afford only one-fifth of listings at the bottom end of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=899)|
| 0:15:08| So it's in part why the market continues to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| And you continue to hear realtors say things are crazy, in part because the bottom end of the market, under the $400,000 price point, there's a lot of movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=911)|
| 0:15:21| There's multi-offers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| It's softened at the top, but this bottom level has really not softened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| And we're continuing to see price growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| And lastly, I think I stripped a slide out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| So housing challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| What are we facing moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| This is our big estimate and the big takeaway from this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| So we modeled, we wanted to see what number of housing units are we, how many housing units are we short if we want to maintain our historic level of affordability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=942)|
| 0:15:53| And so we used a similar methodology as NAR, as Freddie Mac, as Rosen Consulting Group, which is a well-known housing consultancy group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=953)|
| 0:16:04| And what we found is that since the financial crisis, we have accrued somewhere between 22,000 and 25,000 housing units in terms of a shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=964)|
| 0:16:15| So we're short that many housing units if we want to maintain the level of affordability that Knoxville has had historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| Which is a really substantial number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| And you can see there, we're really just getting back up to the historical average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| So chipping away at that, you know, 20 plus thousand housing unit shortage will require us building above and beyond that orange line for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=989)|
| 0:16:40| So it is very substantial and something that if we want to continue to be the affordable place that we are or used to be in terms of house prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1000)|
| 0:16:50| we really have to figure out how we can deliver housing units in a cost-effective and efficient way that doesn't take all of our land and all of the natural beauty that is East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1010)|
| 0:17:02| And I added this one this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| I think it's one of the most interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| So this is just for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| And so part of the shortage really is, you know, we didn't build enough, but it's also a mismatch in demographic trends versus the type of housing we're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1027)|
| 0:17:18| And so households are getting smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Nearly a third of Knox County households consist of a single person and more than 60 percent are one or two person households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1041)|
| 0:17:31| And what the problem is, is that, you know, there's a mismatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| So only 12, you know, with a third of your population as single people and only 12 percent of your housing stock is studio or one bedroom housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1054)|
| 0:17:45| And so once you see, you know, we are the number of empty bedrooms in Knox County is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| And so in part of the affordability crisis, part of the shortage is that people who might be a one or two person household are forced to buy a home with extra space, not because they necessarily want or need the extra space, but because it's simply much harder to find a smaller home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1072)|
| 0:18:10| And we've seen because of the demand for smaller homes, particularly as our population ages, you have retirees who might not want a huge home, might not want a yard to take care of, or at least a large yard, aren't able to find that particular piece of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1090)|
| 0:18:26| In part because we put a lot of barriers into making those types of homes effective or buildable in a cost effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1106)|
| 0:18:35| And lastly, I will jump into this is my one slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| There's more in here about why there's some structural challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| This is the biggest point to take away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| This is something that's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| So this is looking at what is the distribution of outstanding mortgages in Tennessee by interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| And so once you do that analysis, eight in ten homeowners in the state of Tennessee are locked in with a rate below five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1133)|
| 0:19:02| So almost a point and a half, two points below current interest rates, which has created a lock in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| I speak from personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| I can't afford the home that I live in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| I could have not. If I was buying today, I would never be able to live where I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| And so it's locking people into their homes, particularly if you've made just enough money to afford your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| The prospect of giving up a 275 interest rate in exchange for a 6.5 interest rate is not attractive to most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1163)|
| 0:19:33| And, you know, and myself included, my mortgage payments would be, you know, in excess of a thousand dollars more relative to the interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1173)|
| 0:19:42| So a lot of people are locked in and staying put, which we foresee will keep a lot of homes off the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| And then the secondary impact of that is if people do decide to move, we expect to see an uptick in the number of people who hold on to that property as an investment rental property and buy another home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1188)|
| 0:20:03| In part because the interest rates are so cheap, it's cheap money, and those properties will cash flow in a way that if you had a 6.5 interest rate, you couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1203)|
| 0:20:14| So we think this is going to last quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| And as we all know, the predominance of a 30 year fixed rate loan means a lot of these numbers aren't going to change in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1216)|
| 0:20:25| And we were, you know, almost 60 percent of people have a rate below 4 percent, and that was less than 20 percent just 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| So this is a structural impact, something that we've never encountered in the history of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| So what happens could be a little ambiguous, but we expect it's going to keep people put for a good period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1239)|
| 0:20:49| And we're already sort of seeing that in our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| So this is active listings by year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| You can see active listings hit a record low in 2022 and in 2023, they're hitting a record low again across their respective month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1255)|
| 0:21:05| So we're already seeing an impact of people staying out of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| And even though inventory this spring has seen a nominal increase, it's really the result of homes staying on the market more for longer than they were previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1268)|
| 0:21:19| Homes are getting snapped up very quickly in the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Now they're not. And it's helping to pump up inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| But it's really limited how much inventory has actually grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| And we've we've seen it grow really, really nominally this year relative to past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| And I think that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| So our state of housing reports available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| I also we also have a monthly newsletter called Market Pulse that most of this information gets into before it gets into a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| And you also have a print copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| So I am thankful to be with you guys today and happy to answer any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1308)|
| 0:21:59| First of all, I'd like to say that's a fantastic report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| My one question would be, when was the average household income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| When was your latest figure for the average household income in East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| Twenty twenty one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Twenty twenty one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| So it's not taken into account the paralegal coming in from California that's making one hundred and eighty grand working from her house, whereas local job would be eighty grand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1337)|
| 0:22:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1348)|
| 0:22:28| We wanted in that analysis, our intent was to capture local residents rather than migrants to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1348)|
| 0:22:36| We wanted to really get at what's the affordability for people who are currently living here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| I think we did adjust that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Actually, I that I'm mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| That number was adjusted up to the fourth quarter of twenty twenty two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Actually, we partner with Moody's Analytics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| So we forecasted that based off of some of the income data that had been produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| So it's late twenty twenty two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| So it's mostly a local resident thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| I mean, we do know from from some data that the number of people coming people out of town are purchasing more expensive homes and generally have a higher income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| So it is overweighted towards local residents rather than the migrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| OK, that's all I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| Thanks for great to be with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Thanks, Hanson. Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Are you doing this with county commission and city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Yes, we already did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Great. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Next, we're going to go through the agenda items that staff has picked to put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| And the first one is item number twenty one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Knoxville, Knox County planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I'll start this off, but then I've asked Jeff to also be here to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| So as you all may recall, this came before you last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| It's actually the last last fall and then city council had reviewed it to November and then remanded it back to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1433)|
| 0:24:03| But before that, they wanted to have a city council workshop, which was held on April 27th, which planning staff attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1443)|
| 0:24:11| So we don't have a presentation today for you, but just wanted to make you aware that this is coming back for you this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| If you have any questions about that city council workshop or there was a small public meeting that was held by council member Tommy Smith that was attended by staff, staff would be happy to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1457)|
| 0:24:30| I'll refer to Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1470)|
| 0:24:46| Mr. Phillips, could you speak in the mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| What was city council's concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| I think they just wanted to get more background on the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| You know, where were there opportunities and what kinds of problems that have occurred with development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| So codes provided some examples of where some development met the bill to set back guidelines and where some asked for variances or zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1502)|
| 0:25:13| So that was primarily it that they had those concerns with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| And so there's really no direction that they gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| The administration continues to be supportive, at least the Department of Economic Development for the city is supportive of the Planning Commission's recommendation that you all passed in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1522)|
| 0:25:35| And as a sidebar, when I bought my first house in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, some of you may remember the interest rates back in the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| Thirteen percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| There was a slide presentation at the city council workshop that might be good to send out to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1545)|
| 0:25:56| I think we sent out with your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| It's included in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Yeah, because it had the examples of the cases that the yes or BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| So they didn't come up with any revisions after that workshop because it sounded like they were each going to maybe have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| No, not at the meeting itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| And we did, you know, tell them that when it was coming for you, I sent out an email saying, hey, if you have any comments, revisions, and Councilman Smith had a community meeting that Mike attended with some of the businesses along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1575)|
| 0:26:29| Yeah. The administration spoke of this as almost like a temporary fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| Yeah. And also in looking at some sort of longer term change around these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| Yeah. Any idea on what would that include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| Like small area plans or corridor studies, sort of like the Bearden Village study or what would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| Yeah, I'm not sure specifically what the recommendation that we have a slide of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| So basically it was to revisit the districts on a community by community basis during fiscal year 23, 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| And so I address any of the current standards that maybe need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| So it's how much the city administration wants to tackle this upcoming fiscal year and whether that's going to be a high priority or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| But that was sort of part of the recommendation for that to have more community public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| I've got a question along those same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Can you sort of provide what a timeline would be like if the result is this passing and then communities are asked to have small area plans to impact areas that weren't included in this or there are oddities and need some different treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1644)|
| 0:27:50| What's the process for a community doing that and what is the timeline for that actually taking effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| That has not been discussed with the city administration and codes as far as how to proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| It could be done on a corridor basis similar to what Councilman Smith did for his corridor for Chapman Highway and bring the businesses, property owners together that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1682)|
| 0:28:12| That may be a potentially way to do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| So what Councilman Smith did was simply raising the issue, asking people, what do you think, what are the perspectives out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1696)|
| 0:28:28| I'm asking about beyond that, if that community, his or any others, decided that they did see some issues with this and that they did want to have some kind of small area plan to affect certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1708)|
| 0:28:41| What's the process for that and how long does that actually take to implement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| That will take several months to close to a year depending on the staff work program that we as planning has and how many requests there are for that type of approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1727)|
| 0:29:01| And again, this is a zoning district that covers the entire city so you wouldn't really want to just change it by corridor by corridor either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| I was looking at Nashville's zoning code last night and their build two zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| Basically, it seems like their fix to it is to just create design overlays along certain corridors, which seems like it could be easy to fill into our code, have a Bearden Village design overlay or West Hills, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1754)|
| 0:29:35| Really, the city needs to invest in a new general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| And that should have been done before we did a new zoning code, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| Maybe following the county's model, do a general plan first and then zoning later, but we went backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1783)|
| 0:29:51| If there's a way that this commission can recommend to city council that they move forward with a new general plan, that would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1791)|
| 0:30:01| I have a question about the design overlay concept and how that differs from a small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| And that's for staff or whomever feels qualified to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Their code references multiple things where it's basically a build two zone would be, it's kind of like an order of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| First, it's if there's a design overlay and if there's not a design overlay, then it references a small area plan to kind of cascade what neighborhoods have come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1820)|
| 0:30:32| You can think of the South Waterfront code or the Cumberland Avenue code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| It's very specific to an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| It has specific regulations associated with just that geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1839)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Number 22, city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| And I think Peter or Chris, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| I'm not 100% sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Either Mr. Halley or Director Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| Child was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| How you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1873)|
| 0:31:13| Peter Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| I'm the Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| This amendment comes from my house, but we work really closely with Development Services Engineering because they regulate land as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1877)|
| 0:31:29| So most of the comments, a lot of it is providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Most of this is just providing additional clarity and moving definitions to their appropriate location within the zoning code, but I'm going to defer to Mr. Howley to get into the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1894)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Hopefully this is tall enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| In general, we have a stormwater and street ordinance that also regulates land development and city council had reached out to us and asked us if we could look at one aspect of when we are willing to sign off on a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1915)|
| 0:32:10| And a lot of that has to do with this idea of a lot of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| And some people have heard about ward maps and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| A lot of that's been deemed as a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| In a lot of development of the past, we have projects where we have a house built, for instance, on a particular piece of property and you look at one of our maps and it shows a lot line that runs down the middle of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1939)|
| 0:32:32| You look at a different map, like a tax map versus a ward map, and they show something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| And that clarification and correction of those concepts were something that we were asked to look in by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| And a number of changes that we have proposed in our stormwater and street ordinance dovetail with what you're seeing proposed in the zoning ordinance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1965)|
| 0:32:55| Some of the definitions that are in this, they don't say the same thing as what we have in a different ordinance that is probably what I'd call the hierarchical ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1975)|
| 0:33:06| So part of this is to clarify and make sure that they are saying the same thing and we're referring to the same details, the same definitions, the same tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| Other aspects of it are the way it's defined in this particular version gives us a certain degree of flexibility, but the definition doesn't make sense and it kind of is a little bit contrary to what the other ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=1994)|
| 0:33:28| And so the goal would be to move the flexibility into an area that makes more sense and create continuity between the two ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2008)|
| 0:33:38| At the end of the day, the goals are essentially that in certain circumstances where we have records that pre-existed prior to the formation of the planning department, before the register of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2018)|
| 0:33:52| the city has a lot of older areas of town where we have maps that were produced in a timeline that were not as well recognized under today's standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2032)|
| 0:34:02| And so this flexibility gives us the option to be able to issue building permits to areas that were done in the method for recording lots in their day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2042)|
| 0:34:13| So things that were done 200 years ago, we still want to recognize those because they were done as opposed to making them go through a full modern process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| And so that's the gist of what the intent and the goals were behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2072)|
| 0:34:40| Next is item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Rezoning request and Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2084)|
| 0:35:02| Hello, Jesse Hillman, senior planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2102)|
| 0:35:14| This request item number nine is 6C23RZ, it's a 1.54 acre property on Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2114)|
| 0:35:23| Sorry if you can't see that main screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| It's thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| This is at the base of Sharpe's Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| The rezoning request is to go from RN1 to RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| Valley View Drive is a major collector street with a CAT bus route and the property is near the intersection of Fairway Road, which is a minor collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2143)|
| 0:35:52| The property is also within the boundaries of the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2152)|
| 0:36:02| The property has a former planned district overlay that is to be removed since there was never a development plan submitted under its prior planned residential RP1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2162)|
| 0:36:13| There was a KGIS error that identified this overlay as a planned development instead of a former planned district, and this will be corrected in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2173)|
| 0:36:21| As you can see, there is RN1 zoning in the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| RN2 zoning is nearby, and there are more intensive residential zoning districts nearby to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| The most recent change of conditions worth noting began about 16 years ago with the development of the, what's the laser pointer, the Willow Place condominiums here and the Heritage Park subdivision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2194)|
| 0:36:51| These both began around 16 years ago, but Heritage Park was completed within the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| Even though Willow Place is zoned RN3, it's developed with duplexes at a density that's equivalent to RN2, and none of these more intensive zoning districts here are built out to their maximum allowable density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2217)|
| 0:37:13| The land use classification in the East City Sector Plan is medium density residential, which permits consideration of RN1 through RN4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2233)|
| 0:37:30| As you can see, there are a range of housing forms in the area with single family, two family townhomes, and multifamily developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| However, the subject property is part of a consistent row of single family detached homes with forested backyards leading to the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2257)|
| 0:37:49| Staff is recommending RN2 zoning over RN4 at this location. RN2 is more consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2269)|
| 0:37:58| The minimum lot standard for multifamily development in RN4 could permit up to 33 units with special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2278)|
| 0:38:07| RN2 still enables a moderate increase in density with a 5,000 square foot lot size for single family development, and it has special use review for duplexes with a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2287)|
| 0:38:20| A rezoning from RN1 to RN2 here promotes residential infill in an area where there is capacity for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| Amenities include transit, community activity centers in the forms of public parks and a middle school, as well as nearby commercial nodes in both directions on Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2308)|
| 0:38:40| RN2 also balances infill with oversight over duplex housing form. I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| Jesse, can you go back to the slide that had...one more. One more. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| It seems...I guess, can you just say a little bit more about the choice to suggest RN2 for that particular parcel when it's completely surrounded by RN1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2336)|
| 0:39:11| There are...I see that the RN2's on, you know, sort of diagonals there, but they're not contiguous and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| Yeah. So, in part, it is because of the residential amenities in the area. There's a bus stop that's walking distance at this corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2358)|
| 0:39:29| It's on a major collector near a minor collector. It's near commercial nodes. There's the Richard Leak Public Park and the Alice Bells Pool that are walking distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2369)|
| 0:39:44| So, for those reasons, it was seen that there was capacity in terms of the residential benefits of the area to consider RN2 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2384)|
| 0:39:56| And did I hear you say that this piece was RP1 at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| What was the zoning...what was the density on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| It was never...a development plan was never submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| Okay. Was there a range then, back then? There would have been a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| There was a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| A density range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| I remember off the top of my head. I have to look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Let me see. I can look it up in KJS one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| That would be in the old code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2428)|
| 0:40:39| When Mike gets back, he might remember off the top of his head. Mike, do you recall what the RP1...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| On Valley View, the density, the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| For RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| I want to say it was up to like 12 millionths breaker. It was pretty high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| While they're looking, does anyone know if comments...I know that I've read at least three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2455)|
| 0:41:09| but are any of them from persons who own property directly next to this, or are they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2469)|
| 0:41:18| None of them have identified themselves as direct neighbors that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2478)|
| 0:41:34| Jesse, the sector plan shows it is medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| and so within medium density, anything from RN2 to RN4 was acceptable, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| And that would have supported that RP1 that I was asking about earlier with the higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| was where I was going with that, just to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Yeah, 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Yeah, that's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| All right. Anybody got anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| All right. Moving on. Item number 20, 6B23SU. Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2526)|
| 0:42:15| This is...Oh, I apologize for the mislabel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| This is a city special use for a 0.78 acre parcel at the corner of North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| a major arterial, and Edgewood Avenue, a minor collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| The special use request is for a drive-through facility for a cookout restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| which is a fast food chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| There is a CAT bus stop at the northwest corner of the property right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2556)|
| 0:42:46| There is also the First Creek Greenway Trail, which you can see in green here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| that goes up North Broadway and crosses over on Edgewood Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| and terminates at the Edgewood Park and the library there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| And this property is included in the Edgewood Park neighborhood boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| This lot is zoned CG2, general commercial, and it's part of a CG2 corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| which is intended to promote mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| in a pedestrian-oriented environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Indoor commercial operations should be the primary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| with limited exceptions per special use approval, such as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| The property is also part of an infill housing overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| which doesn't apply to commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| but does reflect a prioritization of neighborhood character and stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| in the Edgewood Park neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| The CG2's dimensional standards require a corner-side build-to-zone of 0 to 10 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| meaning the building should be near the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| which promotes pedestrian accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| The applicant requested a variance from this zoning standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| in order to set the building back 30.5 feet, as you can see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| It's set back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| This request was denied by the Board of Zoning Appeals last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Part of the rationale for the denial was that the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| does not provide walkable access from Edgewood Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| which conflicts with the CG2's district's pedestrian orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| Currently, the property is a vacant bank building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| that had teller drive-thrus exiting onto North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| You can see the bank is set closer to Edgewood Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| and there is pedestrian access to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| This property is in an area where there is a concentration of fast food drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| There's a KFC adjacent to the north and a Wendy's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| and then a McDonald's and Burger King in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| This property is part of the Broadway mixed-use special district designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| in the East City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| This designation describes how the Broadway corridor changed significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| after the establishment of the Federal Highway Administration in the 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| It used to have a trolley line and was transit-oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| with slower travel speeds and shallower setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| This changed to a road designed primarily for cars with larger setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| vast parking lots, and higher travel speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| The plan describes a goal to improve walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| support transit ridership, reduce parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| and buffer commercial and residential uses, as well as calming traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| It's also noteworthy that the property falls partially within the 500-year floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| as you can see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| and that was the primary reason cited by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| for the build-to zoning variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| to set the building back outside of the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| We are recommending approval subject to eight conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| several of which support transit walkability and residential buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| This case has been controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| with residents setting concerns about the impact of another fast-food drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| on their community's character and traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| The conditions included in the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| are intended to bring the site plan more into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| with the intent of the CG2 Zoning District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| as well as the Mixed-Use Special District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| One benefit of the plan is that it replaces two driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Those two teller driveways are removed and replaced with new sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| as you can see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| so that does improve walkability and pedestrian safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| A CAT bus stop is currently located there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| and it has no seating amenities currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| so one condition is to provide a seating amenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| such as a semi-seat, as you see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| This would be provided in coordination with CAT operations staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| and this semi-seat is part of their bus stop improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| The site plan currently exceeds its parking space minimum by 12 spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| and another condition is to remove the six parking spots on the eastern border| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| and replace that with a Class B landscaping buffer, which is 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| in addition to the existing proposed fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| There's also a six- to eight-foot fence conditioned along this alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| to protect this residential property from incoming drive-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Lastly, the building entrance along Edgewood Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| is currently inaccessible from the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| You can see there's landscaping here currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| so there's a condition that this be made accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| to the Edgewood Avenue sidewalk with patio seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| This would make it more of an amenity to the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| This open-space seating amenity is mentioned in the rules of measurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| in the zoning ordinance for the Bill 2 Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| as a feature that can be counted towards the Bill 2 Zone percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| I had discussions with Plans Review and Inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| and they would consider this patio seating as a potential way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| to reduce that variance that was requested for the Bill 2 Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| There is precedent for cookout-providing outdoor seating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| as you can see in this picture here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| And with the conditions noted, this would be more supportive of transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| pedestrians, and the adjacent residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| The variances at BZA, would they have to go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| Currently, they are considering appealing it to City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| I think they're waiting to see how special use review goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| If we approve this special use, did they reject all of the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| or just the one where there is now a patio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| There was only one variance requested at the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| So it would be approved then, essentially, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| It would depend on how it's designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| and making sure that it's compatible with how Plans Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| and Inspections assesses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| Okay. Thank you, Jessie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Next is item number 30, Concept and Development Plan, Whitney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2969)|
| 0:49:59| Okay, so this is a development concept plan for 47 attached lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| on 7.87 acres along Old Clinton Pike near West Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| It's less than a quarter mile from a shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| and a middle school on West Emery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| This property is currently pending a rezoning at six dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| which includes a condition for providing a Type B landscape screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| along the agricultural zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| and that means buffer strips should be a minimum of 12 feet in width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| and these 47 lots will create a density of 5.98 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| Now, there is one alternative design standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| that requires Planning Commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| The applicant is requesting a reduction in the lot frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| from 25 feet down to 22 feet for the attached units on individual lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| This request requires that guest parking be provided within the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| This site is located within a parental responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| and it's less than a quarter mile from a shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| so installing a sidewalk along the frontage of Old Clinton Pike will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3074)|
| 0:51:23| Oops, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| And one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| The Planning Commission also determines the height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| for anything other than houses or duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| so staff's recommending a maximum height of 35 feet for the attached units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| which would be consistent with the surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| and also recommending approval with all these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| What's the criteria you're using to justify going from 25 feet to 22 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| Sorry, can you say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| What's the criteria that staff is using to go from 25 feet to 22 feet for the frontage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| It's allowed within our subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| and it's getting a few more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| just getting up to that density that's allowed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Then if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| why don't we just change the regulations to allow 22 feet wide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| I mean, we're getting kind of arbitrary and capricious here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| I say the subregs require, sorry, it's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| Well, it says that guest parking should be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| if lots have less than 25 feet of frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| and that's kind of a subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| There's nothing that says how much parking is supposed to be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| so we want this to come to the Planning Commission for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| if they go less than 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| But as an alternative design standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| the Planning Commission can approve down to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Anything less than 20 feet would be considered a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| and that's where hardships become more of a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| Typically, variances are based on issues of property, topographic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| Yeah, and that's why this is an alternative design standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| This is an alternative design standard going from 25 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Anything below 20 is a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3206)|
| 0:53:36| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Number 35, development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Whitney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| This is for a multifamily development along Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| east of Bob Kirby Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| There are sidewalks currently along Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| and a commercial node less than a quarter mile to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| So per the county's sidewalk ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| the sidewalk will be required from the development to Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| and this development will be 128 units on 11 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| which would be 11.7 dwelling units an acre on this PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| up to a 12 dwelling units an acre property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| So looking at the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| these 128 units will cover five different apartment buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| including a clubhouse and a pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| There is an extensive landscape plan that will go along the frontage in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| and it will also go around the property that's adjacent to these single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| family residence subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| This section of Middlebrook Pike is in the designated scenic highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| which requires maximum height for buildings to be 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| This is an image of one of their three-story buildings that are just under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| the maximum height of 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| So we are recommending approval with these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3306)|
| 0:55:14| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you, Whitney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Next one is item number 31 and 32, Cruz Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3329)|
| 0:55:43| Okay, and I'm going to let the big screen come on here in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| but this is a bit of a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| We did accept this as two separate applications because it really is two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| independent subdivisions, even though it's under the same developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| And because it was being done at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| we did ask for a traffic impact study because they did go over the 750 trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| And I'll show you a bit more detail on which property is which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| but the Cruz Farm subdivision is on the east side, on the right side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| has 62 lots, and the other on the left has 55 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| They're all attached units varying in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| Some of them are less than 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| Some of them are more like 34, 35 feet, I believe, wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| So it is as you see it is just going to turn on the laser pointer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3393)|
| 0:56:43| So it is really close to the school campus here as well as other amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| So one variance to note is that they are requesting an intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| separation for the Cruz Farm subdivision, which is on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| On Arterial Street, the intersection separation is required to be 400 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| They basically put their intersection between the two on the opposite side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| the street, so 290 feet to one side, 310 feet to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| Staff is recommending approval with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| So this is just a quick overview of the two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| So on the aerial, what you see in red on the right corresponds with the Cruz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| Farm subdivision on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| And again, more like the mustardy yellow color on the left kind of gives you an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| idea of where it's located on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| There is a wetland that separates the two, and there's a substantial steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| slope area on the south side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| They do intend to maintain a good part of that sloped area and the vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3462)|
| 0:57:50| which you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| It's kind of hard to see here, but the green dashed line is approximate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| location of the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| The kind of purple line here is their approximate disturbance limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3479)|
| 0:58:07| So there you see that there is a good amount of land being left undisturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| on the steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| They do propose a walking trail between the two subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| There is an amenity area on the western side back here at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| They don't detail what that amenity is, but they do say they intend to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| an amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| And, again, just to give you an idea of some of the context here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| they're off to the east of the school campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| There is a mid-block crossing on Hardin Valley and also a sidewalk crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| or crosswalk at the intersection with Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| There is a small commercial node, including the food city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| and some unbuilt commercial veterinary offices existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| And this area here is 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| It was originally approved by the Planning Commission for 133 attached lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| I'm not sure if that's still the case, and I assume it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| They are getting closer to actually building that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| Just to point out some things in the northwest county sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| it does have Hardin Valley community discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| It talks about updating the growth policy plan to extend the planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| area where utilities are provided now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| Obviously utilities are much more extensive in this area than they used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| You know, cul-de-sac should be avoided where possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| On this site, unfortunately, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| There's really no opportunity for connectivity, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| Everything around it is built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| And it talks about conservation subdivisions as being a recommended type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| I mean, I wouldn't say that this is a conservation subdivision per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| but it does have those principles of clustering units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| which I think was the intent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| The Hardin Valley mobility plan, which is from 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| two items that are essentially the same item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| but it's just different alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| It talks about potential widening or improvements to Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| One of those is to potentially widen it to two lines each direction with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| The other is to do more of a landscape median down the middle of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| That's still something that's pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| but I would suspect some type of improvement over time to Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| will be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| Mike, what does pending mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| Pending means it will happen sometime in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| I don't know if Johnny has any idea of improvements to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| I mean, we have a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| I mean, it's a lot out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| And, you know, it moves slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| So like Hardin Valley, is there anything in the line for Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3670)|
| 1:01:19| Not on this particular section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| We probably, as part of our advanced NOx process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| we may be looking at some capacity improvements west of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| But right now, this particular section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| we don't have anything on the agenda at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| Getting back to the cruise farm subdivision variance request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| this outlines, again, how that's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| So their entrance road, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| is almost evenly split between the two subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| They will need to do a little bit of restriping on the center turn lane in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Hardin Valley to create a dedicated left turn lane into their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| That will leave enough space for the left turn lane queuing at the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| Brighton Farms Boulevard to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| There's really no changes that are needed to the west at the Brook Willow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| In this section of Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| there is an existing center turn lane versus to the west where the Maya| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| Hills subdivision does not have a center turn lane right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| So they're going to have to restripe to create that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| It's kind of hard to see in this image,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| but it's pretty evident when you're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| There is a fairly significant bank just in front of this Brighton Farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| We did ask the engineer, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| why not just line up these intersections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| It's pretty obvious why they didn't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| but there are some underground utilities that are pretty high in that bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| It makes it challenging to put that intersection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| At the proposed intersection or access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| there was not a concern from staff from a safety perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| They felt they could get the site distance that's required and the queuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| links that are required on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| So we were recommending approval of those requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3799)|
| 1:03:27| Just trying to go through this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| I just mentioned that they need to restripe in front of the Cruz Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| intersection or access point further to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| It's going to be a little bit hard to see on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| but you can see them in the PDF plans maybe a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| This section of road, you can kind of see it down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| the center turn lane goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| So they will need to restripe to push the travel lanes out towards the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| curbs, put in that center turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| and just restripe a little bit towards the queuing lanes at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3837)|
| 1:04:06| Anybody have any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| Similar to the last one we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| I didn't really go into the design too much of the subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| but they do have some lots that are smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| So they are less than 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| I think they are down to 20, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| And they do have some bigger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| So as I mentioned, the subregs say it should provide guest parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| On this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| we felt that there was enough opportunity for on-street parking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| accommodate any guest parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| It's a bigger unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| so there's going to be space between these units to actually have on-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| There might be some other opportunities for on-street parking as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| versus the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| Not that they'll see it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| but they actually do have some dedicated parking in the kind of mid-block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| And then they said they will also have some more dedicated on-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| parking back at the amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| I'm sorry, off-street parking at the amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| And similar to the previous subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| they do have wider units that would accommodate on-street parking between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| driveways as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Is it possible to define what that amenity might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| We can ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Appropriate question to ask the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| And that during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| It's just seems curious that it wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3926)|
| 1:05:40| In the plan that we're being asked to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| It has to do with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| It's not specifically required to be defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| just that there's one that is an area that is not specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| required to be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Required to be defined just that there is one that is an area that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| identified or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Opportunity for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Next item number 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Domo plan like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| So I'll go over this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| This property was rezoned to plan residential up to 8.2 to alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| It was owned agricultural prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| I believe they reckon or requested 10 staff recommended 10 as plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| commission recommended 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Essentially they just didn't need 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| They needed 8.2 to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| I think their project is just barely under 8.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| Dwellings breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| It is on shot road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| They do have access to shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Technically they do have frontage on ball camp pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| but they are not providing any access to ball camp bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| So I think that pretty much covers what I was going through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| So this site has been disturbed previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| unfortunately, because there is a stream that cuts through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| So you can see there's no vegetation left along that stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| There's also a wetland towards the ball camp pike road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| The,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| there was a condition of the rezoning to provide a type B landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| screening along agricultural properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| this was intended for the residential properties just to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Southeast and to the West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| So staff is recommending that just as the condition requires a type B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| landscaping along the West and along the East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| most Southeast property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| And they don't show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| they show the Western one on their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| They do not show this Southeastern planting area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| landscape screen area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| But because of the stream was just have to work out how that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| It just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| as long as there's landscape screening between the units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| like their development and the property to the Southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| that's all I would be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| The placement of those would just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| we'll have to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| with them during the permitting phase and their grading plans and such to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| see where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| where that landscaping actually ultimately ends up to the East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| It's kind of hard to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| but it's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| there's a church over on the East side that was just built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| It is on agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| I think it makes sense for them to go ahead and provide some screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| It's not part of the condition of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| I need to put this in the back cause I realized it wasn't in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| They did provide a couple of examples of types of units that they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| propose to construct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| When I talk to people about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| they usually don't know exactly what they want to build yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| give me something that gives you a sense for scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| And so this is what they gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| so it could be something that's similar to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| Hopefully it's some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| something along the lines that we see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| But really the scale is the big part for me and what I want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| And I knew it was going to be probably a two story structure as they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| I think they're showing duplexes for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| And I think there's two detached structures in here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| And then this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| did they get the utilities worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| I imagine there's still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| I think there was a pretty heated conversation as to where there's sewer or not out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I'm sure that they're working that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| But that's a condition I'm assuming of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| they have to work with the utility districts to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| usually the first condition in our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Can't really get too far without the utilities on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| Item number 41,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| So this one was before us last month for a similar use determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| Maybe it was two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| I can't recall now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| Maybe it was two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| It's a metals and plastics reclamation facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| We were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| it didn't really fit within any of the land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| so we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| we were making a determination of really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| whether in the industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| this use should be a use permitted on review or permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| And ultimately it landed on use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| So this is in the Forks of the River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| It is on the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| I'll show you a zoning map here in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| but everything around this is zoned industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| which is the heaviest zoning classification in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| So from that perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| the land use makes sense here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| One,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| I just totally left the plain PR zoning on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| My,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| I was obviously a little bit quick to get through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| So look on the right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Don't look in the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| this is a recommendation for approval with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| So look at the bottom on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| So this is their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| their site plan there originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| So when we saw it previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| they were thinking of having a building on the upper left-hand corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| which was closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| much closer to Asbury road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| They decided to push that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| in doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| they decided to not go with the building anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| Now they're just going to have a concrete pad with their equipment sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| on their processing equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| sitting on that pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| One of the concerns was noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| They do tend to still use the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| the ball mills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| which I was concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| They have their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| their default practice is to use a ball mill with a neoprene liner on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| which reduces the noise substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| So between the distance away from the road and the neoprene interior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| that should take care of most of the noise concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| There's also other types of insulation they can do from the outside of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| ball mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| They are working on their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| on a separate proprietary process that does not require a ball mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| At this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| they don't know if it's going to be ready for the construction of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| So they're going forward with the idea of the ball mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| The other process does not include anything like a ball mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| It's going to be a lot less noisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| They didn't really tell me exactly what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| but it did not include a round tube with balls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| heavy steel balls bouncing off of metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| So hopefully they can get that installed instead of the ball mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| but I'm not too concerned with how they're moving forward with this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| are they currently doing this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| They have several operations around the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| like I know at least in the Southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| I'm sure they're bigger than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| but yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| they do have similar operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| So just on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| just like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| show you the zoning map on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| It's all heavy industrial around here as there's concrete plants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| like trucking terminals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| steel or metals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| recycling companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| So it's a pretty intense area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| There are two houses right across the street and there are a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| three houses down the way to the Southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| The industrial zone has a standard that says if you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| that you're permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| you cannot be within 300 feet of a residential unit that is zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| agriculturally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| or I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| not agriculturally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| zoned in a residential zone district or in a residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| These properties are neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| They're not in a residential subdivision and they're not zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| They have a pretty detailed operations description in their packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| So if you want to peruse that to see how they operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| that's a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4447)|
| 1:14:14| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| Next is item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4462)|
| 1:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| So the first one I have to talk about today is a street closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| which we don't usually have an occasion to talk about at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| And this is a request to close the acres road right away in front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| last two properties on acre street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| As you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| it's pretty short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| It only extends from Haywood Avenue down three parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| The applicant owns these two parcels here and would like to close this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| right away to retain use of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| The zoning map shows that the property across the street is not privately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| And they're working with the city of Knoxville to obtain both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| So typically when we close a right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| it gets divided in half with each side going ownership to the property on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| So they're trying to get ownership of the entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| The issue with this one is if we did allow closure of acre street and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| applicant did retain property and add that to her parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| she's planning essentially creates a situation where you have a landlocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| lot in this bottom parcel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| So acre street would avert to this one and then revert to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| And then this one would no longer have road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| That's a requirement of the subdivision regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| So it would be creating a nonconforming situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| We could condition it that the applicant plat the property and provide an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| easement to the rear property, but there's no guarantee that that would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| There's not really right now a mechanism when they're going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| building permit process for them to be looking at conditions of street closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| So it's likely that that would get lost in translation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| So what we're recommending is closure of this last parcel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| And what that would do is basically have that lock the road frontage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| So it's got, it's required frontage along acres along this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| The owner still retains the frontage along this part and they can still use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| They're using the parking along here and that wouldn't change with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| So that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| we've notified the applicant and they'll be able to make their case to you if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| they disagree with the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| Would that change the desire of that person for the row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| the chunk that is not owned at the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| I'm sorry, I'm not sure you understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| If you go back, this is your recommendation slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| but if you go back a couple and you show how the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| one more there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| the right side blob that they're trying to acquire that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| Oh no, I'm sorry. They're just trying to acquire this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| but because this isn't privately owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| they would be able to retain both sides of the right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4637)|
| 1:17:27| Okay. So the next one is number 26 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| It's 6H23RZ. This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| They're requesting to go from agricultural to PR with a density of up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Planning is recommending 3.5 dwelling units per acre with the condition that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| the portion of the parcel with slopes of 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| 25% or greater be left undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| And we'll kind of get into that in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| The aerial map just kind of shows contextually what's going on in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| There is a subdivision built out here. This is a mobile, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| RV park. And then this is mobile homes and mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| Right now East Raccoon Valley Drive is classified as a major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| so no traffic would be routed through smaller residential neighborhoods to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| reach this site. Although Raccoon Valley Drive is pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| It's only 19 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| Sector plan map shows this property designated as LDR, which as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| allows consideration of up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| The zoning map shows a mix of zoning in the area, predominantly agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| but there's also RA, PR up to 3.5, some commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| industrial zoning over here at the interchange to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| So this is kind of the basis for our recommendation of 3.5 per acre versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| requested five is just to be more in character with what's going on in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| site or in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| And this is a bird's eye view that kind of shows a little bit more clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| what the build out currently looks like in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| So really aside from the RVs and the mobile homes, it's, it's pretty rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| pretty low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| There are some site constraints right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| There is a blue line stream coming through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| So the applicant will be required to work with TDEC if they want to cross the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| streams. And there's also some pretty significant slope on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| So the rear of the site goes along this ridge line that comes through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| It's like a longer ridge system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| And so a good part of the rear portion of the site has 25% or greater slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| And so the slope analysis recommends a disturbance area of maximum of 2.96| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| within the HV portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| And so that 2.73 dwelling units per acre that it's also recommending the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| combination of those two yields 36 dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| The requested five dwelling units per acre could result up to 62 dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| and then planning's recommendation of 3.5 dwelling units per acre could result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| in up to 43. So just as a comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| And again, just like we mentioned earlier, due to the adverse impacts that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| could result from clearing and grading these significant slopes at the rear of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| the property, we're requiring for them to, or proposing a condition to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| them to leave that portion of the site undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| Also because of the number of dwelling units, depending on what they do end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| with, if it goes over 70 dwellings, they would need to have some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| traffic study. That would be determined later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| Any questions about that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| Okay, last one is number 27 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Uh-oh, lost a screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Okay, so this one, they're also asking for ag up to five dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| acre and similar to the last one, we're recommending 3.5 with that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| The aerial map of the area, it's a pretty big piece of property and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| some subdivision build outs along through here, but very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| Looking at this, oh sorry, and the Nappello Road is also a classified road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| similar to the last one, but it also is very narrow, 19 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| Sector plan has it as LDR and it's also in the HP area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| And then the zoning, you've got 2.1 dwelling units per acre down here, 3.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| here, and then this is Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Across that is four dwelling units per acre, so even though that's higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| because it's across Norris Freeway, it feels very disconnected from this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| somewhat disjointed, and so we're recommending 3.5 to be closer in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| with what's going on down here with the RA and 3.1 in the near vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| This is a bird's eye view of the property here, just to give you a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| more context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| And again, some severe slopes on a smaller portion of the site, so both rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4906)|
| 1:21:53| corners have that 25% or higher, so there's that same condition for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| leave those undisturbed due to the adverse impacts that could result from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| clearing and grading the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| The slip recommended disturbance area is 24.58 acres out of the total 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4923)|
| 1:22:16| and it recommends a density of 2.65 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| So when you combine that, it gets you to 106 dwelling units, potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| and compare that with the requested five dwelling units per acre, which could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| result up into 200 dwellings, and then planning's recommended 3.5 dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| units per acre, which could result in up to 140 new dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| And that would definitely require a traffic impact analysis scope determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| to see what they're going to do and what road improvements, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| would be required at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Any questions about that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| Well, that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| Any other items that commissioners have to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| Chris, I've got something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| I've got a call today on item number seven, which I'm surprised it's not on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| our list today to discuss, because the staff's recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| I'm just curious if Jesse could kind of brief us a little bit on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| This is for Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=4998)|
| 1:23:49| Yes, I'm glad you brought this one up, because we are recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| It was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5035)|
| 1:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5058)|
| 1:24:48| Okay, so this request is to go from the MDRO, Medium Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5088)|
| 1:25:07| Office, sector plan designation to an extension of this mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5107)|
| 1:25:17| special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| That's part of the central city sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| And this would allow for a rezoning to the CG2 commercial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5124)|
| 1:25:40| We determined to deny this because it would be an intensive encroachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| into this residential area, which is still residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| There is a trailer park here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| These are single-family lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| There's a duplex here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| I do believe Mr. Jernigan is planning to share his concept for what he'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| like to do here, which is residential in nature, but because we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| consider all the potential uses with the commercial zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| we determined it was an intrusive encroachment into this residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| Also in the sector plan, it described how further study would be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| if this mixed-use district were to be extended, and that has not occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| So for those reasons, we recommend a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5188)|
| 1:26:36| Is there any other zone that the owner could consider where he could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| accomplish his residential intent without going to this zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| We did discuss several alternatives, and he determined that the CG2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| district provided the setbacks and the dimensional standards that he needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| to do what he was trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| What's the maximum R.N. zone in MDRO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| R.N. 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| R.N. 6, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| And within the M.U., the sector plan part of the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5230)|
| 1:27:19| what's the highest R.N. zone within that sector plan designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| Sure. Let me pull that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5245)|
| 1:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5260)|
| 1:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| So, yeah, medium-density residential, office, general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5284)|
| 1:28:13| So general commercial allows for residential development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| That can be more intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Yeah, not R.N. 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| It's not calling for high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5305)|
| 1:28:33| You can't really read that, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5313)|
| 1:28:50| And because of that commercial zoning, that's why he asked for the extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| of the mixed-use district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| Yeah, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| Did you get your answer, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| Mr. Phillips, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| Yeah, this has nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| I was just curious if staff has ever looked at comparing what properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| we've rezoned over the last several years versus what has actually been submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| for concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| Curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| No, we haven't, but that's a good analysis to conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| Yeah, it would be kind of interesting to see how many acres or lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| that potentially could be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| Is it for speculation or is it for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| Well, through our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| Yeah, through the development activity report, you could take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| I mean, we could compare, you know, how many applications you all reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| and then how many plans were approved, how many permits were issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| So, it would be fairly easy for us to connect those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5401)|
| 1:30:10| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| I guess we're dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| I guess we're dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| You'll have Cherry Hill back Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| Thank goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| See you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230606?start=5419)|
