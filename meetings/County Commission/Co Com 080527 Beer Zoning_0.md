| 0:02:13| I live at 752 Old Scribble Pike, Seymour, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=133)|

| 0:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=140)|
| 0:02:28| We're still looking at Mr. Pittner's application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=148)|
| 0:02:37| It does appear that you've got quite a business out at your location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| Are you conducting any form of dancing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| No nude or semi-nude dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| No nude or semi-nude dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| And that you're certainly aware of the nudity ordinance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=171)|
| 0:02:59| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| You went over that with me, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| We're going to need a little bit more time to address Mr. Pittner's beer permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=184)|
| 0:03:12| So we would ask that you defer it for 30 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| I move we defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=198)|

| 0:03:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| John, what's the reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| Trying to determine, actually trying to get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| I think we're going to need more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| And I haven't talked to Mr. Pittner in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| But we have conflicting stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| Mr. Pittner, you may want to call the law department because he's busy too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| so you might want to be a little proactive with it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| If it doesn't seem like, you know, that I need a beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| I can just forget it and not come back and just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| Whether you come back, that's up to you, Mr. Pittner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| But, you know, it's going to take me a little while longer to look over your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| Like I say, we have conflicting information about your arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and we're going to make sure that the information that this board has is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| At the last meeting, you wanted to have a notarized copy of the lease and the sublease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| Would you like to see these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| I'd like to have a copy of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=278)|

| 0:13:41| Let's see what Codes has to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| Applicants applied for a variance tomorrow from the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| Fire marshal, do you have any issues with this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=833)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Next time we're going to have you come up to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Why don't you come up to the mic anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Some of our members can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| We still have an open permit on this project, so our response is pending, passing a final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=856)|
| 0:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| What does that mean, an open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| I don't understand what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| They've applied for a permit through Knox County Codes because it is a new business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| and we've done no inspections out there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| I mean, she was up here last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Why have you guys not had a chance to get out there yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Well, it's not that we haven't had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| It's that they have not called for an inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| When you have a new construction permit, the process is they call in to Knox County Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| They put them on schedule when we come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| It's not like the existing ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| So Codes just hasn't called you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Not Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| The tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| Are they supposed to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| They will have to call and schedule that through Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| That way someone is there when we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Did you know that, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=909)|

| 0:15:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| If you would, get with Ms. Barron's and give her your number so she can call and make arrangements to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| I'll also give her Codes' number, which is where she will have to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Well, she has an application pending before the Board of Zoning Appeals tomorrow, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Commissioner Hammontree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=948)|

| 0:16:23| And I want to call to your attention an ordinance that was passed in 1994 requiring that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| such establishments must be a minimum of 500 feet from any residential or agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=991)|
| 0:16:40| I don't know how the variance process works, but I'm going to vote against this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| because I just do not think that it is in the best interest of the residents in my district that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1007)|
| 0:16:57| Ma'am, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Are yours right there on the very corner of Brickyard and Emory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Didn't they used to sell beer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| They used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| It was a private thing, I think, like a Legion or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| It was an Elks Lodge or an Eagles Club or something for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| And they did have an on-premises permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| But, Commissioner, this is not on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| This is directly across from where Teague Hardware used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| So it's not on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| It's probably halfway between the entrance to the football parking lot at Powell High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| and the intersection of Brickyard and Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| The jewelry store used to be in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| There's been a gift shop and several things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Did you want to make a motion or did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| No, I just wanted to echo Commissioner Roundtree's sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| I'll make a motion that we deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| And the reason would be that it's out of conformity with the zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Ma'am, you're still scheduled for the Board of Zoning Appeals tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| So if you wish to come and see if the Board of Zoning Appeals will grant you a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| then you would need to come back before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| If you were granted the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Next item, Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| This is a deferred application of Sue Morton for Don R. Sports Bar and Grill at 10015 Rutledge Pike, Suite 104,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1119)|
| 0:18:47| on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| Ms. Morton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Hi, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Hi, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Please state your name for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Sue Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Ms. Morton, I need to go through the series of questions, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| You've heard them because you've been sitting here a while and you were here, I believe, last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| Have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Has beer been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| So there's no outstanding license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| This is an application for on-premise consumption, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Who owns the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| John Bates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| So you rent it from Mr. Bates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Is this your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Does anyone else have an interest in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| So you're a sole proprietor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| And you're going to be the person operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| And you're familiar with our beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| and you agree to conduct your conduct in conformity with those beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Have you gone through a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Beer board inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1211)|
| 0:20:19| They're on the board of zoning tomorrow for rezoning, and it does not meet the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| How close are they to a residential zone, I guess it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| I mean, Mr. Law Director, I'd have to go back and check it, but it's within 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Let me go to codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| They're requesting a variance from 500 feet to 137 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Any other codes issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| There you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Mr. Chair, what is it close to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Is it close to the school or I think you said residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| It's a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| It's close to an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| How far down Atlantic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Are you on the Broadway side or are you on Central Avenue side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| The sports bar is on Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| It's not on Atlantic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| That's where you live, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| But I do have notarized statements that it's okay by the people who own the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| and the people who rent the property, the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| Do you have those with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Do you want to pass them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1299)|
| 0:21:47| So is it just one residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| So is it just one residence then that you're close to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1314)|
| 0:22:19| What district is this in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| It would be in the eighth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Can we see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| On that piece of property, it looks like there's either three buildings or are those outbuildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| There's actually just one long building where our place is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| But at the adjoining property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| It looks like there's two houses, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| There may be a garage or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| Okay, let me pass this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Do you guys see a map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1374)|
| 0:23:11| What is this close to on Rutledge Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| It's just past Savannah Transport on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| It's where Mullins Market and Hardware used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| So you're taking over Mullins Market then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Just one section of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| It's a discount store on the end and then John has some antique cards and stuff stored in part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| But you're right there in Mullins, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Where Mullins used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Do I hear a motion from the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| I'll make a motion we approve pending the variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1431)|

| 0:30:53| Well, on a new construction inspection project, what they would do is they would call Knox County Code Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1853)|
| 0:31:00| 215-2325 and schedule an inspection by using their permit number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1860)|

| 0:31:10| On an existing building that does not have an open permit, the process is when it comes up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| for a beer license, we will automatically go out, do an initial inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| and then if there's any violations noted, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| we'll note them on the report and inform them to call us when those are corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| We'll come back out, get them in the green, and they'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| So you're waiting to hear from him for him to call you back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| And that's the same for the other ones, the other Dollar Generals that are on, 98-12, 98-57 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| So were there violations the first time when you went out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Well, I personally didn't go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Chip Widener handles all the existing inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| I know there were violations noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| I'm not sure exactly what they were, but I know they have not been, we've not inspected it since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| So if there's no violations, then you come before this board and say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| So obviously there were some violations noted, and they need to come back out for re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| What's the cycle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| As soon as they know that they have to have a re-inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| how long does it take from when they make the call to somebody coming out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| Something like this, we would rush it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| I mean, as soon as we got the call and we could get out there, we would, usually within, you know, 24, 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Do you tell them when you're out there the first time that they won't be approved until they've been called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| In fact, it's printed on our report that it's their responsibility to call for the re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Mr. Ramtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| This location is also in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| As you see on your notes, it was a food line for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| They had an off-premises permit to sell adult beverages there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| There's been a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Pending the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| We need to do it pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Pending the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Pending the final fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Sometime after the meeting, you need to come and file an amended application, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| And they'll be approving that to get your correct, the owner of the business down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| What the application shows is food line LLC real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| If it's wood or woods property, I think it's wood properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| We have the same owner on the next application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| On the third for Dole Gin, we have White Realty Service Corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| So I don't know if those are accurate or not, but we need to make sure our records are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Mr. Law Director, should we just not defer this then for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| and make sure all the paperwork is accurate and then wait to approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Didn't we do that last time with another applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| It's up to you whether you believe it's necessary to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| I'm just asking Mr. Kelly to make sure that he gets an amended application in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| And, of course, there's still the pending issue of the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| Is it okay if we would defer this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| I just think that we should be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Is there a second to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2069)|

| 0:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2220)|

| 0:37:33| To the best of my knowledge, sir, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| Let me take you through the questions that you've heard a couple of times today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| Have you, sir, or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Beer has not been sold here before, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| So there's no outstanding license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| This is for off-premise sale of beer, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2286)|

| 0:38:38| Is that what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| David Bear, president and interim CEO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2325)|

| 0:40:55| I just didn't hear the fire marshal's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| It was pending like the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2458)|

| 0:42:25| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Next item is consideration of a name change for Booze and Tunes, 5700 Old Rutledge Pike to Pee Wee's Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| Frank Edward Beatty is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| Nettie Beatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| I'm the manager of the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Ms. Beatty, are you related to Frank Edward Beatty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| My son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| That's your son?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| I think our billboard inspector has a statement from Frank Edward Beatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2579)|
| 0:43:09| Can we see that, U.K.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2589)|
| 0:43:24| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2604)|
| 0:43:46| Frank E. Beatty is your son, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Why are you asking for a name change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| We just wanted to change the name over because every time you mention Booze and Tunes to anybody, try to get them to come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| they always say that they've heard that it's a rough place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| Booze and Tunes was the name whenever he bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| He went ahead and left it because he thought with them already being a business there that it probably would help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| And we found out that it's actually hurt because people don't want to come because it had a bad reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| When did your son buy this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| He only has the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| He doesn't own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| When did he buy the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| I believe it was March of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| So he's been operating there since 2005?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2681)|
| 0:44:51| Why didn't he appear before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| He had to work today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| He couldn't take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| He'd been off on leave because his dad is about to pass away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| So he had to work today where he'd been off with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| This is a statement that's signed by Frank Beatty, which says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| I filed an application with the Knox County Beer Board to have the name of my business changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| from Booze and Tunes to Pee Wee's Place to be heard on May 27, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| This will be the only change that will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| The reason for the name change is to try and build up a business that has had a bad name in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| This is a fun bar with no past record of any trouble since I took over in March 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| I would like the name changed on all my business license with the county and state effective on May 27, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| I understand all accounts will retain the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Thank you, Frank Beatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| It's got a signature date of 5-27-08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2748)|
| 0:46:01| Best I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| That was today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| It's not notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| We typically do not accept notarized or unnotarized statements unless they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2769)|
| 0:46:17| He was told and I was told by the library commission that all we needed to do was to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| and have the business license and the sales tax license go ahead and be changed with this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| And that was all we needed to do, but it needed to be done before I appeared here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2790)|
| 0:46:55| Have you all been to the or any of you been to the clerk's office yet to make the changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| Yes, I've already made all the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2823)|
| 0:47:25| Mr. Law Director, I pulled this application in 05 and the new application, and they're absolutely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2845)|
| 0:47:41| Well, you left the drunk driving off of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Because it's past the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| It don't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| It shows on our records when we pull the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| I was told at the time we threw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| I'm not going to argue with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Well, I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I'd make a motion that you deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=2872)|

| 0:55:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| John, is everything that we discussed as far as having that part of the property deeded, deed restricted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| Has that been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| The deed restrictions themselves have not been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| What I am prepared to do is state for the record that that will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| There are three parcels of property involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| The area we're talking about deed restricting actually covers portions of two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| What will happen is after this is rezoned, the property will be re-subdivided all into one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| Then the deed restrictions will be more easily discernible and described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| I'm going to pass to county commission a copy of the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| And on that survey, the area to be deed restricted is shown as storm water management green space area comprising 1.99 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3364)|
| 0:56:14| And it has the description on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| I'm going to make that part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| I have also furnished it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Well, given that fact, I'll make a motion to approve, provided that they follow through with the deed restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3381)|
| 0:56:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| I'll be moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3394)|

| 0:57:09| It's the same motion to approve, given they're going to make that same deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3429)|

| 0:58:16| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Mark, Buzz, can you speak to the slope protection areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| and the development pattern that's associated with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3510)|
| 0:58:30| When you look at your slope protection, actually the plan map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| and you see the slope protection area designated, that was done at a time when we were less precise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3514)|
| 0:58:42| with how we designated the slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| And it serves more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| It still serves as kind of an indicator for us to look for more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| In this case, we did check our slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| And, really, the bottom, the southern, southeastern line of that where he wants the commercial zoning roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3533)|
| 0:59:01| corresponds to where the steep slopes start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| So it really will not impact the slope protection areas we've designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| This we are getting more precise as we show those on our sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| This was more as a general representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| But we checked more detailed information, and we feel comfortable with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| where he's showing that boundary and the fact that it will not disturb if very minimal, if any at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| What is the percent slope that you use as a designation as you're drawing that line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| The steeper parts would be 25 percent or above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| And we also look at, in some cases, it may also look at property that's 15 percent and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| But it's essentially 25 percent and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| Are there any questions, more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| Seeing none, all in favor of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3596)|

| 1:00:18| in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| To the applicant here, is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3620)|

| 1:00:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Commissioner Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| They're rezoning it from a floodway to a residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| Yeah, part of it, a very small part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| I think it's the extreme southeast corner of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| Several years ago, we had a practice of where you had a floodway crossing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| We included, we didn't take it out of the floodway, but we included the base zoning slash floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| It still doesn't impact the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| Nowadays, we tend more to do it just simply, the base zoning and then put the boundary of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| and floodway, but this is left over from years ago when we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| The floodway will not be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| The floodway is being kept in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| You made a motion, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3691)|

| 1:01:51| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| I've been asked to speak on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| I don't truly represent him, but Mr. Darren Mercer, who was here on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| received a message on his cell phone and had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| He asked if I would stand in so this matter wouldn't be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| Let me ask MPC, since maybe John does not know, do they tell you what they want to do with this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| But what in particular does he want to do here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Basically, as we understand, it's any use permitted under the C.A. zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| Looking at the site, you're facing C.A. on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| This would be an extension of C.A. from the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| So we felt like it was more or less filling in a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| But based on the information of the application, it was any use permitted by C.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| Mr. King, did he tell you anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| He did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| He just simply said that basically it was C.A. all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| He was talking about some other C.A. utilization of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| either adjoining his or right in the same general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| And he did not specifically tell me what they proposed to do on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| He did tell me that MPC staff had recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| MPC itself voted for it, 12-0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| I move to approve for MPC staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3811)|

| 1:03:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Mr. Chairman, before the next two are read, I'm John K. King, Ernie P. Obox, 2425,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3817)|
| 1:03:45| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| I represent the applicant on the zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| The next two are for a plan amendment and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| We would ask it be postponed to May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| And I have a gentleman I need to let know that we propose to go forward with it next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| or the month after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| He's entitled to know that in case he wants to voice opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| You mean June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| Until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| I meant to say June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| I'm just wishing for more time, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| We have any opposition to postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| Granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| Is there anything else to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Well, we have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Oh, go back to the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Mr. What's his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| He's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| J.D. Robeson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| J.D. Robeson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| We'll move it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| And we did notify him by an extra letter this month, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| How many times has that been moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| I don't think ever since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| It's been three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| It's been at least three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| I'll make a motion that we withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Properly move that we withdraw to J.D. Robeson for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| We'll be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| There's some people that came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| I didn't know if they thought they might have had some business or maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| We have three items that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| What about the public forum with Chuck Bowers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| We've had public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| No, with Chuck Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Remember I said after zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Well, I thought we had all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| I asked if there was anyone else for public forum before we went on break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| Chuck Bowers is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Yes, he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| We'll go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| I could have got him before break time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| We need MPC to stay just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| They'll be around the corner, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| I could have got you before, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Apology accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Now I know how David must have felt, and I don't even have a slingshot, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| My name is Charles Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| I live at 7920 Blueberry Road in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| I want to thank you very much for this opportunity to talk to you to address an unpopular but unavoidable subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3982)|
| 1:06:32| This is undoubtedly the hardest job I've ever had in my entire life, what I have to do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| I represent a silent but determined majority of ordinary citizens who sincerely want our old Knoxville back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=3997)|
| 1:06:46| a Knoxville where we, rightly or wrongly, trusted our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| Ladies and gentlemen, that trust is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| The media are crowded every day nowadays with complaints, some are warranted, some are not warranted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| about our county government, and particularly, I say this advisedly, about our county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4022)|
| 1:07:11| The media are also crowded with daily snickers at the latest revelation du jour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4031)|
| 1:07:19| That's like soup du jour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Our country has arguably become either a laughing stock or a smiling stock, depending on your point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| to the whole world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| To illustrate, let me reference a couple of recent headlines in our local paper, the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4051)|
| 1:07:39| One, can Ragsdale be effective if the public has lost faith in him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| That's a headline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Two, will embarrassment in the county ever end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| That's a headline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| They were created by respective star-crossed analysts or columnists, Leslie Snow and Greg Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4073)|
| 1:08:02| I'm sure you'll recognize those names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| Their columns illustrated clearly that the dissatisfaction in this county crosses even cultural lines, liberal, conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4086)|
| 1:08:15| The answer to the first question, can Ragsdale be effective, is, in my opinion, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| We believe that the honorable mayor is too besieged and too distracted to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4103)|
| 1:08:32| The answer to the second one about embarrassment is a hopeful maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| Maybe we can shed our shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| For anything to be done, though, first a lot must be undone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| We've concluded, my neighbors and I, some of them are here with me tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| that the only way to get our Knoxville back is to restore accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| and to make corrections from the top to the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| We feel that we, the ever-present Jane and John Does, famous for so many years, are owed that restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4140)|
| 1:09:09| You might ask, why do I think that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| Because theoretically, ladies and gentlemen, we, the citizens, the John Does, the Joe Six-Pack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4152)|
| 1:09:21| occupy the top box in the Knoxville County Government Organization chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| Put another way, and I'm not even going to apologize for this, don't mean it disrespectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| the voter is in reality the chief executive officer of the county, simply stated, your boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4174)|
| 1:09:44| I don't mean that, as I said, disrespectfully, just factually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| For example, in our informal petition drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| I found that no more than 10 percent of those that we talked to displayed any support for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4190)|
| 1:09:59| Most CEOs in the business world will tell you that the hardest thing they ever have to do is to let somebody go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| I've had to do that many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| That's true right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| To let somebody go is one of the hardest, most difficult, most grievous thing anybody will have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| The group of folks with me tonight and who are working with me thought long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| and hard before they prayerfully, prayerfully decided to join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| They represent men and women, young and old, young and not so young, Democrats and Republicans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| Protestants and Catholics, liberals and conservatives, the whole ball of wax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| And crusty old retired nukes like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| Reluctantly, we've all decided, here's the kicker, we've all decided to petition for Mayor Ragsdale's departure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| We can provide many reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Let me highlight just a few, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| If you'll bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| I'm going to reference the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| You have one minute, Mr. Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| I'll quickly finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| The county charter says that, I'll just read the pertinent part, any county official who fails to perform the duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| required under this division or who knowingly, willfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| and intentionally spends or obligates in amounts in excess of the appropriations shall be removed from office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| or terminated for employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| There are more words there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| We submit that even a shallow look at things like the wheel tax, the sheriff's pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| and the P-card situation will unearth multiple triggers for this charter section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| There's a lot of conduct unbecoming of an officer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Let me, I'll just get right to the crux of our petition because I have such little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| Many of my neighbors and myself have signed petitions that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| we have concluded that Mayor Ragsdale is seriously derelict in his duties to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| and we have decided reluctantly to initiate this formal request to the Knox County Commission to force his resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4315)|
| 1:12:04| This is meant as a message to Mayor Ragsdale and also to his successor that the citizen taxpayer will no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4324)|
| 1:12:12| tolerate malfeasance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| We, ladies and gentlemen of the commission, your fellow citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| and the ultimate auditors of the county, respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| and trustingly place the petition and the matter in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| Yes, Mr. Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| I know how hard it is to do a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| I've done one myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Appreciate all the work that you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| But do you understand that this commission doesn't have the power to remove the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| The mayor was elected by the people of Knox County, and we don't have the power to remove him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4371)|
| 1:12:59| In some European countries where they have a parliamentary system, you can have a parliamentary vote of no confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4379)|
| 1:13:07| but we don't have a system like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| One of the only ways that the mayor could be removed from office is for a group of ten citizens to file an ouster suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4390)|
| 1:13:19| like him or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| And sometimes I get along with the mayor, and quite often I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| But like him or not, as a county commissioner, I don't have the power to remove the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| But you, sir, as a citizen, if you want to remove the mayor, you could file an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| But this commission is powerless to do anything in response to your petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| And I just wanted to say that while I appreciate, you know, that you're getting petitions signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| and whenever folks are active in the community, I love to see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| but I just wanted to be sure that you understood that no matter how many signatures you get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| we simply do not have the power to act on that petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| How do you think you're here, Mr. Howard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| How do you think you're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Nobody forced you to sit in that seat, and that goes for all of you, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| You need a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| My name is Patty Walker, and I live at 3037 Tipton Station Road in Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4454)|
| 1:14:22| My phone number is 3100359.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| But I would like to say to you, you know, give me a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| I'm a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| You say you don't have the power to do this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Why do you think you're up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Nobody forced you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| None of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| You went to the people and you said, trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| Please vote for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| I want to represent you in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| I want to do the right thing for Knox County, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| And the people did as you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| They trusted you, and they voted for you for an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| And any time, any time that you can't stand the heat, I'm talking especially to you, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| I heard you talk about the hours last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| I spent a number of hours here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| But, listen, again, you weren't forced into this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| And any time you don't like the hours or you're not up to the job, listen, all you have to do is resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| And I guarantee you there's many people in the sidelines who would love to do the right thing to step up and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4517)|
| 1:15:25| Ma'am, it's just simply that, and, yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| I knocked on a lot of doors and asked for this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| And I'm very proud to serve in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| And there is certain authority that we have granted to us by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| But, unfortunately, removing another office holder like the county mayor is not one of those powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| But you have that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| If you wanted to file an ouster suit, you have the power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| You, as a taxpayer, are our bosses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| You could file an ouster suit to ouster any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Mr. Law Director, am I explaining this correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| And may I answer your question you ask of me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| I wanted a chance for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| John, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| The commission doesn't have the power to remove the mayor from office under the current law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| There is a provision that's going to be on the ballot in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4579)|
| 1:16:26| First of all, ten commissioners could get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| Ten citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| Ten citizens could file an ouster suit if it's justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| There has to be substantial evidence of wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| But Mr. Payone and others were instrumental in a recall amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| drafting in our office assisted in that, and that's going to be on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| which would be a method to recall an elected official of Knox County that we currently don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| You have the recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| We have a recall provision with the city offices, but you don't have with county offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| So that will be on the ballot August 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| And I just wanted to say that recall amendment, while it's not effective now, was a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| Mr. Payone brought it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| And I think Mark Harmon, you couldn't get more bipartisan support than that, co-sponsored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| But it's just not in effect at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| I would like to say something to Mr. Briggs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| He was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| I don't know who Don Bosch is, but Don Bosch asked him on TV yesterday if he thought the mayor expected the censor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4652)|
| 1:17:42| And he said, no, he didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| But guess what, folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| I was walking out of the building in front, about two or three steps in front of Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| He's not my mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| I want to call him Mr. Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| I was about two steps in front of him, and there was a reporter who actually gave a little laugh before he said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| I don't know where he was from, but he says to Mr. Ragsdale, did anything happen in there that you did not expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4683)|
| 1:18:11| And Mr. Ragsdale said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| It went just like he thought it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| And I stopped immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Bea Waters and I were walking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| I stopped immediately, and I stood toe-to-toe with him, nose-to-nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| And I said, Mr. Ragsdale, if I reach inside your pocket and I take your wallet, take everything out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4705)|
| 1:18:33| and, of course, you're going to know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| So you're going to catch me at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| And I'm going to say, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| I'm sorry you caught me stealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Just call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| It's stealing what the man has done and continues to do, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| And he's getting away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| But I said to him, if you caught me, could I just say to you, gee whiz, I'm sorry, I made a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| And I think Mr. Briggs said that yesterday, and I wanted to sort of ‑‑honestly, I wanted to upchuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| It just ‑‑it was sickening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| He said, the man had apologized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| The man has said he made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| And I said, well, duh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| And I asked him, would you have J.J. Jones serving me breakfast in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| or would you just take your empty wallet and walk away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| The mayor did not have a single word to say to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| He took me by the arm and wanted me to walk out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| And I continued walking with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| And I said, if you could have only been ‑‑I was sitting over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| I said, if you could only have been sitting where I was sitting and saw your little snake pit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| and the little grins and the winks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| And I mean, I heard Mike Hammond more than once talk about, what's his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4782)|
| 1:19:50| Armstrong chomping at the bits to get in on this love thing or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| I mean, it was truly a big joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| And to see a bigger circus, you'd have to buy a ticket to Ringling Brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| And I guarantee you, Mr. Strickland, I'm sorry, you said when he'll ask you on the radio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4801)|
| 1:20:10| in response to the last caller, which was myself, you said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| But I obviously wanted the mayor's resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| And there was a small number of people like me out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| Well, guess what, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| You need to take your head out of the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| It's not a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| There's people right here what few people here have asked to sign the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| And we did this in two days' time with only three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| We did it over Memorial Day weekend while you were picnicking or at the lake or whatever you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| I was on dialysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Well, you were doing your dialysis, Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| I was on my dialysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| I was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| I wasn't at the picnic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Yeah, I was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| You got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| I was out there getting signatures, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| And they're right here on a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| And I'm wearing black for a very good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| I'm in mourning for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| And with the exception of Victoria DeVries and Paul Pinkston, I am ashamed of each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| And if you think for one minute that there's not a large bunch of citizens out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| taxpayers that feel the same way, try running for another office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| Or if you're not term limited, try running again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| They'll speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| They'll let you know what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| They feel the same way I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Thank you, Ms. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| We have three discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| We have three discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| Mr. Chairman, I just have an agenda question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| Maybe I just lost track of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| But what happened to Commissioner DeVries' motion to sever a library from PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| Because Commissioner DeVries, what happened there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| I believe it was deferred until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| It's deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| And I met with John Troyer and also the president of the library board, Frank Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4908)|
| 1:21:56| And I've also been just speaking with different people on the advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| They were here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| They're not here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| But I believe that they will probably speak to this next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| It will be on next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| My apologies for not keeping track of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| Thank you for paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| You usually do a little better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| Becky didn't make any food this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| Well, actually, she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| But we're going to try to get out of here on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| You ate all the cookies yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| Go ahead and tell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| We have three discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| If you remember, the intergovernmental finance, I said we needed to get another date for the grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4948)|
| 1:22:36| And I know each and every one of you have looked at your calendars to get a good date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| Jody had told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| You name it, I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| Well, we're going to be here on the second for the different department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| Just about every date is open, either here or in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4975)|
| 1:23:06| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| I'm in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| On the second, are you in, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| On the second, how long were you anticipating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Is that an all-day meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| Well, it's going to be at least four or five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| What I would like to do, Jody and I have put together a little time schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| and I think we probably need to see about how long we're going to probably interview each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| ask questions to each individual department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| Last time I think we did ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| We probably need to do a little bit more this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| Some will be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| Some will be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| But I'd like to give them at least a timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| They probably need to be here within an hour anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| You'll see probably 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| What time would you like to be over with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| We said we'll start at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| So probably have an hour and a half, an hour for lunch, and then probably start back in the end about 2 or 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5043)|
| 1:24:11| I think the law director and myself, we have a meeting at 3, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| On the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| We can be through by 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| Do you want me to make a schedule where we can be through by 2.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| Or sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| Or sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| What do you say, 15 minutes for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| How many do we know how many we would be asking to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| I have county clerk, juvenile judge, Tim Erwin, law director, registered deeds, property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5078)|
| 1:24:45| health department, trustee, public building authority, community development, engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| finance, health department, human resources, library, office of neighborhoods, parks and recreation, probation, pretrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5090)|
| 1:24:58| purchasing schools, and the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| We need the schools, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| I think that almost should be a day to itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| Well, we've had time with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| We know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| And they can always come to our committee meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| There's some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| And probably we're going to have to have another one to wrap it all up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| So if we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Chairman, there's several of us commissioners that have a meeting with the school board tomorrow at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| Well, that's what we, a lot of us already had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| So that's what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| The rest of us that didn't get that, we'll get it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| I can lead the schools out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| And so we have one, two, three, four, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| We'll go into that tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| And on this schedule that I have, it's ten minutes apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| We got out in three hours and ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| So I'll do the schedule and I'll send it out tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5152)|
| 1:25:59| So it won't be over 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| Mr. Chairman, what about meeting on June 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| It's Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Friday is June the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| One of those two days to go over community grants and anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| Community grants is probably going to take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| I would have conflicts with both those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| With the 5th and the 6th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Well, every Tuesday and Thursday is bad for me, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| But Vice Chairman Hammer can take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| Excuse me, Mr. Strickland, I have one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| What about the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| Victoria, I'm going to be out of town the 11th through the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| I think it's going to be impossible to accommodate everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| I think you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| What we have is we're going to have to have another one after this, I'm pretty sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| So when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5216)|
| 1:27:06| You said June the 7th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| That's on a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Let's see how we end up on the 2nd and see what all we still have to do and then let's say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| Well, this grant is a totally different process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| What about Monday, June the 9th, Tuesday, June the 10th, anything that week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5239)|

| 1:27:26| I'm bad on the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| The 10th works, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| I am in the mornings from 9 until about 1230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| I'm available from 1 o'clock after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| We need to start early in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| How about June 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5261)|

| 1:28:08| I moved a dental appointment from the 2nd to 4th to accommodate our first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| Let's just meet on June 2nd and then we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5296)|

| 1:28:37| By how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| You can't be there on the 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| I'll be late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| What about the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| Fine with the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| The 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| We're going to start at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| I can't call you to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Yeah, you can call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| We're going to do it on the 8th at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| I mean the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| Wednesday the 11th at 830 for the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| You want to have the process of just having it in the paper and letting people call in for times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| time slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Yeah, they can just call into the commission office and schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| Rebecca?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| The 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| We're going to meet at 830 on the 2nd and 830 on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5378)|
| 1:29:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| I'll just take a few seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| I forgot one very, very important point a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| My cameraman mentioned at the last meeting that I was at here that since we were asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5396)|
| 1:30:04| or I forget exactly what his words were verbatim, but since we're asking for resignations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5404)|
| 1:30:11| maybe there's a few more up here that should resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| Be careful what you ask for, and I think you're right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| That's the one thing I can honestly say that you've done that's constructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| We're not going to have personal attacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| That's not a personal attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| In my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| No, that's a personal attack on his character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Well, I think he did a personal attack on Victoria's character when he said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| Well, I didn't catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Oh, you're sitting right beside him and you didn't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| I didn't catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| I'm sure you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| But I caught you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| I'm sure you didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| Commissioner Davis, your next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| You're scolding people and it made me nervous there for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| No, what I was interested in discussing was and Jolie had put together and passed this around with regard to civil service merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5454)|
| 1:31:02| rules and regulations that I was afforded to by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| And I'm interested in Knox County employees having the same protection as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| And I had asked Mr. Owings to kind of look at Shelby County and their civil service policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| and see if we can institute similar here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| The other discussion item I had was an ordinance with regard to the fee offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| and their budgets coming under the purview of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| And that hopefully we can get both those things put on as ordinance for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| We need a few more things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| We can handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| You're really bored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| And so I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| Commissioner Davis, I'm not against any of the things that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| But I think that since it directly impacts the fee offices, we need to set up a means whereby they can weigh in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| let us know their feelings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| No, I completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| And that was one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| I'm glad you brought that up, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| When I was e-mailing this information to Mr. Owings and then also to Jolie and to get these things together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| I became aware of the fact that apparently my e-mail is not going through to the recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| And I also became aware of the fact that constituents that are e-mailing me, I'm not receiving their e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| And this is a real concern for me because I don't think that I can be effective as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| if I can't get work product to the law director and to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| And then also if I have constituents who are e-mailing me about concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| and I'm unaware of those concerns, they're just viewing me as being unresponsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| Because I did some tests where I e-mailed myself from my personal e-mail to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| It sent a message on my personal account that the message had been sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| but when I checked my Knox County account, it never appeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| Also, I had some of my relatives e-mail me from various areas of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| and from different e-mail accounts such as Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MSN, Web TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| And all of them received a message saying that their message was sent, but I never received a message from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5591)|
| 1:33:19| And I've talked to IT and I don't know if Dick's still here or John Gustin is still here, but that's a real concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5599)|
| 1:33:27| He had said that apparently they're being attacked and they're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| But I don't know if any other commissioners may want to check with some of their constituents to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| if they're not receiving these e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| I wasn't aware that I wasn't receiving these e-mails until I had people calling me saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| I sent you this a week ago, a month ago, and you haven't responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| And I said, well, I've never received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| So you other commissioners may need to check yours as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| So that's where I apologize with regard to the fee officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| I've tried to get a hold of them as well because I wanted them to weigh in, but obviously they didn't receive my e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| And I wasn't aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| So, but, yes, I agree, all the stakeholders need to be brought into the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| I did speak to HR, Ms. Fogerson, and we definitely need to make sure that everyone is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| Yes, I still haven't received your e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| Have you checked with John Colston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| And that's a real concern for me that I've e-mailed, you know, Mr. Owings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| He usually comes out to my house when I have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| Tell him to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| Oh, well, I mean, this has been about the third or fourth time that I've contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| And John this morning was telling me that apparently there's some things that they're looking into that they're being attacked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| and I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Well, I'm actually experiencing that same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| For the record, I'm not able to send and receive e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| They go through, but it doesn't reach the intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| With some providers, you can't get out over, like, ten megabytes of attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| Mine is that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| So from home, I can't hardly send you an attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| But I would think that it would send a message back, mail ordainment or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| that the file was too big or there would be some sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| It wouldn't say that the item has been sent or my message has been sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| There would be some sort of reply back stating that, you know, either it was busy or, you know, there would be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| And it's always been this message has been sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| So either it's being diverted to someone else, someone else is receiving it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| or it's just going into a black hole somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| I'll check with IA tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| Mr. McKenzie, you having the same problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| All of us are then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| Yeah, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| I'm trying to send either a reply, and I just can't reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| I'll check with them tomorrow and tell them that everyone's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Mark, are you having those problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| No, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| That's Mark too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| I've not noticed any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| Maybe that I work Mac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Is that what you're thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| I'm not having any problems either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| So you're saying I should have got a Mac is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| Should have got a Mac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| Once you go Mac, you don't go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5773)|

| 1:36:26| And so I just wanted you to know that we're thinking alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| And Mr. Law Director, would you like to share what you shared with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| Could you please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5797)|

| 1:36:40| Shelby County has civil service for some of its employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| And, of course, the city of Knoxville does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| So we're going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| We're going to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| It's going to take us 10 or 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| But hopefully we'll have something to present to you at the committee meetings this next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| I also have problems with my computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| But somebody looked at it and it was a Microsoft Outlook issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| And because I had IT out to my house, like, almost like three days in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| And I spent many, many, many, many hours at home with IT at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| And someone else was able to just fix it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| So it can't be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527beerzoning?start=5838)|
