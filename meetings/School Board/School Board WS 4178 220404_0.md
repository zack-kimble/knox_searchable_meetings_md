| 0:01:43| in executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Mr. Dupler, could you please share information with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| regarding executive session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| So like you said, the board met with our office for our attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| to be able to discuss pending and potential litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| that went as it usually does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| There was no deliberation and none was allowed by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| Any questions were directed toward myself or our representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| and this was all done pursuant to an exception to the Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| found that Smith County Education Association versus Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=151)|

| 0:02:39| We also have a called meeting scheduled for Wednesday, April 27th at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| regarding the fiscal year 2023 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| The location of that meeting will be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| and announced closer to the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| The board student representative application window closed on March 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| 21 applications from students at 11 different high schools were received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| The selection committee will begin convening over the next two to three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| with both Ms. Horn and Mr. Chin serving on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| I know they look forward to introducing our new student rep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| for the 2022-2023 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| Board members, I just wanted to note that Item 5 on tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| which was an update on the Advanced Knox Comprehensive Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| has been withdrawn at the request of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| They needed just a little more time to review all of the input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| that has been received from stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| and look forward to sharing more information with us in early May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| Also, in regards to the superintendent contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| we do have a slight change in that if Mr. DuPort wants to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| Yes, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| This peppermint is rolling around, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| But on paragraph 4, or Section 4 of the superintendent's contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| and I've already spoken to Dr. Reiswick and Madam Chair about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| one sentence was changed in that due to a concern raised today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| and that change was from language that said that the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| and the board chair would agree upon performance objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| It's now being changed to such objectives shall be jointly proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| by the director and board chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| and must be approved by the entire board before utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| And, frankly, that was the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| but the language was lifted from another document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=277)|
| 0:04:45| so it wasn't translated correctly, obviously, but that's been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| Obviously, the board would have to agree on any type of evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| which is in there or performance objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you, Mr. DuPort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| So do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| So a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=314)|

| 0:05:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| And I will turn it over to you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| I'd like to begin by highlighting an important event that took place last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| On March 26th, KCS hosted a recruitment fair at Central High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| which gave our school leaders a chance to visit with job applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| for a wide variety of positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| I would like to thank Scott Bolton and our human resources team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| and our school administrators, central office administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| for their work on this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| And then also thank everyone who attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| We're still seeking community-minded applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| to fill a number of positions within our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=350)|

| 0:06:23| and very rewarding to work with our school staff and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| I'm also pleased to announce some new features on the KCS website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| that will make it easier for students and families to receive updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| find information, and learn about their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| Earlier this month, translate buttons in Spanish, Arabic, Chinese,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| and Swahili were added in the upper left-hand corner of www.knoxschools.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| as well as on school websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| In addition, KCS recently launched www.knoxschools.org.espanol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| a condensed Spanish language version of the district website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| that highlights areas of high importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| It is essential that families have access to important information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| about their child's education, even if they're still learning English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| and I'm grateful that we can implement these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Finally, I want to remind everyone that our schools will be closed on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=430)|

| 0:07:40| Thank you to Ms. Horn for requesting this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| and I would love to welcome Ms. Lowe from Dogwood Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| with a couple of her ambassadors, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=468)|
| 0:08:02| Okay, so Mr. Silas is bringing around our Ambassador Program Handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| We'll be referencing that a few times throughout the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| I'm Hannah Rudder, and this is Sarah DeLapp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| and we are the Ambassador Coordinators at Dogwood Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| and we are here today with Silas, one of our Great Shake winners from this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| just to tell you a little bit more about our Ambassador Program and our Great Shake event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| So first off, our Ambassador Program is a program that we started in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| and our 4th and 5th grade students go through a selection process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| where they have to fill out an application similar to a job application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| They have to get teacher recommendations filled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| and then they go through an in-person interview in order to be selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| After we select, we select 30 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=530)|

| 0:09:10| where they get to participate in real-world situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| to put those communication and leadership skills to the test and practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| They also receive feedback at that point as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Our student Ambassadors are also trained to be leaders in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| They greet guests at the front of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| They provide school tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Overall, they're just positive role models for the rest of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| These are our core values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| This is what our program is really driven by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| We believe that these characteristics are characteristics of successful individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| Confidence, poise under pressure, charisma, personality, communication skills, and having fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| We really like to instill those in our student Ambassadors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Now, Sarah is going to talk to you about our Great Shake event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| Hi, thanks again for having us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| We're super excited to share this information with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| The purpose of our program can be found on page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| I'll give you just a second to look over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=615)|
| 0:10:25| We really want to highlight the last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| At the end of the contest, being the Great Shake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| the school aims to prepare their students to present themselves exceptionally well for opportunities today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| as well as those that will come in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| That's kind of what we pride ourselves on with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| These are not skills that they're learning for the day, or the week, or the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| but these are things that will help them in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| We've actually seen success of that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Our 5th graders recently visited South Jewel Middle School, which is our feeder middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| and 5 of the 10 tour guides were former Ambassadors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| and we're constantly getting compliments on those students as they have moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| Just a little bit of background for the Great Shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| Our first competition was held in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| It was in our gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| We lined up our Ambassadors in the gym, and we had staff as judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| and they literally walked down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| They shook everyone's hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| They had about a minute to introduce themselves and carry on a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| We rang a bell. They rotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| That was year 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Now, fast forward to 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| We have over 40 judges from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| No staff is involved, so it's a very impartial group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| Many of those judges return year after year because they're very impressed by the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| and now we do those in classrooms with complete room transformations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| so it's a pretty big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| It's pretty fancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| There are two parts to the competition for Round 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| The first part is called the Circle of Doom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| The second part is called the Gauntlet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| and we will tell you more information about that shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Before we get started, we have a little hype video that we had made for our kids this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| we thought we would share with you guys, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| How do I make it play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| Are you doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| Oh, okay. That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| We'll move on, and we will let Silas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| If you want to look over page 5 in your handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| we are going to let Silas share some information about the Gauntlet and the Circle of Doom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=768)|
| 0:12:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| My name is Silas Notas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| You might be recognized by a couple seconds ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| She just said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| I'm going to be telling you more details about the Great Shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| So about the Gauntlet, there was 10 challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| All the challenges were amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| In that picture above the challenges, there is me eating on a cookie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| I think we need to up our cookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Those work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| 30 judges from our community and a bunch of real-world scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| My personal favorite had to be the angry customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=812)|
| 0:13:43| The angry customer kept like, oh, how long is this going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| Oh, that's too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| But if you keep your cool under pressure, overall, he was a really nice guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| He was just acting like a mean person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| But, yeah, those had to be my favorite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Now moving on to the Circle of Doom, there's 20 judges, one minute to introduce yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| and there's many questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| My favorite question had to be if you could meet any celebrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| I personally had a very hard time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| I play soccer, so I had to go with soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| So I said my favorite soccer player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Lionel Messi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| And the person I said that to thought it was really interesting that I like soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| I explained why I liked it, and I had a lot of fun introducing why I like soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=873)|
| 0:14:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| My co-partner isn't here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| He had a bit of an incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| But I'll be telling you about these pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| So the first picture, those were the top fives of the Great Shake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| and it was Fiona Garner, Myles Bailey, my name, Cash, and Jarrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=902)|
| 0:15:12| And then we moved on to the second round, which was the panel discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| It was kind of like this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| It was we sat down, they asked us questions, and we had a lot of fun at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| We had a lot of fun questions, like we should spread the ambassadors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| to different grades and different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Wink, wink, wiggity, wink, wink, wink, wink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| And the final round was dinner with Dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| We had to make a speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Me and Cash spent many days on that speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| and we discussed why we think we should get a raise for our playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| And personally, my favorite part of that script was we added a rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| We literally hit rock bottom, which was mostly why I enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| It made a lot of people laugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| It was just overall a really great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| And this is the National Racing Shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| I just need a minute to take this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| So the first picture up there is RCA Gate, Ronkark Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| one of the biggest and best schools here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| It's just an amazing place once you go inside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| It's like the real Hogwarts in real life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| And then the second picture is we got our pictures taken for leaderboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| and you can see my partner Cash is up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| He's getting his picture taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Then we move on to the third picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| This is my favorite picture because you got to party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| We had a RCA student who was a really nice guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| His name was Miguel, and me and Cash got tips from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| and he was just overall really nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| I used those tips, and I got a really good score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Moving on to the next pair of pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| What is that one again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| I know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| So it is the judge challenge in the gauntlet at the Amazing Shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| At the judge challenge, you had to make sure to stay cool under pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| because the judge was accusing you of stealing a button stealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| Very random, but I respected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| And we did that, and then I did it completely wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| I thought you were supposed to plead your case, but not apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Moving on to the second picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| So you had to explain cryptocurrency to people who were acting old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| I couldn't hear that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| I don't know if they were really old, but you had to tell them about cryptocurrency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| which was really hard to do because they were like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| But I explained, and I got a pretty good score on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| And then the final picture, I think it was the Tonight Talk Show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| I think I said that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| But we got interviewed by a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| and they asked us questions about current events such as Ukraine and Russia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| And we answered that, and it was like the real experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| except with a different host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| So to kind of sum up what Silas said, we had the Great Shake here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| and the top two, which were Silas and Cash, were sent to Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| to Ron Clark Academy to compete in the National Amazing Shake with students from all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| So it was a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| We learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| On the screen and also in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| we've listed a lot of the organizations and companies that have been involved as judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| We pride ourselves on this because without these people, we could not have this competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| and they have been very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| And Mr. Thomas, I don't know if you remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| but you were actually a judge in one of our very first Great Shake competitions way back in like 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| So we started smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| We used a lot of central office staff, and then we've expanded out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| And to wrap up today, we're just going to share some of our goals for the future of our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1192)|
| 0:20:03| So one of our first goals is to partner with other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| So we would really like to see this program and the Great Shake expand to other schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| because we've seen the success in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| And Sarah and I would love the opportunity to go and share our ideas and the success we've had here at Dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1216)|
| 0:20:25| And we also would love to see it be used in the feeder schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| So we've seen the success that we've had with our fourth and fifth graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| but we would like to see that continue with the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Did you want to add on to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| I was just going to say our fifth graders get really sad when they leave to go to middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| and there's no more ambassadors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| They have SGA, but it's a little bit of a different focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| So our own kids have been pleading with us to try to get it to extend into the middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| and I think South Doyle is trying to work some things out for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| So that would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| The next one, the funding and sponsorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| That is, currently we operate on about a $1,200 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| and that comes from donations, personal donations from people that we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| Our PTO will usually throw some money in there, and that goes to fund our current Great Shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| If we expand, we would have to increase our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| So one of our goals is to find additional funding and sponsorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| And, yes, we would love to make Dogwood a host for a district-wide competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| Again, we've seen the success that this program can have, and we would love to see it go district-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| So we would love for Dogwood to be kind of the hub for a district-wide Great Shake competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| And then our ultimate goal is to become a leadership school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| We've been doing this with fourth and fifth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| This year, or next year, we're planning to expand to junior ambassadors with third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| But we've also started kind of playing around with expanding it to our entire school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| We started, I guess, two weeks ago working on just handshakes and introductions pre-K through fifth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| and we're planning on having our first school-wide shakeoff in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| So we're hoping that these skills will start trickling down because it's made a huge difference in just behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1349)|
| 0:22:37| responsibility, poise under pressure, things like that that are helpful in all areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1357)|
| 0:22:47| All right. Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you so much for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| When I saw the Great Shake in the newsletter that the district puts out a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| I emailed Hannah right away because I found out about the Great Shake, I think it was probably in November 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| I'm not sure exactly when, but at a TSBA convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| And so when I saw it, I was like, this is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| I love this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| But it's the kind of thing that you really have to have educators who are passionate about it who will spread it to everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| And we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| So I am thrilled that you are passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| And so I 100% support your efforts to do all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| And thank you so much for just bringing attention to it so the right people are in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| so they can help you spread this message out to other educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| And, you know, I think that as board members, we hear often from the community partners how soft skills are such an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1427)|
| 0:23:57| And we all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| And so to me, the earlier you start with this type of program, the better, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| So I love that you're that you're going to add third grade next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| And I think it's a great idea to continue into middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| I know it reminds me a little bit of the DECA program that the high schools have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| So, you know, you can kind of feed right into into the work that a lot of those business teachers are already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| So let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| So if you were would you have if additional schools come on board, would they have their own great shake at their school and then send their winners to a district level competition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1467)|
| 0:24:42| That is a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| So, yes, that is the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| We would love for schools that would like to participate to have their own great shake within their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| And then their top five finalists could come and compete at Dogwood for the district wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| And then the winners from the district wide would then be sent to the National Amazing Shake in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| And I'm assuming you could also say the twelve hundred dollar budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Is that to do what you need to do for that competition that day or the or the whole program, including the competition, but maybe not including the national?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1506)|
| 0:25:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| It's it's for the great shake event and the entire program, but not including the cost of the national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| So is twelve hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Would that be roughly what a school would need to the kind of budget they would need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| Or can you talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| Well, we we started with a budget of zero in our school gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| So this program is easily it's easily you can start it without a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| But we our vision has grown as we've seen the success of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| And so and as we have more volunteers from the community come in, they want to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| And one way to get involved is to donate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| OK, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you so much for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| I appreciate you being here and sharing that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Silas first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Thanks for coming out and representing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| You represented very well, which you should because the nature of the work you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| It's like so you showed your stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| And I think we're really talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| So there's the great shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| But then there's the ambassador program that undergirds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| So if a school just wanted to do like the great shake event, they really would need to start an ambassador program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| To be effective at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| I mean, to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| I think that the ambassador program allows us to do the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Like the modeling and the lessons and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Do you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Do you want to talk about how it prepared for you to go to nationals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| The Dogwood great shake prepared me to go to the nationals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| It was like a minimized version of the amazing shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| There was still like they both teach real world scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| But the Dogwood great shake at Dogwood taught us about – me and Cash got told about the amazing shake and stuff that helped us prepare for eventually becoming a great shake competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1627)|
| 0:27:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| And is the – sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| I'll just give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| So one after school class may be about angry customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| So we set up simulations of different times that you would be in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| How would you deal with it, model it, and then that would be a booth or a challenge in our great shake and then move on to the amazing shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| A lot of times there is something similar in the nationals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Yeah, and the great shake seems to be a model, but is the ambassador program that you all implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| Did you all design that or are you taking that from somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| No, we created that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Okay, so I think –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| I think we got the inspiration when we visited Ron Clark Academy because all of their students are very proficient in these skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| That is a part of their culture, hardcore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| But then we brought it back and figured out how can we start creating that at Dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| And that's something that when you all talked about being a leadership school, you all are willing to help others figure out how to do not just the great shake but the ambassadorship portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1697)|
| 0:28:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Is the $1,200 budget, is that just for the great shake event or does that help fund your whole ambassador program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| Just the great shake event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| We really don't use any funding for the ambassador program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| You just use a lot of staff time, which is worth a lot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| We have done the jackets and things like that that have been donated, the swag, because that helps us feel more confident in our presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1723)|
| 0:28:55| But other than that, it's just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| And the curriculum that we have designed is totally based off the ELA standards in the curriculum guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| And that's something that we would love to share with other schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| Why reinvent the wheel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| We're happy to share our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1753)|

| 0:29:16| And just really quick, this is Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| He was – sorry that he's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| He was in a little fender bender before they came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| But it was that important to him to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| So he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| So he was another one of our top finalists in our great shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Yeah, thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Ms. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Oh, I don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| I just wanted to thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Thank you for sharing your experience and sharing the ambassador program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| I love this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| So thank you for leading these students and doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| And I'll definitely be in touch with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| I've already texted with some principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| I'm like, this is so cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| So I'll definitely be in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| And maybe we can spread it around the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Because I just love things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| And thank you for giving your time to this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| And in your handbook, both of our emails are under the table of contents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| I saw it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| I'm like, oh, there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| And I also will be contacting you all to be judges next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| We've got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Mr. Chin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Once again, thank you all for coming out and talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| I think this sounds like a really great opportunity for our younger students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| And I would really like to see this possibly implemented in other schools in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| And, of course, Silas, you did a great job speaking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| So I hope you go on and do great things in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| And just keep on going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| You're doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| And thank you for all the time and energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| It was fun watching you all on Facebook when you were at the Ron Clark Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| And Cash and Silas, are they both in fifth grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Okay, so we will get Mr. Norris over to Dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| So practice your presentation, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| And I will bring him over to Dogwood, and you can pitch it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1864)|
| 0:31:22| Okay, so moving on, Superintendent Thomas, do we have a playground update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| I guess it was last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Mr. Watson, I think we talked last week, I believe, about the playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| and what, after Commissioner Jay made his presentation to the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| then we as a staff had talked about a few things, looking at a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| And we thought that the best course of action would be as a next step is to develop program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| We have program standards for all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| So in terms of making an assessment of those playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| to get those standards established would be the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| And I think, Russ, if it's okay, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| I was going to ask Mr. Oaks if he could talk a little bit more about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Last week, Superintendent asked us to go ahead and develop some program standards for playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| Program standards drive all of the construction work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| So today we had our first gathering between the facility staff and the curriculum and instruction staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| to talk about what we think those program standards look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| and how we want to go about developing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| And our playgrounds should help develop skill sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| and how we want to use those playgrounds to develop basic cognitive, physical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| and social-emotional skill sets and the type of activities that would take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| in order to drive what that goal would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| So curriculum and instruction has gone back to develop some vision for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| and what they want to use the playgrounds to do in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| And then the facility staff has gone back to look specifically at the size of the playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| and how many students should accommodate, age ranges, types of equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| code-specific code requirements that may come into play, as well as ADA access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| And we'll come back together in a couple of weeks and see if we can put everybody's notes together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| and start developing a standard that we can bring to the board for the board's adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2015)|
| 0:33:43| Once that is complete, then we will go back and assess all of our playgrounds against that standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| to determine which ones meet it and which ones we need to do some work on on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2029)|
| 0:33:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Superintendent and Russ, thank you all for taking a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| and considering playground standards and also doing the assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Something else that I think would need to be happening if the board decided they wanted to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| and pursue some possible action around this is also how it might be funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| both in the short term and the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| So, Superintendent, is Ron and Mr. McPherson in the budget office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| looking at some possible scenarios and ways to get at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| We appreciate you all and the work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| We're looking forward to seeing what you come back with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2076)|
| 0:34:47| And now we have an ESSER Priority 4 report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| Is that you, Dr. Ryslick, or Dr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2090)|
| 0:35:01| Check, one, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| All right, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| All right, good afternoon, Madam Chair, Madam Vice Chair, Board Members, and Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| Thank you guys for allowing us to present our ESSER 3 Priority 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| Overcoming Obstacles to Learning presentation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| This priority is led by Mr. Jason Myers, our Executive Director of Student Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| but Mr. Myers is not present today with us due to a pre-scheduled out-of-town school site learning visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| so I just want to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| And also, he, of course, has been leading the implementation and planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| with this team of strategy owners, and they are here with me today to help with the sharing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| and reporting out of each of the strategies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| And also, Mr. Myers wanted me to share, quote here, that he is, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| available via e-mail to discuss any follow-up questions or clarifying questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| or suggestions you may have following this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| Okay, so here is our vision for ESSER that we present at every board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Our vision is to use the funds strategically so that all students across all schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| and all student groups have the access and supports needed to make sure that they're thriving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| in grade level and also post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| Okay, you guys have seen this slide as well, but all of our strategies that we've shared with you thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| and the ones that you'll hear about today are focused on, A, accelerating the work needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| to meet the needs of our students, staff, and families negatively impacted over the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| and B, sustaining this work to support our district with making sure our students are truly thriving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| in grade level and post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| Okay, this slide details our four priorities, our ESSER priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| We have, one, foundational academic skills, two, effective educators, three, post-high school readiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| four, overcoming obstacles to learning, which we'll be hearing about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| And this slide shows you our reporting schedule to you guys and to the community of stakeholders as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| We started with February, obviously, with priority three, post-high school readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| Last month, we shared out with priority one with Ms. Shannon Jackson, foundational academic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| And up today, we will be sharing with priority 14, overcoming obstacles to learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| And then next month, we have priority two, effective educators with Mr. Scott Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| And then we'll start cycle two, if you will, in June, and we'll be sharing out the next four updates with that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| Okay, so here you have priority four flowchart, overcoming obstacles to learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| But I have a few points here just to share the rationale behind this priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| because it's a lot of moving parts to make sure we're meeting the needs of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| So as you know, COVID-19 dramatically and negatively impacted learning over the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Our students experienced several obstacles and barriers to learning during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| Priority four, overcoming obstacles to learning, focuses on identifying and implementing evidence-based strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| designed to help us quickly close academic gaps and remove barriers to learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| while at the same time creating safe and healthy learning environments through facilities and technology improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| So why priority four? Well, our students witnessed increased mental health needs due to increased social isolation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| general anxiety, and also anxiety about academic loss and disrupted routines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| Also, behavioral health needs increased from a lack of immediate access to our students during the crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| And several schools experienced the impact of student deaths due to community violence and subsequent student responses in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| There was also a decreased ability to fully identify students' needs and develop effective plans during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| And limited time in school included reduced behavioral learning opportunities for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| Consequently, behavioral challenges were seen when virtual students returned to in-person instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| Regarding chronic absenteeism, as a school district, we have a 16% chronic absenteeism rate for 2020-2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2321)|
| 0:38:49| And a majority of chronically absent students from the 19-20 school year participated in virtual learning at least part of the 2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2329)|
| 0:38:57| And also, while all grade bands have consistently received consistent and reliable access to devices and classroom technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| these devices will need to be replaced at regular intervals to address any out-of-warranty failures, non-repairable damages, and aging equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2344)|
| 0:39:14| And lastly, but certainly not least, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2367)|
| 0:39:57| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2397)|
| 0:40:27| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2427)|
| 0:40:57| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2457)|
| 0:41:27| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2487)|
| 0:41:57| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2517)|
| 0:42:27| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2547)|
| 0:42:57| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2577)|
| 0:43:27| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2607)|

| 0:44:27| And finally, ELA and math data highlight the need for more intensive support for English learners, particularly those who are new to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2667)|
| 0:44:57| So our key accomplishments at this point in this team is that we actually have had a pilot program going on at Central High School and also at Sarah Moore Green Magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2697)|
| 0:45:06| So we have looked at putting some of our strategies and processes in operation to make sure that they can work effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2706)|
| 0:45:17| We actually have held our first administrators meeting where we have rolled this out and we are looking at introducing this so that they can begin thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2717)|
| 0:45:24| what do I need for my school? We have looked at securing funding and we have found funding for staff training through other funding streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2724)|
| 0:45:36| I said we didn't use ESSER funds for this 4A, but actually we have other funding streams that when the administrators or the staff come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2736)|
| 0:45:45| we're not expecting them just to do this. We're actually trying to make sure that they have a stipend to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2745)|
| 0:45:54| Because there's some responsibility that goes along with it. If we're going to make change, it has to have accountability and responsibility with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2754)|
| 0:46:03| So our next steps for 4A, we're going to implement two more trainings this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| The next one will be with the staff who are going to be kind of the lead staff in the support team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| And then in May we'll do a meeting with the administrators and the staff all together so that we can dig into what their actual school plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2775)|
| 0:46:23| What their programs are going to look like. So they can plan their trainings over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| We're going to provide individual support for the whole child support teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| We're going to have our staff go and work along with other members of the teams that would be offering support to find out what the schools need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| and help them really individualize the supports, the team process that they're going to utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2804)|
| 0:46:55| And then over next school year, we're going to, throughout the year, provide professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| A lot of this is based on professional development. We need to make sure that the people have the knowledge and the skill sets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| So we are going to go ahead and provide year-long trainings for the leaders of the whole child support teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2829)|
| 0:47:20| So are we leaving questions until the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| Or if you have questions on 4A before I pass it on to 4B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| So I'm going to pass it on to Paula Sarver in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| So just for the flow of it, we actually do have some work that we are doing in 4B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| And I'll let Paula introduce the structure of 4B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| Dr. Murphy talked a lot about the mental health supports and some of the structures that we need to provide student supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| And that would fall under 4B, and that would fall under our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| And what we're looking to do is put out, and we have RFPs in the process right now for additional mental health counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| We're looking to provide structures of crisis support for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| Some of that is through funding someone who is at the top tier, almost like a mobile crisis support person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| along with partnering with some of our community organizations, which is not funded through ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2905)|
| 0:48:34| We're looking at providing a therapist for our staff, because this has been a tough year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| Our staff are really kind of struggling, and we understand that, and we want to support our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| We need to take care of our staff so our staff can take care of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| This is not a long-time therapy. This is really somebody who can step in in the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| We're also looking at providing supports and expanding the restorative practice works that we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2939)|
| 0:49:08| We have schools who have had considerable interrupted learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| We're looking at what supports does that school district need, or what that school or those families of schools need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2954)|
| 0:49:23| to get back on track and support their restorative practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| How can we have a restorative intervention and expand what we already do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| We have restorative practices in all our middle school and high schools, but this is more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| It's more focused. We have an RFP that's going out for supporting us in the district to expand our restorative practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2982)|
| 0:49:51| As you listen to Ms. Sarver, this falls into 4B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=2991)|
| 0:50:02| Ms. Cook, I do have one question. Can you tell us what the typical makeup of a whole child support team looks like at a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| Who are the different types of roles that would be involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| Without getting too technical, what's the kind of support they're providing at the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| If you can give some examples of how they would provide that support at a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| The makeup of the team really depends on what the principal will get to choose the makeup of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| The people who are involved, there's an administrator that leads it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| The social worker is typically involved. The counseling department is represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| The instructional department is represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| Typically, if a school has the old pit team, they would have at the beginning of the pit team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| they would have mental health professionals come in and share, but they can't be part of the team because of confidentiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3056)|
| 0:51:03| There's a variety of different elements. It's that blend between the academics and the other supports that a student would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3063)|
| 0:51:12| It depends on what a school wants to put on the team. The principal gets to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| When you said old pit team, does that mean that this is supposed to replace the pit team model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| This is going to expand. We have pit teams and we have a variety of different types and levels of pit team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| When pit team was developed many years ago, the supports and services that we have at this point in our world are much greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3092)|
| 0:51:42| We need to make sure that we have people who are on the team who can access and know how to utilize all the supports that are out there for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| Is it fair to say that this whole child support team would be more robust and would have more capabilities than a traditional pit team might have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3109)|
| 0:52:01| I think that we're focusing on providing more expertise to the staff who are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| A lot of this, we're looking at providing them the expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| If a child goes and they may be needed to sit in time away in a classroom, we have calming corners in some classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3134)|
| 0:52:24| If you don't have knowledge, you don't have expertise and you don't know the reasoning behind why you have a calming corner and what the brain science is behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3144)|
| 0:52:33| it's just a very pretty time out area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| We have staff who are equipped to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| Professional development is really part of this whole child team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| We need to make sure that we're keeping up with all the strategies and resources that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| It sounds like a significant part of the training is the why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| In continuing with Strategy 4B on interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3183)|
| 0:53:17| our status level is three out of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| The implementation updates is a collaboration between departments in writing an RFP for interventions and forming the review committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3203)|
| 0:53:34| Special education teacher committees have been formed to select materials and equipment for apartment living for students with relevant pre-vocational goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3214)|
| 0:53:45| They're working on obtaining bids and quotes for purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| What we're trying to do is to expand the options that we have for interventions for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| This is to support Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 special education, as well as ELL students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| Why do we need additional information or interventions or to expand on the interventions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| It's because different interventions can address the various needs of our students so that we can close the skill gaps that the students have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3251)|
| 0:54:20| Our goal here is to fit the program and the supports that we give to our students into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| Our goal is to meet the individual needs of the students rather than fitting the students to a particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3267)|
| 0:54:35| Our key accomplishments that we've had is that we've gone through the procurement for the expansion of research-based student intervention materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| That is ongoing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| Our special education teacher committees have been formed to select materials and equipment for the apartment living for students with relevant pre-vocational goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| Our next steps, once we go through procurement, we will be able to choose good interventions and submit the requisitions for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3296)|
| 0:55:05| Submitting the requisitions and the space allocations that will be needed for the apartment living initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| Then we will have to provide training to the staff for the expansion and implementation of these interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3312)|
| 0:55:25| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| It's mainly because of the phrase apartment living. You don't often connect that with an educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| Can you speak more directly to what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| This is to help our special ed students that are in CDCA classes so that they have the skills when they go out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3350)|
| 0:56:04| I appreciate you making that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| I just think for folks who don't have to navigate that in their own lives, most of us don't think I've got to do something specific with my child about how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| I think it's important to elevate that for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| That's a part of our role and responsibility as a school system for our kids who have those needs to be able to help provide that level of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| It's important that we implement those supports with integrity and that we track their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| We currently use our student information system, Aspen, to record interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| which means there's no additional cost for tracking the new supports that we are providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| Our implementation goal is to have a varied menu of academic interventions in place, aligned and utilized by the fall of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| Ultimately, we want to align the interventions with students' needs so that we can decrease the number of students in Tiers 2 and 3 and increase benchmark scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3426)|
| 0:57:21| That's on AimswebPlus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| This strategy is currently at Level 4, as most of the items are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3447)|
| 0:57:36| Tracking the new interventions includes gathering baseline data of current academic supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| so noting where we are currently with the interventions that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| and expanding the menu of research-based interventions available for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| Key accomplishments include expanding that menu of research-based interventions and getting those into the procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| and also creating a tool that will help teachers provide support to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| Our next steps include completing the data collection, procuring the new intervention options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| and training school-based leaders on how to best utilize supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| This strategy is the mechanism that we'll use to ensure that we have successfully implemented the previously mentioned strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3501)|
| 0:58:32| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm really not trying to be 100% here, but I do have a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| You mentioned that there's no additional cost because we can track this in Aspen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| I don't know a lot of the details about Aspen. I know my kids use it, and I've been on there and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| Are we just trying to make do because we already have Aspen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| Currently in Aspen, we have student plans for all of our students that are in Tiers 2 and 3 through RTI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| Part of that plan includes which intervention they're receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| I want to carefully choose my words and not say that it's easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| but it's an export, a data export that we can pull to see the number of students that are in a specific intervention and track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| Would it be fair to say it's adequate but not ideal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| It gives us the information that we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| At this point, we need to move to some sort of dashboard tracking system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| because what we're really looking to see is are we utilizing the interventions that we have in place or that we have available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| I think that's critical information. I just want to make sure you all have timely, easy access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| It's real time. It's a report that can be exported or run as a quick report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3603)|
| 1:00:12| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Thank you. I just want to piggyback on what Christine Sandesh and I were just talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| To answer your question even a little more, the power of Aspen, it's not that it's inadequate to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| It's the one-stop shop that folks are used to going to. I think Christine would agree with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| It's what we look at for grades. It's a database that has a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| It's one that councils are used to going to and administrators are used to going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| There could be some capability, as Dr. Murphy and I were just talking about, even in a forecast 5 that could do that if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| I think instead of retraining everybody, if Aspen has that capability, again, Freddie knows this far better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| Typically, we can write in additional programming and additional pieces to Aspen. There's a cost with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| That's what we're looking to do. How can we have it all in one spot so schools are used to using it? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| Thank you, Madam Chair. Hi. Thank you for coming and speaking on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| I do have a child who does receive intervention support, so this is something I'm pretty interested in, just as a mom as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3678)|
| 1:01:26| Typically, currently, what grade level do they start getting intervention services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| Intervention can begin as early as kindergarten. It all depends on the need that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3692)|
| 1:01:40| Since this is something I am interested in, I just want to make sure that we're going to see even more children struggling in the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3700)|
| 1:01:49| It's definitely something I want to make sure that we're being proactive on and not reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| I know our situation was more reactive than proactive with intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| Thank you so much for doing all this work and making this a priority for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| Thank you. Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3728)|
| 1:02:18| Moving on to technology and facilities portion of priority four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| These are the pieces that technology department is specifically responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| These are the things that we as a department own and oversee going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| Our goal is to maintain our technology investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| We want to create a safe and healthy learning environment through improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| We're going to do this through three primary ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| We wanted to ensure that each teacher gets access to a digital interactive flat panel in their classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| Through the pandemic, we saw very disparate access to the technology tools that the teachers have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| We wanted to ensure that we were listening to their needs and being able to provide across the board regardless of where the teacher may be with the best tools that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3786)|
| 1:03:17| Our implementation goal is to create a safe digital learning environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| We want to make sure that we're keeping our students safe online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3803)|
| 1:03:32| Our goals are fairly easy to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| We're going to quarterly measure that increase of access to our teachers with access to modern and reliable technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| This is at a level four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| We're currently still primarily in the planning and preparation phase for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| We do have a big key accomplishment and that's that we've created a system wide inventory of the boards, projectors, TVs, all of the things that are in use in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3837)|
| 1:04:07| Our team went out in February to make sure that we had the most recent information that we could at all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| We also through the RFP process had a wonderful panel of our educators, school administrators, and then support staff at the vendor demonstrations for our interactive panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3854)|
| 1:04:25| So they spent about half a day going through the two vendor demonstrations with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| And then obviously the RFP is complete and it is before the board tonight for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| So that is a big step because it just takes so long to get some of this technology in our hands and then installed for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3877)|
| 1:04:46| Next step being this contract approval answering any questions that you may have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| Identifying a vendor for our IT security risk assessment and then doing the reporting and analysis needed to make sure that all of our student devices are ready for school in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| Any questions about the technology portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| Mr. Jin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| Thank you Madam Chair. You briefly mentioned that you had a whole district wide inventory of the various technologies in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| What is the current situation regarding panels and projectors and stuff in our classrooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| So currently we only had about 18% of our teachers have a modern panel of some kind regardless of vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3925)|
| 1:05:34| So that turned out to be around 800 or so panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| From that we had a wide variety. Most of them were the older interactive boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| These are pretty typical in the front of the classroom with a much smaller percentage just being basically TVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| Whatever we could get for the best price at the time that fit the need in that classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| Thank you Madam Chair. I just want to say I appreciate the inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3964)|
| 1:06:22| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=3982)|
| 1:06:52| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4012)|
| 1:07:22| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4042)|
| 1:07:52| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4072)|
| 1:08:22| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4102)|
| 1:08:52| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4132)|
| 1:09:22| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4162)|
| 1:09:53| Thank you guys for your patience with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| I know that these first four sharing outs of these priorities are a little lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| But they will be more expeditious at the next go around because we just want to make sure we share the implementation goals of what we're actually doing with that whole piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4205)|
| 1:10:14| But this one is a quick graphic put together just to show you guys the action steps that are in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| We have 54% of our action steps are on track with priority four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| We have 12% that are completed already and then we have 14% that are in minor delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| This is another final chart here that we've created overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| We're at a level three with this status. We have 80% four out of five of our strategies are at a level three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| We have 74% on track and then we have 14% with delays and we do have 19% that have not been started yet based on timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4244)|
| 1:10:53| And it should be noted that we have 87 total action steps with this priority alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| So just letting you guys know that the level of the work that this team is doing, we're extremely proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| Because it's a very varied, as you can tell, very varied priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| All rolled into one and so we meet weekly on that and they do a really good job with this whole piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| Any questions on this component?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| So that does conclude our presentation for today and just give you guys a reminder that next month in May we'll be sharing out with priority two effective educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| Thank you, Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| Yeah, if your mic's reset you might have to tap your screen to get back to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4296)|
| 1:11:45| Are we all good? So did anybody have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| Okay, so moving on to the discussion of the regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4312)|
| 1:12:00| Board Member Superintendent Thomas and I agreed to add item 10E regarding the Title IX management and claims to our April 6th agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4320)|
| 1:12:09| We can have discussion on that additional item as we go through the meeting agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| So we'll start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4335)|
| 1:12:28| So under items in contract C, does anybody have any questions about 1 or 2, 3 or 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4348)|
| 1:12:45| Item 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| Board Policy 7A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| Thank you, Madam Chair. At our policy review meeting on March 23rd when we discussed this policy, I lifted up for discussion the idea of us possibly coming up with a way to allow board members to express interest in serving as chair or vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4384)|
| 1:13:15| Mr. Dupler and I worked on that and he looked into the law and what the possibilities were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| It seems pretty clear, Mr. Dupler, from what you found, and correct me if I'm wrong, that if we were to do that it would have to happen in the context of a publicly noticed meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4403)|
| 1:13:35| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| It would have to be a particular type of meeting, but it certainly has to be some type of publicly noticed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| So my intent in this is, I think it would behoove all of us as a board in making that decision of who serves in those capacities to have some idea of who's interested in serving in those prior to the meeting that we're supposed to decide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4428)|
| 1:14:02| I just think a 30 minute meeting to get some understanding of who wants to serve in that and also make that decision is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4442)|
| 1:14:11| I think it would help the board to know who has some interest in that and so that way we can be making and thinking through our own decision making process in deciding that vote beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4451)|
| 1:14:21| I've sent it to Mr. Dupler, he's going to be reviewing it for our meeting on Wednesday, but the language that I'm suggesting that we add to this policy, which let me pull up the line, it would be in line six right after the sentence that ends in the word board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| Prior to the annual meeting in September to elect officers, board members will be asked to state their interest in being considered to serve as the chair and or vice chair for the upcoming year at the August work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| Board members who do not express their interest at the August work session would remain eligible for consideration by the board at the annual meeting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4472)|
| 1:15:03| So basically one month ahead of time at that work session there would be a discussion for any board member to say, hey I have interest in serving and they could say why or whatever in one of these roles, but the board would still be able to vote on and elect anybody who doesn't express interest at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4503)|
| 1:15:22| So it's not to eliminate people from the pool, it's so that way the people who do have a specific interest can voice that interest at that meeting and the board would be able to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4522)|
| 1:15:33| And the board can openly consider that as a possibility. So that's my suggestion to change that policy to make that possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4533)|
| 1:15:44| Thank you Madam Chair. Mr. Watson, how would new board members express their interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4544)|
| 1:15:53| So I appreciate the question. Mr. Dupler and I also spoke to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| A new board member could, prior to being sworn in as a board member, could express that interest in any way they want prior to coming on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4559)|
| 1:16:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| So any more comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| So 7C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| E or F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| G or H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| I or J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4606)|
| 1:16:53| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to kind of give some additional insight on why a policy like this could be helpful for our district, even if it's just a matter of providing a framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4613)|
| 1:17:06| So the first and foremost is it was presented by our Superintendent Thomas, and he is our employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| And he came to the board and said, hey, board, this is the work that we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| This is what our staff has said we need to do to continue on this work. Let's implement this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| So our employee came to us and said, this is what we need. So that's one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| Second reason is we haven't, and we talk about this every year, but we don't evaluate our superintendent on academic data because we don't ever have the data in time because it comes from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4652)|
| 1:17:39| And so this is a great opportunity for us to track our own data and use our own data to measure the new superintendent that's coming into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4659)|
| 1:17:55| And then lastly, a point is that policy is powerful, and policy moves systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| And so for us to go in the direction that we all want us to go in, because I do believe you all do care about the disparities of education, I know that to be true, it's going to continue to stay flat if we're not moving the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4682)|
| 1:18:17| And so policies are, the purpose of policies are to move systems forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| And so if we want to see the system move forward in Knox County schools, we have to implement the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| Absolutely not. But what it will do is lay out a framework and guidance for people to say, this is what Knox County schools means when it comes to equity and policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4710)|
| 1:18:39| So I understand it lives within our system, and I understand that everyone is supposedly supposed to be doing it, but a policy is in place to move a system forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4719)|
| 1:18:49| And so those are three reasons that I can't figure out a way why we would not, that you can justify for those reasons not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| But the biggest one is because our employees said, this is what we need to move our district forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| And at the end of the day, we, again, we're not measuring on academic achievement for the top role of a school system, which is kind of problematic when you think about it, and we need to start collecting our own data to give some type of measurement for our superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4743)|
| 1:19:18| And then we got to move the system forward, y'all. So that's just all I have to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4758)|
| 1:19:26| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Ms. Satterfield. I agree with the reasons that you mentioned and wanted to add a couple of thoughts to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| And this is some of the conversations, just echoes to some of the conversations we've had over the last couple of months about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| We, at one point in one of our meetings, talked about equity and the definition of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| But we need to make sure that we have a common, formal definition, that everyone, our board, our staff, our educators, all know what we mean when we say educational equity as Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4788)|
| 1:19:59| And also, though we have made some progress, and like Ms. Satterfield said, I know that we all want this, we still have significant inequities and disparities that persist across our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4799)|
| 1:20:11| Too often, student demographics, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics predict educational outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| And unlike this, no longer the case, we have not achieved true equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| We haven't as a district, and frankly, I don't know of any district in the country that would claim that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| So it takes focus and intentionality, and I also agree that policy is designed to move systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| Even in the contract that we're considering for Dr. Reiswick, there's a part in there that talks about an annual plan and having metrics aligned with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| And I think my interest in doing this, even though part of this, and this has been raised, part of this is addressed in our current strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4843)|
| 1:20:53| I think Knox County Schools need to be focusing on this, regardless of whether or not it's in our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| And at some point, that strategic plan will change, and policy allows us to keep that thread throughout, regardless of whether or not it's highlighted in the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| And then as far as the seven commitments that are highlighted in this equity policy, I think there's some wisdom to aligning the work that we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4866)|
| 1:21:17| Both with ESSA at a federal level, but also with the Tennessee Leaders for Education Equity playbook that's been in development since 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4877)|
| 1:21:27| And knowing the research that's gone into that, and the study that's gone into that, knowing that these seven commitments, if they can truly be addressed in a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4887)|
| 1:21:36| you'll see monumental shifts in the disparities. And so that's one of the reasons why I'm supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| And again, I think policy is that thread that ties everything that we do together over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4902)|
| 1:21:50| And that's why I think this needs to live in policy and not just be in a temporary strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd like to talk about why I cannot support this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| I alluded to it a couple of months ago and had hoped that some other folks would look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| A great deal of the equity language came from the Leaders for Equity playbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| which was developed with major input from individuals and organizations whose focus is the privatization of public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4939)|
| 1:22:30| Adopting policy language from such a publication without really careful and thoughtful research into how that will impact our schools is irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4950)|
| 1:22:47| The organizations that worked on this, some of the organizations that worked on this, I cannot say all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| they have a privatization agenda that includes the proliferation of charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4974)|
| 1:23:02| And they have links to organizations such as the City Fund, individuals like Kevin Huffman, Teach for America, Bill Gates, Betsy DeVos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4982)|
| 1:23:12| the Council for Chief State School Officers, the Walton Foundation, ALEC, David Koch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, School Board Partners, and many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| And the last one that I named, School Board Partners, is based in New Orleans where 93 of their schools are charter schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5004)|
| 1:23:36| and they have 96 total schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| And it is when we are looking at language that comes from somewhere else that we find out who is behind that language and how it is being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5022)|
| 1:23:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| So any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| Moving on to grants, A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| Sorry, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| This is actually the grant that matches for the tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| So about 60% of that comes out of the ESSER funding and this is the other 40% for, I think it is 216 tutors total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| My paper copy is different than the one on the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| Is it the one for the Tennessee Accelerating Literacy and Learning, is that the one you are talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| That is correct. So that is the 40% from the state for the tutoring grant and then we have matching funds that are 60% through the ESSER grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| Okay, so again under grants, item B or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| I have a question about the best restraint grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| Mr. Oaks, so can you just go through what this would entail because I know there has been a lot of discussion about this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5128)|
| 1:25:38| So can you just talk about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| Yes, ma'am. This is a grant from the state of Tennessee. We have had it in previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| The only participant we have in that is one of our small bus contractors and this is to assist him to defer the cost of buying a new small bus and it would be equipped with seatbelts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5148)|
| 1:26:04| All of our small buses are equipped with seatbelts so this does not change anything in the way we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| Okay, got it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| So item D under grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| Moving on to contracts, 9A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Thank you, Madam Chair. I do have a question about B, but also I think maybe I completely missed it and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5190)|
| 1:26:36| Were we able to ask questions about C1, the approval of the fuel stipend for bus and shuttle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| I don't know. That was when I was looking for my glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| That's okay. You mind if I ask a question about that real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| I just wanted to know, I know that's a short-term solution, I mean short-term solution to what I hope is a short-term problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| but is there a long-term solution that's been considered for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| This is around the fuel stipend for bus and shuttle contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| At this point, given how volatile fuel is, we're sort of working short-term solution to short-term solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5227)|
| 1:27:19| Fuel, this is not the only fuel support that we provide to our contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5239)|
| 1:27:29| There's a fuel line that's built into their contract and then we also provide a fuel reimbursement basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5249)|
| 1:27:41| or to support for them basically when fuel gets above $2.85 a gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| So we pay on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| The contract that we have set up lapses when fuel reaches $4.30 a gallon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5271)|
| 1:27:59| and so this is to sort of cover the difference between now and the end of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| for what our fuel index does not provide since fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5286)|
| 1:28:14| and we base our index on the most expensive fuel, whether it's gasoline or diesel, on the first day of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5294)|
| 1:28:24| and we're above $4.30 now and we anticipate we will remain that way through the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5304)|
| 1:28:32| So this is to cover the gap between that and then we'll see where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| and see what we may need to do as we get closer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| Do you anticipate something new to be added to the budget for this in terms of a long-term solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| I would let Ron weigh into that, but my first thought is we have not generally budgeted fuel index in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5326)|
| 1:29:00| Again, because fuel is so volatile, we can be paying one month and not paying the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| And given where we are with our reserves, I would really sort of like to hold fire on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5348)|
| 1:29:18| and wait and see what happens with fuel costs, but Mr. McPherson may have a better idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5358)|
| 1:29:27| I totally agree with Russ about this. There's already some building contingencies with contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| so something like this would be even more, and I think with the volatility of the gas prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5374)|
| 1:29:42| at least in the position we're at now, I think it would be better to address it with reserves if we need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5382)|
| 1:29:52| Thank you. And then my question around the grant that was brought up, item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| I ran into some misinformation in the community, and I just want to make sure that it's corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| I had some folks reach out that were concerned that we were spending $500,000 per panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| This is actually 4,000 panels across 80 or 90 schools, correct? It's about $3,500 per panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| That's correct, yes. So the contract price was around $2,400 per panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| but then after you add installation, removal of the old equipment, any additional cabling work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| things that we may need to do, we budgeted around $3,500 so that we could touch every classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| And earlier you said prior to this initiative, only about 18 percent of our classrooms had a panel in their room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| Yes, the average age of this equipment was between 7 and 12 years old, just depending on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| Honestly, some of our newer schools had it worse because everything was new 12 or 15 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| and they haven't been able to adjust to that. So it really just depended on the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5454)|
| 1:31:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| Okay, back to contracts, item C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| Okay, moving on to regular agenda items, 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5472)|
| 1:31:21| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| I'm looking at a paper version. I want to make sure I'm on the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| This is the approved school construction budget line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Okay, I'm sorry. I have a question about the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| Okay, so 10B. No questions on A? Okay. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| Thank you, Madam Chair. So the transfer of this $2 million from the land acquisition account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| for this Title IX case at West High School Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| do we anticipate any shortfalls or issues running into future land acquisition needs by making this transfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5508)|
| 1:31:56| What we're working right now, we have $5 million in that account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| and the only land acquisition we're working right now is the purchase of property for a new elementary school in the Farragut area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5522)|
| 1:32:12| And those discussions are ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| We're in the process of doing our due diligence on site right now to determine suitability of a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5535)|
| 1:32:23| But based on current, and again, this is volatile too, but based on current property prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5543)|
| 1:32:32| we think we'll be in good shape with what we have remaining in that account to take care of that property acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5552)|
| 1:32:42| And then future property acquisition would come through future capital plans, and we would have to look at those at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| So this is just a way to get money that we currently have immediately into an account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| so that we can go ahead and execute a project across future land acquisition needs when we get to those bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5576)|
| 1:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| So any more discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| So item 10C and 10D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5600)|
| 1:33:32| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| I had a couple questions, and I didn't see Mr. Bolton here, so I'm not sure who can ask those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| But I was curious, so with the contract for Dr. Reiswick, when do we start reassigning principals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| When do we start kind of hiring staff for the next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| And when do people in the school start, if you're in a school, when are you brought into central office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| Does that all kind of, when does that happen exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5638)|
| 1:34:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| That's kind of a fluid situation at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| I know with respect to the hiring of, we give at-risk schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| Are you speaking with respect to coming into central office specifically or hiring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| Well, more so, so we're coming into the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| So when principals start getting reassigned for the next school year, or we start hiring teachers for the next school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| when does that typically occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| It really depends on the classification of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| I'd have to go back and look at the calendar, but I can get an answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| So with respect to at-risk schools, they have the first priority on the hiring process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5680)|
| 1:34:49| We have already discussed with principals their staffing allocations, so they're already thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5689)|
| 1:34:58| We've already extended offers to some, as Mr. Thomas had said, to some teachers or teacher candidates just from the recruiting fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5698)|
| 1:35:07| So I can get a breakdown of the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| There's multiple data points on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| Different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| Anyway, I'm just trying to think of kind of this transitional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| Is there any way to do that in July, or is that too late in the process, or is it too close to the school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5723)|
| 1:35:33| Well, we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| That's not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| So the process in having these discussions would occur a couple of months, even in May, June, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5738)|
| 1:35:52| So let me say it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| We wouldn't wait before the hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| We wouldn't start that process in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| I hate to use this word, business as usual, and getting those in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| And we work with principals, obviously, in making those recommendations for their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| And with respect to the principal placements themselves, there is a process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5774)|
| 1:36:21| There's a human resources process where we would vet the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| Obviously, grade-level directors are heavily involved in that process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| I'm just curious if it would make sense to push Dr. Reiswick's start date up and maybe talk about Mr. Thomas being in an advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5791)|
| 1:36:41| I'm just trying to think of a seamless transition for this with the new school year coming into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| That's something I wanted to bring up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| And I will just say that Superintendent Thomas and Mr. Dupler and I also had that conversation just talking through some different scenarios late last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5810)|
| 1:37:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| I could have Mr. Dupler speak to that or Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| I think you were next if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| I have the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| I think that if we have a contract, well, when we began this process, we didn't know if our candidate would be coming from outside the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5834)|
| 1:37:22| Since we do have an internal candidate who could start earlier than July 1st, I think that we seriously need to consider doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5842)|
| 1:37:32| Because I think that typically those decisions about principal movements are made in May at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| So if we wait until July 1st, I don't feel like that's going to give Dr. Ryswick enough time to tweak whatever he wants to tweak and really be in place before the year gets started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5859)|
| 1:37:50| We often hear from teachers who are not happy about things being given to them with too short a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5870)|
| 1:37:58| So I definitely think that we are opening ourselves up to that happening if we don't have a new superintendent in place until after July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5878)|
| 1:38:08| So I would hope that what we could do is I'm not proposing to change Superintendent Thomas' contract at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5888)|
| 1:38:18| That's not what my thought is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| I like the idea of an advisory role that Ms. Henderson brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| But whatever we need to do, I think, just to allow Dr. Ryswick to go ahead and get started, and I would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5906)|
| 1:38:36| I mean, I would propose we do that for May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| We're now the first or second week of April, so that would give a little bit of a transition time between the two of them, even still for the rest of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5919)|
| 1:38:50| But then really allow that transition to take place a lot sooner than we had originally planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| I do have some specific questions about the contract, but wanted to speak to the issue at hand as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| So correct me if I'm wrong, I believe that we brought up the possibility through the process of developing our action plan around hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5945)|
| 1:39:14| around the possibility of them two overlapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| Obviously at that time we didn't know it would be Dr. Ryswick, but we talked about the potential incoming superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| and I believe Mr. Thomas even spoke to being favorable to that at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| And I think there was a recommendation, again, my memory is not great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| but I think there was a recommendation from the search committee at the time to not do that based on feedback from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| And if so, can you remind us what that feedback was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| Madam Chair, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| The feedback was that it will be convoluted on who staff reports to in that kind of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5990)|
| 1:39:58| and who do they listen to when it comes to giving directives in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| So, I mean, we will have to make a definite switch if that goes into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| but that was the feedback from Tammy is that it just causes too much chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| I was favorable to that at the time, but I think kind of midstream it feels difficult to really implement well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6014)|
| 1:40:21| Dr. Ryswick, can you speak to your potential readiness to start in that role at the proposed time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| My guess is you've been thinking about how to transition well and end well in your current role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| so can you speak to some of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| I would say, first of all, that there is a lot to do in a transition plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| I mean, I think that's important to work on, and we have put a lot of thought into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| and obviously we'll work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| I want to say, though, I mean, Bob and I get along great, and we have since we've worked together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6052)|
| 1:40:59| So our communication, I think even through this process, has been a good communication process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6059)|
| 1:41:07| I would just say, I mean, I want to make sure, just me personally, and I think the district as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| that he's celebrated for his service and for what he has meant and what he's done for Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6073)|
| 1:41:20| and I definitely want to do that and, again, get along great with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| We've worked out fine with how we've worked up to now, and I would say, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| there are things that we still need to do in the transition and planning we need to do to get those things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| With that said, you know, obviously I serve with the will of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| and want to do what's best for Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| So, I mean, you know, we'll get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| So, Dr. Robinson, I appreciate the way you're answering it, and I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| I mean, I totally understand, but, you know, the question's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| So I specifically want to know, do you feel competent and ready to step in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| and that you can still accomplish all the other things you want to do exiting your current role in that time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| And, again, I get celebrating Bob, and I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| I get that you all work together well and all the things, and that you serve at the will of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| but this board member is asking you, do you think it's going to hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| You know, I mean, there are things we're still working through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| I mean, obviously in a transition that you work through, there's a plan and a timeline for communicating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| and for talking through those transitions and doing all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| As far as, you know, do I feel competently that I could be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| I mean, especially with him in a consulting role, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| I mean, I think, you know, I don't think I would have applied if I didn't feel like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| So I feel confident on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| But, like I said, you know, in these times, how we do the timeline on that and how we roll that thing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| there's a lot to communicate internally to staff as well as to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| And that's mainly what I'm asking about, is there adequate time to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Yeah, I mean, you know, I think we can make either scenario work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| My plan and timeline has been built on July 1 and working well with Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| But, yeah, I mean, I think whichever works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| I don't feel like we could do it and move forward when we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| But, again, there's a lot of big pieces still to be communicated in the transition to internal and external folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| And, Mr. Thomas, I mean, respect to both of you all, but I don't want the politically correct answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| I want to know your thoughts as well in terms of actually managing the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6214)|
| 1:43:42| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Forgot to push a button there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| As Dr. Reiswick-John said, we've worked together very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| And we've talked about this in terms of the budget decisions, personnel decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| Those decisions need to be Dr. Reiswick's decisions because I won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| And I think, you know, the time has probably allowed Dr. Reiswick to enjoy this period a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6240)|
| 1:44:12| in terms of the stress that comes with the job and the pressures that come with the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| So, you know, it's good from that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| But, listen, I've worked for this school district for 49 years almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| I know you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| And I have tried to do the best that I could do for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| You know, I was required to give a 90-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| I gave a nine-month notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| I wanted to make sure that the board had ample time to select the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| And Dr. Reiswick, I think, is a great selection and will do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| I guess the concern for me, too, is that, you know, through my contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| I would appreciate it being able to serve in some capacity for the remainder of my contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| which would be through June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| If that's in an advisory capacity or consultant capacity, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| I serve at the pleasure of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| And I'm your only employee, so, you know, I want to do what you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6309)|
| 1:45:16| and to do what's best for this school district and the students, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| and the employees, second of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| So I think Dr. Reiswick, I don't think it's a bad idea at all with the timing on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| just because of the fact that once July 1 comes, as John and I were talking about this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| once July 4 is over, it's summer is about over for whatever summer we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| So it really ramps up at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| And we try to make principal decisions, you know, in the month of May a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| because we'd like for school staff to know when they leave for summer break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| We'd like for school staff to know who their principal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| Certainly we get some surprises sometimes after school's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| But, you know, those decisions within the next several weeks are going to have to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| need to be made so staff and parents and families know who their school leaders are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| And, you know, in terms of any reorganization for the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| it would work best, you know, to have that in place before July 1 as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| because, again, things really happen fast after that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| So I don't know if I've answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| I'm just willing to work with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| I appreciate both of you weighing into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| I mean, I saw the wisdom in us doing this when we started talking about it four or five months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| I just want to make sure that if now as a board we're considering changing what we decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| that we're real clear on why and all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| So, I mean, I totally see the wisdom in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| I just want to, I don't want to just pass by it casually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| You know, I want to make sure that we're really intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| And at least me, I want to kind of think through the implications and the reasons for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| And you two are the best to speak to it, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| So I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| And I do have specific questions about the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| But, I mean, if others want to speak to the larger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| Yeah, I want to speak to that just really quick and say my conversations with Superintendent Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6425)|
| 1:47:13| and Dr. Reislick both have been very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| I mean, they obviously are friends and have a great relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| There's not really been any awkwardness there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| So I do appreciate both of you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| And as I said, we did have a conversation late last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| Mr. Dupler, we had talked about how this was not unprecedented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| as far as someone serving in a consultant capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| Could you just speak a little bit to that and then we'll move back to Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| So in Mr. Thomas' contract, there is a clause in there that talks about his tenure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6470)|
| 1:47:57| which he certainly has with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| So if this board were to decide to accelerate Dr. Reislick's contract, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6480)|
| 1:48:09| then the board would need to honor Mr. Thomas' contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| which as has been suggested, he would need to be put into some other role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| whether it's called a consultant or advisory or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| So that's certainly an option in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| And as Madam Chair stated, I mean, that's been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| Certainly the most recent example on the superintendent level was when there was an intern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| Buzz Thomas came in, there was an overlap between him and Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6523)|
| 1:48:53| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| I guess having listened to all that was said here, I agree with pretty much all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6538)|
| 1:49:11| But I'm wondering if we might not, under the circumstances, like each of them said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6551)|
| 1:49:26| they worked extremely well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| And as Bob said, the organization for changes and stuff begins in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6571)|
| 1:49:42| Now, you know, maybe if you want to tell somebody if they're going to have a different principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6582)|
| 1:49:51| you need to have it done by the, you know, before school's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| But I'm just wondering if, I can't envision, I might be wrong, just speaking for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6597)|
| 1:50:09| I can see what TSBA, where they had some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| But I'm wondering, I can't envision John wanting to do something while Bob's still superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6615)|
| 1:50:28| and him rejecting that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| It would, in my opinion, it would have to be extremely drastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| because he just said that John was going to be here and it was going to be his plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6638)|
| 1:50:47| And given that situation, what would you think about keeping the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6647)|
| 1:50:58| but allowing Bob to stay superintendent through graduations up until June 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6658)|
| 1:51:14| That would mean he would have 30 days left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| But he would retain the official power up to that point with John making suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6679)|
| 1:51:30| or I actually envision them working together to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| But you have to have, at the end of the day, you have to have somebody that puts the rubber stamp on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| And I would think that five decades of service would allow him, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6702)|
| 1:51:55| that position and that amount of authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6715)|
| 1:52:03| But it's just obviously, you know, whatever the board decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6723)|
| 1:52:10| But I believe that would be, in my opinion, that would be an easier, would make for an easier transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6730)|
| 1:52:19| Then you're not, you don't have to go to a situation like what you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6739)|
| 1:52:26| where you just buy out the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| The public would not like that, I believe, from a political standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| But I've said enough. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| Ms. Hoyne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| You know, the issue, well, first of all, let me just say this, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| this really doesn't have a, is no reflection on Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| We're really talking about the health of the organization going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| and being able to have personnel in place in the month of May, as Mr. Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6779)|
| 1:53:06| and having school be ready really in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| Because when teachers come back at the end of July, August, we have to be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| So it's really more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| Mr. McMillan, I appreciate your comments about graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| And it had crossed my mind as I'm thinking about this that, you know, perhaps, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| of course we're still, you know, Mr. Thomas is still on contract anyway through the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| So perhaps Mr. Thomas could represent and be at all the graduations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| and be able to finish that process even if he is currently serving in the role as an advisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6818)|
| 1:53:47| or whatever that term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| And so, you know, maybe that's a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6829)|
| 1:53:55| Because I think that going back to Mr. Watson brought up the TSBA's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| about not having more than one chief at a time because you have to have one person that's in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6841)|
| 1:54:08| So I think regardless of how well two people get along, I feel like I'm yelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| This is really loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Regardless of how well two people get along, I think you still have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| there always has to be one decision maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| And so since decisions are made in May that are of utmost importance for the following school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6864)|
| 1:54:32| that's why I think that we need to make this transition at the beginning of May for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| And I think for that reason you have to have a hard and fast cutoff or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| so that everybody knows who's in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| It's not fair to staff if they don't know if they should go to Mr. Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| or if they should go to Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| It's not fair to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| So I think we need a hard and fast cutoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| At the same time, I think that Superintendent Thomas has seen, you know, this graduating class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| He's been the superintendent the whole time they've been in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| And so it would be lovely for him to be able to be there in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| So that would be a suggestion I would offer up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| Mr. McMillan, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| And then Ms. Owen, you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| Well, I was just going to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| I understand what you're saying, Ms. Horne, and I agree to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6931)|
| 1:55:39| But I think this is, again, this is my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6939)|
| 1:55:45| I think that, I mean, maybe you could go until after the last high school graduation if you wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6945)|
| 1:55:56| with Mr. Thomas being the superintendent, official superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6956)|
| 1:56:03| Dr. Reiswick will be superintendent for, if I'm correct, for many, many graduations in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6963)|
| 1:56:13| And I'm sure it wouldn't bother him from that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| And again, I reiterate, you know, they can make these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| If they need to start making them first week in May, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| I'd almost bet you and give you really strong odds that Bob Thomas will not reject anything that John Reiswick proposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=6990)|
| 1:56:44| while he's officially superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| Mr. Thomas, is this a conversation that you and Dr. Reiswick have had at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| We talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| We spoke briefly this afternoon about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| We've had previous conversations about decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| That's been pretty much ever since Dr. Reiswick was appointed, I think, by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| And John, you correct me, I know we meet weekly, we meet on a pretty regular schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7034)|
| 1:57:19| and we've had the conversations about, and I've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| John, these need to be your decisions because you're going to be here and I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| So we've had those kind of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| It seems to me that it would be reasonable to expect that the two of you have this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| before this board has this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| I think I would prefer to have a recommendation from the two of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7060)|
| 1:57:48| rather than us trying to second guess each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| I think that's very unfair, especially to just suddenly throw it out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| when you were not necessarily expecting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7078)|
| 1:58:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| I have whatever we agree on, but I respectfully disagree with that notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| because we are the board, we direct them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| So while we do want them to be the best employees that we possibly have, we're in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| And so we feel as a board that that is the best for, if that decision is best for the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| then those are the decisions that we have to make and, I mean, respect their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7112)|
| 1:58:38| They're great men, but they're our employees and we're the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| And I wanted to say that because we have many conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| and I'm always confused as who's in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| Like they run the system, but this board is in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7129)|
| 1:58:56| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| I'd just like to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| The feeling that I'm having is that this is coming from people who haven't seen how that hiring process works as much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7142)|
| 1:59:10| who haven't been involved in it as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| It's a fluid process that goes on all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| So the idea, I'm really confused about how there is any kind of idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7157)|
| 1:59:25| that they are not constantly working on this together already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| I don't understand that because that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| That's what they do all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| So it doesn't make sense to me that we are looking at this from a perspective that sounds to me like it needs to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7177)|
| 1:59:46| because they are unable to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| It's what they do all day, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7189)|
| 1:59:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| I agree with the sentiments of both Ms. Satterfield and Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| I think we are in charge and we need to kind of set that tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| I do think there is some wisdom in, if this is something that we even want to entertain as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| and I think we can get a feeling for that at this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| for Superintendent Thomas and Dr. Ryswyk to meet between now and Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| and come with some recommendation that would include the pros and cons of moving forward now versus later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7225)|
| 2:00:37| I'm certain that you all understand the implications of this decision way better than any of us do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| in terms of the things that would have to shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| I think there is probably some wisdom in you all coming to the meeting on Wednesday and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7246)|
| 2:00:52| all right, as we have noodled it out, as we have kind of teased it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| here are the benefits of doing this now versus here are the benefits of doing it later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| to empower the board with some more information to be able to make a really informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7261)|
| 2:01:08| I think I would be open to that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| I do still have specific questions about the contract, but I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| I think Ms. Horns is probably about the larger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| Well, first of all, Ms. Owen, I spoke with Superintendent Thomas this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7282)|
| 2:01:27| just so that he could know what my thoughts were before coming into this board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| So that wasn't a surprise to him that I would like to see this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7292)|
| 2:01:39| I think that, I think we, I don't think it's fair to a new superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7299)|
| 2:01:46| to have to make plans with the current superintendent for the following school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7306)|
| 2:01:55| You know, I don't, I think that, I think that Dr. Reiswick may have a difference of opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7315)|
| 2:02:02| on the way something is currently being done, that he may want to make some sort of change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| and I don't feel like that's fair to put him in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| And as Ms. Satterfield said, I'm not sure that it's fair to ask the two to come up with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| of how they want to do things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| I just don't think that that's wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| And I think that we are, we have to be careful of putting people in a position where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7346)|
| 2:02:33| where there, you know, there's any kind of ambiguity about who is, who the superintendent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| And I feel like that's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| Ms. Horn, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| Let me correct what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| My intent is not for them to make a plan together for the future and come telling us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| I think it's important for them to be ready to help us further understand the implications of any decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| based upon start time for Dr. Reiswick in that role at Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| So that's really what I'm after is, if this decision gets made, what's the ripple effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7387)|
| 2:03:12| Not how you guys are going to, you know, plan together over the next few months and all that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| but what are the implications of the decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| Because I don't want to, I don't want us to make the decision either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| and then look back and say, oh, there were some unintended consequences that we didn't really think through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| So that's what I'm asking for assistance on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| is helping us think through what those unintended consequences may or may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| And there may not be many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| Again, I think there's some wisdom in us having this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| I just want to make sure that, again, we don't wake up in three or four months and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| oh, man, that kind of hurt because we didn't realize that was going to happen as a result of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7422)|
| 2:03:52| So are there any more comments or questions about that one item of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7432)|
| 2:04:00| Mr. Watson, you said you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| I do just have a few questions about the contract itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| And Madam Chair and Mr. Dupler, thank you for helping to negotiate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7445)|
| 2:04:10| I understand that you guys helped do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| A point of clarification on item four around compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| So I know in our conversations through the planning process and the hiring process, we set a base at $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7456)|
| 2:04:25| And I think there's a lot of wisdom in the additional compensation that can be added based on performance objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7465)|
| 2:04:33| I like that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| I just want to make sure that we're honoring our original commitment by not setting that original number to $250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| because that's what we had said in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| I just want to make sure that the way we're doing that is clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| and doesn't go against what we were saying throughout the hiring process when we put out the hiring package for superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7485)|
| 2:04:53| And that was Dr. Ryslick's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| He came up with the $240,000, which I think I did remind him that we had put $250,000 in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7498)|
| 2:05:08| Dr. Ryslick, did you want to speak to that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| I do appreciate that, but I do feel like accountability is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7515)|
| 2:05:21| It is for everybody in the district, and it should be important for me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| I think in the same way, I'm somebody who wants to move the needle in the directions that I said during the interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7526)|
| 2:05:32| and I felt like that was a way to be able to get that into a contract to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7532)|
| 2:05:39| I didn't want to go above that, and I felt like the best way to do it is to earn the other $10,000 by leading the district well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| and doing well for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| That's good. I appreciate that approach, and I appreciate it more knowing that it came from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| Certainly, I love the fact that you didn't say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| hey, let's start at $250,000 and add in another $20,000 if I do really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| I appreciate the strategy and backing off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| I just want to make sure, since we stated that in the hiring process, that everybody was—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| I wouldn't have felt right voting on it unless I knew where you stood on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| Then around Section 7, performance goals and standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| I think there's some language that might need to be cleaned up just a little bit in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| It says, no later than October 1st of each year during the term of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| the director shall develop an annual, and then in parentheses, strategy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| I think there's some confusion of words there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| Strategy plan is typically longer range, and then you have annual action plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| I would appreciate a little bit more clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| because I want to make sure that the district doesn't think we're developing a new strategic plan every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7600)|
| 2:06:46| I would remove the word strategy and put annual action plan there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| I don't know if anybody has any feedback on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| Also, I'm curious about—it says the plan consisting of a specific set of 10 to 15 measurable objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7614)|
| 2:07:00| I'm curious the reason behind that particular number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| It seems a little bit arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| Then the last point in that section is the next line says the joint strategic vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| and that's where I would use the word plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| We have a vision, we have a mission, but we also have a strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| and I think what we're talking about there is the joint strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| It's aligned to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| I just think maybe some word modifications might help that be a little bit cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7644)|
| 2:07:31| I don't know if this came from an old template, or I don't know where the language came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| This came out of, obviously, discussions with Dr. Ryswyk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| I believe this came from a TOS template, and he can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| He's nodding his head, so that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| Should the board desire, I can certainly do what Mr. Watson is suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7675)|
| 2:08:00| and change the language a bit, but still keep the same meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| Yeah, I like the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Some people may say it's semantics, but as a person that does some strategic planning and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| I think it's important to be specific about exactly what we mean there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| Unless there's objection, I'd appreciate maybe that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| You said it came from a template from TOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| Did the 10 to 15 number come from TOS, or was that something that you were thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7704)|
| 2:08:29| Dr. Ryswyk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| This really came out of thinking through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| I've had the pleasure of serving under multiple superintendents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| and I've seen the same thing happen every time on the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| It didn't matter whom and previous superintendents were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| You build a strategic plan out with all these metrics, and after the second year, it's no good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| That's either because standards change, COVID hits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| All these kinds of things happen, which throw everything off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| The thought was that if we build it off of a strategic plan, it doesn't change what we're trying to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7735)|
| 2:09:02| But in a given year, like coming off COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| there may have been things we elevated to that to say these are the ones that we want to write into the 10,000 for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| Yeah, I think any strategic plan needs to be a living document, and I love the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| And we've said that several times as this board, but I think your initiative to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| hey, but we also need to work off an annual action plan that adjusts pretty nimbly I think is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| and I appreciate that being a part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| So then my last question is around Section 8, which is a performance evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| I know that the search committee was tasked with re-evaluating our performance evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7774)|
| 2:09:40| and I just want to make sure that there's nothing in this that would limit them in re-evaluating that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| because I'm assuming that work is still in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| I don't know. Maybe it's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| But I know this reference is like a self-appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| and I could see where that may or may not be something that's suggested as a part of a formal evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| So can we get an update on where we are in that process because it's spoken to in the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7800)|
| 2:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| And I can speak to this just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| I know Dr. Ryslick and I had a conversation, and even when I came on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| it was really frustrating to do that about the superintendent evaluation every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| and that's no fault of anyone's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| It's just things change or, you know, things go wrong with testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7827)|
| 2:10:32| or we don't have, you know, the things we need or that we have put in that evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7832)|
| 2:10:39| And you have new board members come on as well, you know, different priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| And, you know, this discussion, and what I liked about, and this was his proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7844)|
| 2:10:51| what I liked about this is that, you know, the board can talk each year on what the priorities should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7851)|
| 2:11:00| and hopefully we would know what metrics we would have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| when we were having that discussion because we might have different metrics next year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| depending on how that all plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| That way you're not just married to that one set of metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| And if you don't have them, well, that's too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| You just, I guess you just can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| So this was, to me, this seemed like it would be, there would be more accountability built in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7883)|
| 2:11:30| and it would be accountability to the sitting board members rather than adopting one for five years out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7890)|
| 2:11:38| or I don't know if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| That helps me, and it helps clarify, and there's a, I'm trying to remember what point it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7901)|
| 2:11:46| I think it's under letter B, under that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| There is the line that talks about the board and the director will endeavor to agree upon the evaluation format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7910)|
| 2:11:57| So I think because of that, it still leaves some possibility for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7917)|
| 2:12:03| the nuts and bolts of the process to fluctuate some and isn't limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| But I want to make sure that I'm understanding that correctly, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| and if there is an update around just the performance evaluation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| especially in light of us possibly considering advancing Dr. Reiser's contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| it would be good to know kind of where that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| because I know we had talked about wanting to have that in place prior to the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| I think is what we had said, but maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| I know that Dr. Grissom reached out to me last week, like midweek or toward the end of the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7951)|
| 2:12:37| and that was after we had already done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| So I told her we would, you know, that's, it's been less than a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| and I told her we'd get back to her after we had this discussion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| because I thought it might be helpful to know how this was going to go before we engage them in a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7969)|
| 2:12:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| If that may, I mean, they need to know what direction they want to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| So I, with the discussion being tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| So then, Mr. Dupler, is this, do you see this section as helping to inform the work of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7987)|
| 2:13:14| or do you see this in any way tying their hands in terms of possibilities, the way this is worded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=7994)|
| 2:13:25| Mr. Watson, I think this is general enough that it certainly does not hinder anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=8005)|
| 2:13:32| and that's why we put in there specifically references to not only the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| but to board policy and to the TDOE regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| So I don't think it hinders anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220404?start=8021)|
