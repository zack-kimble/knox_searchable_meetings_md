| 0:00:10| if Ms. Burroughs is watching from her hospital room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10)|
| 0:00:13| she's our vice chair, let's all wave to Ms. Burroughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13)|
| 0:00:15| and hope a speedy recovery to Ms. Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15)|
| 0:00:18| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18)|
| 0:00:19| So hope that goes all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19)|
| 0:00:21| What we wanted to do today was just go over a couple items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21)|
| 0:00:24| and the law department had some things that they wanted to bring to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=24)|
| 0:00:27| and a lot of people had some items that they wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=27)|
| 0:00:31| So we're just going to go down the list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=31)|
| 0:00:34| We've had an agenda prepared here, and we're just going to go through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| And keep in mind, as we call on everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| we have quite a few people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=41)|
| 0:00:43| Joe, about how much time do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=43)|
| 0:00:45| You said last night you weren't going to take very much at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| but, I mean, take as much as you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| That's really up to the board, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| What I was going to do is give you an idea of where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| where we'll legally need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| All the items on your agenda are actually legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| I'll cover those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=60)|
| 0:01:02| So I can do it in 20 minutes, longer or shorter, as we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| UK, we've got you first on the agenda on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| Did you want to â€“ you and the other departments want to go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| or do you want to yield to the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| It does not matter to me at all, whichever way this body wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| The law department will go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Good afternoon, Mr. Lockhart, our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| Good to see you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Commissioner, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| It's good to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Well, then, we'll let you all go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| Mr. Lockhart, are you going to do this, or is Joe going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| I came down here for one purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| That was to introduce this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Very briefly, but I hadn't had the opportunity enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| I don't know if the podium gives your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Now, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| Members of the Board, it's my pleasure to introduce you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| I know most of you know him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| but I want to take the opportunity to speak about this man publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=125)|
| 0:02:13| I've shared this with most of you and many others in private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| Joe Jarrett, who is the chief deputy law director for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| has distinguished himself in every venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| and effort in which he has been engaged since he was a young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| He was in the United States Air Force, rose rapidly through the ranks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| served in Europe, left the Air Force, completed his education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| He holds not only a law degree but a master's in public administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| He then reentered the military in the United States Army,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| attended Armored Cavalry School in Fort Knox, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| where he graduated first in his class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| was given a chance to choose where he would serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| and he said that he wanted to go back to Western Europe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| where he was a tank commander on the border facing the Russians in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| He left military service as a captain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| attended law school at Stetson University in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| He served as assistant law director in Manatee County, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| and he was the law director in Polk County, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| where he served very honorably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| In fact, they were extremely disappointed when he announced that he would not be staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| He came here with his wife, Mandy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| who's also an attorney, by the way, who he met in law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| He has published over 80 articles on local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| and Knox County is very fortunate to have Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Okay. Thank you for the introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| Well, it can only go downhill from there, so I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| In a nutshell, members of the board, Mr. Chairman, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| I want to give you a brief update as to the law surrounding the Beer Laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| which basically gives us an idea of what our duties and responsibilities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| and likewise our power and authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| Of course, you know you've got your Knox County team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| Let me ask you, do you have a handout that you're going to pass out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| or do you want us to take notes as we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| What do you want us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Well, really, this is just to give you a brief overview of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Ultimately, what I will give out to the board is a proposed change to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| that you'll want to review at your leisure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| It's not something you'd want to make a decision on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| I'm going to switch seats to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| You may want to switch where we can watch the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Jolie, can those not come up on the smaller screens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| I think we can get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Now that our technical expert is ready to roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=291)|
| 0:05:02| If anyone, of course, wants a copy of the PowerPoint, I can provide that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| Generally, because we're just going over some of the basics that are more fully outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| in the handout you'll ultimately get, I didn't make copies of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=310)|
| 0:05:20| What do you think, Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| You think you can get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| We're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| As you're aware, you've got your Nock County team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| You've got U.K. Minot, your Code Enforcement Beer Inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| You've got Leanne Brummett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| Likewise, Alan Wolf, both with the Sheriff's Department, Kim Ellis, and Angie Nesbitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| So you've got a good team in place, both of the field investigators and support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| which assists you in these endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| Basic definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| You have to distinguish between alcoholic beverages and beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Now, that seems like a common-sense standard, but under the bounds of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| they're very distinctive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Alcoholic beverage, basically, you're talking about things other than beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| You're talking about what we commonly refer to as hard liquor, alcohol, spirits, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| whereas beer is defined as ultimately something less than 5% by weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| And this becomes important in terms of essentially what our duties and responsibilities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| especially as this body of law continues to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| It has a lot of interest in the legislature and the General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| and it continues to be an evolving body of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| In a nutshell, you've got the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission, TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| They're the regulatory agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| We're subservient to them as a political subdivision of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| They are the ones who issue the regulations, issue the rulemaking procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| They're the ones who can either broaden or lessen our powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| especially when it comes to liquor permits, server permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| and special occasion licenses for special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| Again, real briefly, there is local options, counties having the ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| inherent ability to permit the manufacture of alcoholic beverages and beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| especially in terms of microbreweries, trafficking, intoxicating liquors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| It sounds ominous, but basically the sale or package dealings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| And likewise, we are empowered to issue beer permits both on and off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| The changes in the law do not preclude us from doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| We retain that power and authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| The Alcoholic Beverage Commission deals with alcoholic beverages, again, other than beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| We can limit the location, a number of retail liquor stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| and we can impose reasonable residency requirements on applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| Of course, if there's a seven-year continuous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| then the state's going to do a preemptive strike on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| So again, just to give you an idea, the state has broad regulatory powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| and authority, especially when it comes to intoxicating liquors other than beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| Joe, may I ask a question at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Well, the liquor referendum, that was going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| You're going to explain that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| I am indeed, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| As you know, we recently, the voters of Knox County, enacted a liquor referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| otherwise known colloquially as Liquor by the Glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| This is a state law that permits local referenda for Liquor by the Glass sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| It's exclusively administered by the state and enforced by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| and they're the ones who likewise will set the taxes and fee for Liquor by the Glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| So this is essentially, although it is now permitted in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| it is licensed and regulated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| What is our role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Ultimately, the only role we have when it comes to Liquor by the Glass intoxicating liquors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| is when we're dealing with a private club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| Whether it's a moose club, elk's club, social club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| In the event a local club wants to sell beer, other than, again, an established restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| if it's a club, the distinction there is they have one further procedural step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| and that is to go to the county and ask for a certificate of good moral character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| That is the county's responsibility to issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| So in capsule summary, if you're dealing with an established restaurant, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| that is non-private in nature, a public entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| I say public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| In other words, a restaurant open to the general public like an Aubrey's or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| Their Liquor by the Glass regulatory issues are handled exclusively by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| If we have a local club like the moose club, they likewise apply to the state for this licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| However, they come to us for the certificate of good moral standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Joe, with regards to something like a theater club that serves dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| I'm thinking maybe they do a play or something and they want to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Would that come under the club designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Generally it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Again, they're going to have to apply to the state, and the state may make a determination one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| They may deem them in a different category and then preclude them from coming to us for the certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| or they may tell them, go get your certificate from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| and we're currently drafting what we feel will be the certificate in accordance with Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| What about now when we say a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Let's say that you have a deli, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| Can they apply to Nashville to get a liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Now that the referendum has passed, they may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| So anything that serves food and serves beer could also serve theoretically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| If they apply and are accepted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| In terms of beer permits, no changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| I know one of the things or concerns on your agenda was who issues them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| People make application, they come before the beer board, and you rule on those permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| Again, you know we have the requirement in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| That won't change for beverage server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| Those programs are ultimately under the state auspices but have been trickled down to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| where we will send them to a server class that the sheriff has certified as being appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| But, again, this ultimately started with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| but you retain your full power and authority relative to the issuance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| or revocation or finding of beer licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Joe, before you get too far gone, you were talking about the liquor by the glass there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| Can you go back, and you may not know this, but I'd say you probably do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| what did it address and what did it not address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| I've heard a lot of people saying, well, now it's going to open up this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| I mean, what exactly did that referendum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| You might want to speak on that for what exactly passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| The legislative intent behind the law as passed is that now established entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| such as restaurants, et cetera, may apply to the state for the ability to serve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| In other words, intoxicating liquors other than beer by the glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| It's a state process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| They apply to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| The state is the one that does an investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| and ultimately determines whether or not that license is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| But it does not pertain to package stores opening up in the outlying areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| No, that's not the intent in the spirit of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Because I've had a lot of questions, and I just want to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| I know a lot of people are watching on TV, and I just wanted to pass that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Joe, what about catering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| If you have a caterer, can they get a license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Let's say they're going to do a party or an event out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Can caterers apply for a liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| They can apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| As to whether or not the state would issue that is questionable at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| The law is somewhat vague, and they retain all regulatory authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| And it appears, from what I can tell from the legislative history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| they're going to do that on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| Would that not be considered like the beer permit, a temporary permit for a caterer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=762)|
| 0:12:51| It very well could be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| One event deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Yes, it could be viewed as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| But, again, although we can issue special or temporary permits for beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| the state reserves the right to issue those for intoxicating liquors, anything other than beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=780)|
| 0:13:07| Another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Joe, following up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| I was under the impression that if I did a private party and hired a bartender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| that that bartender was, in fact, had already been trained by whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| that I got some protection in terms of my guests getting over-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| In other words, he was supposed to treat this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Is that not the way this works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| I mean, do I have any protection as a president if I hire a bartender that is licensed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| Well, if you hire a bartender, certainly you could make the argument that you have a level of protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| that you can basically transfer the risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| But, again, if you are a private homeowner throwing a private party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| there is the possibility that if someone is over-served or a minor is served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| you still can incur some liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| So I think it would be dangerous to presume that by merely hiring a licensed, say, bartender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| who's been certified as a server, that you've just divested yourself of any responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| So it's still, I mean, again, that's beyond the scope of what this board would worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| But as a citizen, they'd be duly cautioned, I think, to go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| And, Joe, one last question, too, is I know it passed on about when does it actually go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| It's going to affect next for the people at home watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| When does this go into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| I'd have to look at the language of the ballot question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| It was my understanding it was January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| That's what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| But we can certainly get that information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| In terms of your duties for a beer permit application, just real quickly, you know there's the morals clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| no sale to minors, convicted owners, mandatory disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Again, these are the things that we require now, and we'll continue to require no changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=895)|
| 0:15:07| I have a little glitch here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Let me see if we can get rid of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=908)|
| 0:15:19| I'm having trouble with your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=919)|
| 0:15:27| Hours of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| As you know, there's a disparity between hours of sale between the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| Those are your current hours per the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| We're not recommending any changes there, nor is the board intimated they wanted us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| And as you know, the city, you can see the distinction between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| It's my understanding a while back the Knox County Commission did in fact pass a resolution seeking some kind of parity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=944)|
| 0:15:54| but that at this point has not occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Did you need to step in, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| I'm Greg Lambert, 7001 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| For my five minutes, one thing I'd like to say is back when I was on the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| I was one of the ones who championed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| I don't think that the rules as they are on when beer can be sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| I don't think we're stopping anybody from drinking beer at certain hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| You know, if they can't buy it in the county, they can go up the street and get it in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| I think that one of the problems that we have with the inconsistencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| with the city being one way and the county being another way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| is that it makes it very difficult for the convenience store industry to train their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| Mr. Weigel, one of my constituents that owns Weigel's Farm Stores, he has a lot of difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| If he trains someone in a county store and then they move to a city store or vice versa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| it creates a problem because the rules are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| I can't see any problem for the county if we made air ordinances the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| but I do see a tremendous benefit for folks that do business in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| And again, I know I'm no longer on the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| but that's something I'd like for you all to undertake is making air rules the same as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| I've talked to Councilman Hall, who's the chairman of the city beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| He didn't seem to be too interested in making the cities the same as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| But again, I don't see that any set of rules is superior to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| I just think that we need to be on the same page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| and I think it would be a tremendous benefit to the folks that are doing business in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| So I just wanted to address you today and say that I hope you all will consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| for the folks that have to train folks to live under these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| Thank you, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| We're pretty much on the same page with you on that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Commissioner Hanlon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| I wanted to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Could the city and the county law enforcement maybe give us some data as to DUIs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| say between three and eight, five and eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| I mean, I know that you have people who are out and a lot of clubs are open until three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| Most last calls are three o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| and most of your alcohol-related fatalities will be between two and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| And I don't think the discrepancy of eight o'clock and ten o'clock is going to keep anybody from getting killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| And I think, unfortunately, that if somebody's going to abuse that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| if they're going to be drunk at eight, they're going to be drunk at ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| And so I don't think that there are statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| I know that the police department does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| I'm sure the sheriff's office also has their fatality statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| but its last call is when all your DUIs and fatalities generally occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| Because the city is just two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| They're just saying, except for Sundays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| they're saying that the rest of the week between three and five you can't sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| but you can sell it at 5.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| So if somebody really wants to get a six-pack, they'll just hang out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| So I'm in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| I don't know that extending the hours a couple hours is really going to make that much of a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| Now, as you're aware, we've talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| but we draw a distinction between what's known as a responsible vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| and someone not falling under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| These are your current regulations for a nonresponsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| It doesn't meet the criteria I'll go into real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| These are what you've traditionally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| You've got a first offense, your second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| and, as you know, it gets progressively increased in terms of severity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| third and then fourth, and ultimately your fifth offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Again, this gives you an idea of what you've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| That hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| However, what has changed is the enactment of the Tennessee Responsible Vendor Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| Now, the way that normally worked is prior to this law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| as a body politic in terms of a beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| your power and authority was to revoke or suspend any permit issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| If now a person comes under the Responsible Vendor Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| your authority in that area is narrowed just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| The ultimate goal of the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| and the legislative history reviewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| basically they wanted to have a voluntary program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| that would encourage vendors to, in fact, be responsible, as the term implies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| and ultimately to, although allow our inspectors to continue to enforce the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| albeit have a different standard for those vendors who we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| are more responsible citizens within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| Their ultimate goal was to eliminate sale of beer for off-premise consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| reduce intoxication and accidents, encourage prudent sale of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| reduce sanctions on vendors, and again, have a uniform statewide law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| What they found is basically a hodgepodge or crazy quilt of laws across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| They were looking for some uniformity and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| trying to find a way to bring vendors under an umbrella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| providing them some protections in exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| for being more responsible to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Finbar, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Joe, back to the list of progressively more fines and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| We don't have to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| If there's something extraordinary, we could revoke a license on stage one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| or three or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| We don't have to go all the way through all six stages, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| If you're dealing with someone who is a non-responsible vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| then you can revoke that license right off the bat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| and offer them a fine and a fine up to $2,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| if they're a non-responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| That doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Your graduated scale is a courtesy that you need not follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| if you have a blatant violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| Again, with the change, the Responsible Vendor Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| again, these are things that the legislature requires, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| in exchange for them being more responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| you're limited in terms of their revocation and suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| So a Responsible Vendor who comes under the act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| who actually applies to the state and becomes so designated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| for a first offense, the board would not be permitted to revoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| or suspend the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| That's the best you can do in a first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| Second offense, then the TABC, the Tennessee Alcohol Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| will ultimately revoke that licensure, and as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| ultimately they'll treat them like they were never certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| So that is the big distinction that the legislature has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| the biggest change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Again, to answer Commissioner Saunders' question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| if you've got a non-responsible vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| you can revoke or suspend that license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| or you can offer a fine of $2,500 for a sale to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| or $1,000 for other offenses, or you can do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| This just gives you a little thumbnail sketch of how the law has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| and again, the only change would be relative to a Responsible Vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1386)|
| 0:23:15| Joe, pardon me, we have revoked, or not revoked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| but we have suspended some licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Now, when that happens, it goes into effect immediately, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| So, in other words, at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| UK and his folks will go out to the establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| and actually padlock the beer case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Is that how it works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| I'm not aware of their enforcement mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| but essentially that license is revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| Whether or not they physically do that, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| but if they are then caught having violated that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| then the penalties are severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| But I believe that has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Joe, in Knox County, how many Responsible Vendors do we actually have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| How many have applied for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| I am not aware of those statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| UK, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| I think it's quite few and far between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| The answer appears to be two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| I did contact the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| I wasn't able to get through to get a definitive answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| I've been notified Rocky Top is the only outfit in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| Well, we know the numbers between one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| As you can see, it hasn't caught on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| and it doesn't appear to be a big selling point at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| However, beyond the Responsible Vendor Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| the changes in the bill do require greater cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| and communication between the board or its designee and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| The state wants to be kept aware of any violations that we file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| and they want to know if we, in fact, try to move against a Responsible Vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| If we think there's a violation, they want to report it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| Bottom line, in terms of proposals in the draft amended ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| building on existing beer laws and complying with the Responsible Vendor Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| again, it won't be a big challenge right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| We only have possibly one or two takers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| Establish a procedure for delinquent businesses if you want to be more proactive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| In other words, you've got a vendor that's a known entity that's usually responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| They let their server training lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| How do you want to handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| You can consider fine increases up to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| And again, increasing communication between the beer board and the TABC is now required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| You can have a spokesperson do that, a designee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Really, they're looking at compiling statistics and monitoring that, which we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| And I'll stand for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| And also, any of our inspectors out there, if you all have any input that you want to let us know at this time, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| we'll be fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| And I'll be passing out to you a draft of the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1561)|
| 0:26:17| Katherine Brunson with the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| I think most of you, I have set out some little one pages that kind of show the results from our underage drinking efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1579)|
| 0:26:28| for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| And I'm very pleased to show you that we have dramatically reduced those numbers over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| This is not something that the Metropolitan Drug Commission has done in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| Mostly it has been done by working on access and availability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| working very closely with both the city and the county, the law enforcement and the beer boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| By reducing access and availability, that's really how we've impacted our underage drinking numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| In 2006, we actually got a national award in collaboration with our city for our underage drinking efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1618)|
| 0:27:08| by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| We were commended for our efforts on rigorous compliance as well as the sanctioning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1631)|
| 0:27:19| I really just want to encourage us to stay with the same due diligence that we've been using for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| to take time with each case that each one needs to be considered on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| I think one of the key questions to ask someone who is offended is not so much how this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| because we already know the answer, they've miscalculated, as Commissioner Norman pointed out to us many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| I think the better question might be, what is it you plan to do to make sure that this doesn't happen in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1666)|
| 0:27:55| And I think that's a critical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| If it requires nothing more for them to have to really put some thought into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| In the city of Knoxville, they're required to submit what's called a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| where they have to think about it and submit in writing prior to their hearing date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| and then they have to testify about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| I would encourage you to consider the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| I think it's very important that we send the right message to our restaurants and our retailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| that we are serious, that this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| One of the reasons I'm really concerned right now is if you read the paper on Thursday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| the city of Knoxville, the police department conducted 41 compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| 21% of the restaurants that were checked failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Or 50%, excuse me, 20 out of the 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| That's really going in the wrong direction from where we've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| In 2006, we had an overall compliance between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| We were a little over 85%, which is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Right now, we're getting ready to hit below 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| And that's not something I want us to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| So I just want to encourage you to use the same due diligence that you've been using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| to send the right message to retailers and restaurants that this is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| and this is not an issue we take lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| And it will go a long way in keeping our underage drinking numbers coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Catherine, in the city, what was the biggest violation that they had of those 41?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| Well, they were all sales to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| There was kind of half split on whether or not they checked the ID and whether they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| But about 50% checked the ID and sold anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| We actually are having on the city beer board tomorrow night a large discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| about the new direction of our numbers, not really liking where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| In the past, the Metropolitan Drug Commission has convened a meeting of the beer bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| sessions, court judges, the prosecutors, and law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| And Commissioner Hammond's suggestion, which I think would be a good one again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| is to bring in the restaurant and retailer folks and for us to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| We know that business owners don't want to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| This is not something they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| And in the past have been able to provide us with some good strategies for how we could assist them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| which is really what we all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| So, you know, I will put that out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| We'll be discussing it in the city tomorrow if you would be willing to convene a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| where we can all speak together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| I don't think it's good to rush into decisions on how we impact things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| without having all parties at the table for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| I'd be happy to assist with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Thank you, Catherine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| In your opinion, are we on track as far as the way we address penalties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| I'm wondering if we're too light, 500, whatever, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Everybody says, well, we'll take the 500 and then they'll go sell their beer, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| And so I'm wondering if the penalty phase might need to be a little bit more harsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| maybe 1,000 on the front end, and that gets their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Does the city handle it in a similar way to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Actually, the city charges less than you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| However, many, many times in the last couple of years, they pretty much pull them at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| Three offenses, it's pretty much done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| There were two instances in the past year where they pulled at the second offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| because it was particularly grievous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| I think it's the rigorousness with how you do it that makes a lot of impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| There is research that's out through the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| that ties very directly the cost, and the cost can be more than money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| but very directly with the improvement in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| And so there is research that that's very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| I mean, it gets their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| That's a good point, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| I don't know, Joe, had you thought about that too, increasing the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| That's why I mentioned the fact that, in fact, Commissioner Finbar beat me to the punch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| You can, in fact, with a nonresponsible vendor, you're not limited to the current fee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| I mean, you'd have to change your ordinance, but if you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| then you can start with a fine up to $2,500 for a first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| And just so you know on that issue, you've got a very proactive law enforcement team working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| The folks I mentioned earlier, and we've been meeting together so we don't do this in a vacuum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| and they'll be bringing some cases to you in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| where you're going to probably want to make some of those determinations to go beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| which we normally did simply because, although it may appear just to be an isolated incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| you'll find that there are repetitive problems out there they'll bring to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| So we're looking forward to you hearing those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Joe, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| And here in the near recent past, the basic problem has just been identification of numbers, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1978)|
| 0:33:09| We can't read the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| And so that was my feeling, that maybe if we give them a bigger number, like $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| they might learn their numbers better and then, therefore, be able to exact the law as they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=1997)|
| 0:33:27| And one comment on that, it went into effect July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| It was passed by Senator Burchett, was all licenses starting July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| the date of birth on the license will actually be about a doubling increase in font size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| Now, that will only be as people renew their licenses or as people get new licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| But that should certainly help that problem of not being able to calculate or read the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| We used to call that non-attention to detail in the Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| I mean, it's pretty basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| They're multitasking probably half the time or they're lackadaisical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| One way or the other, these folks aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| Your enforcement team is on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Any other questions for Katherine or Joe before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Do you have some things here as our beer inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Do you have some items that you want to talk about at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| If we're going to have beer laws, we need to update our beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| The book that we put out to all vendors has got starting hours 8 until 3 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2073)|
| 0:34:42| 8 until 3.15 a.m., 12 noon to 3.15 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| We need to update what we're going by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| Yeah, we have to give out the right information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| Well, I had all this made for each one of you to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| and I thought that's what we were going to do, but I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| Well, go ahead and pass them out real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| I left them in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| What you have in the package you were given is a complete update and rewrite of your ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| and that's where you'd find that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| So that's current, and we've worked on that from the beginning since we came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| U.K., have you had a chance to review what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| No, I was just handed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Take a look at that, and if you see anything that needs to be tweaked, then you get back with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| And on certification, I think ours is as good as the city's on certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| The only difference there, they make their people get certified every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| We make ours every three years, but we forgot to put the three years in our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| and I'm having to go by what the state puts out on theirs, and it's five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| and they would like for us to do the same with our alcohol beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2164)|
| 0:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Joe, did you address that in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I hadn't talked to him about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| This is the first I've heard of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| I know we provided that previously, but the bottom line is you'll ultimately be amending your ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| so we'll ensure before you come up with a final draft and that goes to the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| that there won't be any discrepancies and we'll make sure we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| And I'd like to make one more statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I've been doing this since 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| I got the sheriff of the county to go along with the law department on our beer laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| and I'm going to recommend strongly that we change our errors to match the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| and I'll tell you the reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| We've got stores down Kingston Pike starting from the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| Well, the city limits goes to Lovell Road, and we've got a store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| The city's got one right next door to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| If Mr. Weigel wants to, if he has a manager to call in sick and he has to change one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| they don't know our beer laws if they come out of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| So it ought to be uniform from Loudon County to Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| Who do you think has the better hours, the city or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| I think the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Joe, did you have an opinion on that, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| I mean, I see that as a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| I don't see a legal issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| It may be an issue that makes it troubling for enforcement purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| but that's certainly up to the providence of the board if they want to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| I think that's a no-brainer, UK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| I think we most definitely need to be in conformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| UK, while you're up there, do you padlock them if we suspend the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| Commissioner, what I do, if you suspend them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| I go get the license and tell them to put a chain on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| And I have went back and the chain will be on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| and then they set the beer out of the cooler so it's good and hot so they don't buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2300)|
| 0:38:32| How about we put it in there and we confiscate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| More from your office department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Did any other inspectors, do they have anything they want to bring before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| or things that we need to know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Grant, do you have anything you want to address with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| You know, we appreciate what you all do out there in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| I hear nothing but praises about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| I mean, we hear some people complain about I have to do this or that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| but they know darn well that you're doing the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Do any commissioners have anything they want to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| Chairman, I'd just like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| In regard to zoning for this new liquor by the drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| we have to be careful about how we zone some of these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| because under the current zoning, there's no beer where there's residential agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| If it's something surrounded by commercial, a small commercial lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| and we take the ball camp area, for example, that we're going to be looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| if you can border a small commercial strip on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| you could actually have a bar in a neighborhood very close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| So we've got to be careful the way we zone some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| when we think about liquor by the drink now instead of just off-premise beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| Yeah, we will take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Commissioner Brown, do you have anything you want to bring before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Anybody else have any questions that they want to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| We have a question from the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| You're not getting ready to adjourn, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| Do you want to bring that before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| One other item I forgot about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| In July last year, the law department told me to be sure and check all beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| business tax, and state sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| I'll read this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| I found a beer license at Flying J truck stop at 800 Watt Road at Red off and on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2444)|
| 0:40:55| It's a truck stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| They can only sell off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| So the law department told me to bring their license in and stop them from selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2460)|
| 0:41:11| Is that going to come before us, UK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Is that going to come before us next month for the Flying J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| I think I got their clearance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| Didn't you get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| I've been not selling beer since July of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| But the beer board has to issue the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| If we lose one, the city lets them apply with the clerk's office and charges a fee of $67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2499)|
| 0:41:50| But they had to pass an ordinance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| We don't have an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| We have to go by the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| If it's lost, burn up in a fire, you've got to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| So we need to do whatever you all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| If you want to draw an ordinance, if they lose a license or burn up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| Let's put all of it in this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| That will be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| I have a question, Mr. Minut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Over here, Mr. Minut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| You said this was pulled in July of 2007?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2550)|
| 0:42:37| Commissioner, it was July the 20th of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| And they're just now getting it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Well, they had to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| They come to the beer board in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| And I didn't make that beer board because I fell and broke my nose and tore all the tendons out of my shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2573)|
| 0:43:05| I just wonder if there were some extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Were there items that they were supposed to clear up that weren't made clear to them in one stop that they were drug out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2588)|
| 0:43:20| Commissioner, I'm not sure on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| It was, the best I remember, it was pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| I believe the only thing it was pending is fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| They'd been in business down there since 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| And they sent a clearance over today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| It had been cleared by the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Maybe this is a question then for the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| Is this customary that we give them things or you give them things that they can't clear up based on one visit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2636)|
| 0:44:05| Or why has this one taken so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| Well, I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| I'm asking for the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2653)|
| 0:44:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Could you repeat your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| In this particular case, we're talking about the Flying J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| From July of 2007 until now, we're talking 15 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2670)|
| 0:44:37| What took so long to get them in compliance with your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2677)|
| 0:44:46| Sir, can we get your name for the record before you answer this question for our record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Michael Brown, deputy fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Thank you, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| To give you a 100% answer, I would have to pull that file, take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| I do know that there were some issues with open permits, open construction permits with that project or that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2698)|
| 0:45:08| Several of them, I think there was one that pertained to some fuel tank installations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| Typically, we don't issue a certificate of completion on a project until all of the work is completed for that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2715)|
| 0:45:27| But were these found at different times or all at the same time and they were just lax in getting them fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| That's my concern because I've heard this on another case where different things are found every time they keep prolonging them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2734)|
| 0:45:42| and I'm just wondering why these aren't all found the first time around or at least the second time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| Typically, our office does the best that it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| When we get the notification of the agenda for the beer board, our inspector, Charles Widener, he's out ill today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2752)|
| 0:46:04| He'll go out, make an inspection, and provide them with as accurate list as possible for them of items they need to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2764)|
| 0:46:15| before we will give the okay for their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2775)|
| 0:46:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| Sir, before you leave, over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| I'm sorry, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Go ahead. Do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| If we find it on the first inspection, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| But if we keep finding things, I've heard this, like Commissioner Brown has, that we keep finding things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| or we send a different inspector that has something different interpretation of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| We're holding up business, and I don't think it's appropriate for the fire marshal's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| or any other entity within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| We need to be consistent in what we do so that we don't hamper somebody from either opening a business or doing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| The truck stop had an occupancy certificate, so if you could occupy the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| if you can sell gas at the building, I don't think that we should hold them up on selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| if it's something that's got to do with construction of a tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| Do you understand where I'm coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| I believe I understand what you're getting at, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| I just think we need to be consistent and understand that holding up a business over something that's not related to safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2842)|
| 0:47:30| as far as the beer or the occupancy of the building, I think we could be held liable, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2850)|
| 0:47:39| Well, that's typically why we just have for the beer board agenda, we just have one inspector for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| I can see instances where vacations, holidays, sick leave, personal matters may get to where one inspector may go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2868)|
| 0:47:59| and another one may do a follow-up on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| but that's why we have assigned one inspector just for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| I think if he finds violation A on one visit, the business fixes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| Violation B shouldn't come up on the second visit if he didn't catch it on the first visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| I mean, I don't think that's fair to treat a business that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| If you didn't find it the first time, that's your fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Ask them to fix it, but don't hold up their business is kind of the way I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| I don't know if that goes around the room, but that's kind of the way I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| You had a shot to do it, and you missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| Don't hold up their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Just ask them to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| Those are good points, Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| UK, can you come real quick unless anybody has any other questions for the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| He said no, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| UK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| He said he couldn't come quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Going back to what Commissioner Hammond was saying, when you go back and you padlock it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| I don't drink, so I don't know about beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| How long can it stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| How long, if somebody owns a business and you padlock it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| and we talk about these different fines and lengths of time that they could be closed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| how long before that stuff goes bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| Will it stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| How long is it good for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Well, it's been 20 years since I worked at Budweiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| It had a 190-day life shelf on it, so it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| I mean, I just know how long a Diet Coke can last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| You can't keep that very long before it goes bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I didn't want to ruin somebody's product is what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| Well, we could do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| We can get the beer companies to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| They'd be glad to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| I was wondering if that would be an option, too, if they could sell it back to the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| I'm sure it tastes plenty of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| That's been over 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| That's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3001)|

| 0:50:10| In a few moments, we will have a junior member of commission from the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| And what I want to make sure is that we get in place his moving on to the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| and my leaving the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| So I want to make sure we can enter that as an agenda item on the commission meeting upcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| Would that be proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| I think you're supposed to sit beside him for three months until he gets the feel of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3039)|

| 0:58:14| with our finances and also our expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| So I would like to ask that that be added to the agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| I want to take off of Consent 101 and 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| With our new commissioner that we have on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| and Commissioner Armstrong here serving on the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| Commissioner Wright was filling in for that until that seat was filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| so we might want to talk about that at a later point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| and assuming that the 8th District be represented by Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| And intergovernmental also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| On number 905, I would like to request that we discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| At the very end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| I had a citizen call me last night that wants to speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| but he won't be able to get here until about 530 or quarter until 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| And if for some reason we already get there by then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| I just wish we could put that off until he gets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| So are you asking that be removed from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Remove it from consent and then put it at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| If it's for discussion, then put it at the very end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| Are there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| Can I have a motion to withdraw, postpone, and defer everything that's on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3572)|
| 0:59:41| Mr. Chairman, there were some folks in the back who wanted to be heard, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| Could you come up to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3586)|
| 1:00:01| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| My name is Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| I live at 5316 West Beaver Creek Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| and we would like for that to be heard as soon as possible today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| Which one is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| It does concern a lot of Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| and we'd like for it to get on the agenda as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| It's been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Mr. Chairman, we can just take it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| It's been taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| Yeah, and whenever we get to it, we'll get to it within the order of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| Is that all right with Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Yeah, it's all right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| I have a citizen that wants to speak in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| It's a different facility at a different place that has some real issues with the way it's being conducted now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| and that's the only reason I asked that it be put at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| He can't be here until about 530, 530.25 until 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| And he had some very strong feelings about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| That's the reason I pulled that off, because he was going to speak in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| So he is for it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Well, yeah, he's for putting, for changing the way we're doing it now, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| Well, if he was that interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| don't you think that he would have gotten here on time like the rest of us did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| This is not a debate, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| What's your feelings on it, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Well, it may work out fine, because the reason he said that is he looked at the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| It was at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I think it's the way it is now, it's the very last one that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| And that's why he said that, and I just wanted to be certain that we left it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| And that's the only reason I brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| Do you want to move it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| Well, he won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| I guess he could just speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| I mean, he could speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| I mean, we could do it in two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| I'm going on your guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| I'm very sympathetic to what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| I don't have any reason not to move it up, and then we can discuss it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| or he can have his input at the end of the agenda also, I guess, when he shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| If it's okay with everyone, we'll move it up, not at the very beginning, but close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| Just so you all know, he's with you and we're with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| We're just trying to get as many forces here, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| I don't know what side you're for on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Thank you for moving it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=3741)|

| 1:15:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's an honor for me to stand here today as we honor Charles Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| To me he'll always be known as Dean Burchett because that's how I knew him and met him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| when I was a student at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| There were a lot of folks like me who left their hometowns, came to UT Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| and Charlie Burchett became their de facto daddy along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| He had a tough side to him. He was a Marine that served in combat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| Yet, on the other hand, I can tell you he had an absolute heart of gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| And he taught me many lessons in life. When I worked for him, it was a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| And I'll never forget one time I decided to go swimming at the aquatic center at the university campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| And it failed to hit me that it wasn't open at 2 a.m. and had to go before Charlie Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| Of course, I worked for him at that time. He handled it with a lot of grace and class and dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| And I knew without question that I wasn't supposed to go back there again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| and I wasn't supposed to get in any more trouble again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| But the way he handled it left an impression on me that I have never forgotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| and I'll always be grateful for his friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| I used to tease him and Joyce when I would see them out saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| working for Charlie Burchett was the absolute best job I ever had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| and if he could have paid more, I would have stayed there a lot longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| But I think he wanted me to graduate from school and get out and do something on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| I was at the VA nursing home the morning Dean Burchett passed away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| and saw his family there that day and had an opportunity to express my condolences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| But I can tell you this, Knoxville and Knox County, University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| are all finer places because he passed our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| He was a true American patriot. He's someone I admired, respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| and we're lesser today because of his passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| And you don't have to look very far behind me to see a great family in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| And I'm proud to be a part of honoring today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| and I applaud the commission for taking this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| I'd like to say that a lot of us wouldn't have made it through UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| if it hadn't been for Dean Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| He was a man of great integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| I used to love to see him and his wife, how they used to kid each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| His sense of humor was just phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| I can remember when I used to go to the hospital and see him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| one of the last things he told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| Tank, I'm just meditating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| Tim was trying to get him to talk to him and he was kind of out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| and he just said, I'm meditating, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| But anyway, it's an honor for me to be a part of this and to celebrate his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| I truly admire Dean Burchett and, of course, Ms. Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4693)|
| 1:18:23| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4703)|
| 1:18:39| I miss Charles R. Burchett, Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| My name is Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| I just want to thank you all for this honor for Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| Charlie was indeed one of a kind and we loved him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| and we always appreciate hearing all these kind remarks about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| I guess I should introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| This is my wife, Allison, and my sister, Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| And, of course, you all met my mama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| My brother, Charlie, couldn't be here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| but I just wanted to thank Knox County on behalf of the Burchett family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| for allocating the money for the Veterans Nursing Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| That's just a wonderful facility and those people are God's gift to our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| We don't do enough for our veterans, but Knox County really stuck its neck out on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| and they did an excellent job and you ought to be commended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| I know Commissioner Hammond is in Mom and Daddy's Sunday school class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| so you've got a little more work to do on Mama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| She'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| So thank you all so much for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| We appreciate you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4797)|
| 1:20:19| Clerk, if we'll go back to 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| expressed in the sense of the Knox County Commission that the rezoning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| is the proper manner for handling the question of commercial landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| businesses operating on land, agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| and urging the Metropolitan Planning Commission to recognize that both in the abstract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4839)|
| 1:20:47| and in the specific current cases such as Gibbons Landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| Second by Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| I'm just curious how this will affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| I know on the BZA we've asked MPC to look at this, to look at bringing us some new regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4869)|
| 1:21:19| Is this going to affect that in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| What I think that we need to do is I think there needs to now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| whether it should affect this particular site or not, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| But I think there should be a bridge between running a full-blown landscaping business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4890)|
| 1:21:41| with a garden center and not having a landscaping business at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| There should be some middle ground there where a company can store their equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| without getting a full-blown, you know, commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| And I'm wondering, will this affect that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| Because I really think that we need a way to control this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| You know, when a landscaping business comes into a predominantly residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| we need a way to keep it from becoming a full-blown commercial business with street traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| Mark Donaldson, would you like to answer Commissioner Lambert's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| With respect to the request that BZA made, I'm Mark Donaldson, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| Well, we have begun preparing criteria to add landscape service businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4948)|
| 1:22:35| to the Ag Zoning District as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| We have postponed it from our consideration immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| pending a public meeting that we've been working with the Office of Neighborhoods to set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4963)|
| 1:22:51| But the scenario that was laid out by BZA was to add it to the list of uses permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4971)|
| 1:22:59| within the Ag District and to establish criteria for that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| How would this passing affect what you guys are doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| I mean, I think it would be a great idea if it came before the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| in the zoning portion of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| But what I don't want to do, I don't want it to be, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| as it stands now on an agricultural zoning, a person can run a composting and mulching operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| And I think that a mulching operation is far more intrusive than, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| a landscaper that has a truck or two parked in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| And what I want to do is make it to where there can be some middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5016)|
| 1:23:45| Because if a person comes before us and they say, okay, we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| all I'm going to do is park some trucks in the backyard and we rezone it commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| then they can open a full-blown garden center with, you know, commercial traffic coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| And I believe there needs to be some middle way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| I don't believe that, you know, a person should be able to operate a mulching composting facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5045)|
| 1:24:12| yet not be allowed to keep a few pickups parked in their backyard for a landscaping business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| But at the same token, I don't want it to be where if we rezone it that they can just do anything they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| I think you've identified the two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| One, there may be certain circumstances within ag zoning where a landscaping service business would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5070)|
| 1:24:38| and there may be circumstances where it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| The use on review process is that middle ground to take a look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| If we were to add it to a zone district as a permitted use, when you rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5086)|
| 1:24:54| you then bring along with it all of the other permitted uses within that zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| And because of the nature of where these businesses may be operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| you would bring into play the issues of spot zoning and plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| that may not be consistent with the existing plan as it's been written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| For example, even if we looked at the rural commercial zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| as a proper place for a landscaping service business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| the zoning code is fairly specific about the locations where that zone district should be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| It should be applied at crossroads of arterial and collector streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| whereas the requests that we may get may be scattered throughout the balance of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5140)|
| 1:25:48| To address that situation, a use on review would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| If this passes today, will that affect the use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| Here's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| Two of my constituents are out there now that have a landscaping company next door to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| Now, you know, I don't think that they should be completely forced out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| where they're across the street from a driving range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| and just down the street from a water treatment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| But on the same token, if they're allowed to stay there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| it needs to be with some pretty tight controls so that they don't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| they're not a nuisance to their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| And if this passes today, will it affect what you guys are going to do on MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| Well, my read of this resolution is that we ought not to consider use on review as the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| and that we ought to consider it only in terms of rezoning a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| to one of the existing zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Could a zone be created, an agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| Could a landscape zone be created to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| to put in the tight restrictions that we're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| Or is this an all or nothing thing if this passes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| Because that's what I don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| I don't want to pass this thing and then it tie our hands to where we've got a choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| to where we just flat out let them do anything they want to do or we don't let them do it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| If passing this means that we go to an all or nothing situation, then I'm against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| because I don't believe we need an all or nothing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| If someone's going to operate a landscaping business in a residential neighborhood in a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| it needs to be with the tightest of controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| And so if this would tie your hands, you know, to create that middle ground, then I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| However, if this sends a strong message to the MPC that we want any landscaping business to be tightly controlled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5266)|
| 1:27:56| you know, then I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| So I guess will this, if this will, is this, do I hear you saying that this will keep you all from creating this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5277)|
| 1:28:07| use on review and that that's the only way to do some middle ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| Well, my reading of the caption is that, yes, you want to use zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| rezoning as the process to control landscape service businesses, not use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5296)|
| 1:28:24| Now, if you were to amend the resolution and give us more direction, that would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| Mr. Harmon, is there any, is your purpose with this to see that it's heard by the full commission rather than BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5312)|
| 1:28:40| or is your purpose to this to create this all or nothing situation with no middle ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5320)|
| 1:28:47| Of course it's not the latter, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| My purpose is to stop the repeated annoyance to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| And remember, this is a sense of the commission resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| And what it's saying is, yes, you're free to create a new zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| You're free to create an agricultural commercial or some other new type of zone, as you suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| But we should not be using the use on review process to sneak in repeatedly large landscaping businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5356)|
| 1:29:26| of which we've heard at least two, maybe more complaints, each of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| And that's the purpose, is to give MPC some direction here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| Yes, you can create a new zone, but you should not be using the use on review to make life difficult for the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5374)|
| 1:29:42| which is their experience, their unfortunate experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| And let's give the neighbors something to work with by giving them this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| Is that, can you create a new zone with MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| Well, I don't know that we want to create a new zone specific to landscape service businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| The problem with adding it to an existing zone is that you then bring all of the other uses that are allowed by right into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5404)|
| 1:30:15| And you run the risk of having a case where it really makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| but it's off by itself on a large tract of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| and you could be perceived to be doing spot zoning by approving that sort of an arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5425)|
| 1:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| Mr. Harmon, how would you feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| And I'll make this as a substitute motion, if you're in agreement with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| We will get to you in just a moment, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| We've got a couple more lights on, and then I'll let anybody in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| Mark, how would you feel about this, that we change this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| asking MPC to make it to where any use on review for a landscape business be heard by the full commission rather than BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5456)|
| 1:31:06| Would that achieve what you're wanting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| and at the same time give these guys the leeway to do what they need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| Let me correct before we get started there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| A use on review is approved by the planning commission, not by the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5477)|
| 1:31:24| The BZA in that case was hearing an appeal of an administrative decision regarding the classification of that business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5484)|
| 1:31:33| but the use on review process, as it's set up in the zoning ordinance, goes through the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| It's done with a public hearing, full notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| The signs are posted on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| Notices are mailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| Notices are published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| And we conduct a public hearing before considering a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| So every use on review would have an approved development plan that we have reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| and has been approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| If this commission passes something today saying that we would like to have any use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5522)|
| 1:32:11| for a landscaping business ratified by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| do we have the authority to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| I believe you have assigned the authority to review development plans to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| so you could rescind a part of that authority if you're very, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| you would run the risk of politicizing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| and of adding additional burden to a specific business that may not always require that burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5560)|
| 1:32:50| Well, to pretend it's not politicized now is a great pretense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| Let us just make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| My purpose here is to say, if I may be blunt for a second, stop screwing the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| An MPC at use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| The reference that you made in your caption was a request to rezone the property that was denied by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5589)|
| 1:33:19| Unfortunately, through the use on review process, the neighbors are being forever jerked around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| and what we want, of course, is for this not to happen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| So I'd be happy to phrase the resolution more bluntly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| that you need to give greater consideration to neighbor concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| because landscaping businesses tend to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| They tend to bring in employees, and while that's a good thing, it should be in commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| At this point, we haven't approved any landscaping businesses as a use on review because it's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5624)|
| 1:33:53| You know, I'm going to make the substitute motion that we not vote against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5633)|
| 1:34:00| but that we withdraw it and we give MPC the opportunity to come up with their use on review regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5640)|
| 1:34:08| And after we've seen those, if they're bad, we may well want to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| But I think we should give them the opportunity to set up regulations that will not do to the neighbors what you suggested that they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5654)|
| 1:34:26| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Yeah, I just want to, because this constituent that called me, he may have talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Commissioner Lambert, you made a motion to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| I'm making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| Now, if we withdraw it, it can be brought back at any time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Do I have a second to the withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| No, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| Commissioner Briggs, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| This constituent that called me, and he may have spoken either to you or Commissioner Hammond, I'm not certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| but he lives out on Everett Road and it's the same situation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| It started off as sort of a quiet business and then they moved in a large mulcher that was going all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| The dust was coming over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| They were having fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| And it really became a nuisance to the neighbors over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| And I think we really do have to regulate this, whether we need to have a different zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| sort of a commercial agricultural zone, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| But we definitely need to do it because it's not what was intended when a landscaping business moved onto those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5726)|
| 1:35:34| I think people thought it would sort of be a quiet thing where people would maybe store some bushes and trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| but it's become a much bigger operation than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| Commissioner Briggs, at Intergovernmental, I'd ask about the same thing to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| And I asked the question, Mark, if you remember, I asked, does a mulching business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| not just one that sells but processes and makes the mulch, where is that allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| What kind of zoning allows that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| It is currently allowed as a use on review within the agricultural zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| So, I mean, I don't think that necessarily particularly pertains to this right here, does it, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| No, we're talking about a landscape service business that could range in size from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| one guy with a crew in a pickup truck to Kemlon or True Green or a big commercial operation like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5779)|
| 1:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Ma'am, if you will give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| My name is Kathy Atkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| I live at 8408 Strawberry Plains Park, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| Commercial is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| This commission is the safety net that we rely upon to protect our communities and our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5805)|
| 1:36:53| Now, as far as the agriculture zone goes, our farmlands, our residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| there's a very good reason why these landscaping companies, these commercial landscaping companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| have not been allowed in, and that's because there's commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| There's commercial property all over Knox County that's not being used right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| When these companies move into the community, and I'm a good example of that because I have experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| I had one move in across the street from me several years ago, and it moved in as a full commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| He moved in with eight commercial trucks, trailers, earth-moving equipment, employees and trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| Semi started making deliveries, and people showed up to drive the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| The traffic increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| The noise was horrific, and it destroyed the peace of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| This is not an uncommon story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| This happens all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| In my particular case, he came down after about a year and applied for rezoning to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| He was denied rezoning and issued a stop work order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| He never stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| A few months later, he got a cease and desist letter from the Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| He didn't cease and desist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| He kept running the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| He got himself a lawyer and held it off until a year went by, and then almost a year to the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5892)|
| 1:38:19| rezoned again to turn the property into commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| Once again, the MPC saw that it was a bad place for a commercial business, asked what he'd changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| He said nothing, but this time he was represented by an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| They once again said, nope, this is a bad place for a business, and denied him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| Gave him a stop work order, and he never stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| And that went on until Knox County brought a lawsuit against him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| and he settled the day before the lawsuit and agreed to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| I'd like to tell you he stopped, but he just hides what he's doing better now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| There is no way to control commercial landscaping businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| The codes department plate is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| They cannot watch what these businesses are doing in these agriculture and farmland neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| You are the safety net set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| The rezoning process protects the landowner's rights to know what's in the agriculture neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5951)|
| 1:39:18| If it's commercial, it belongs in a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| This is a completely unneeded amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| It got faster two weeks from the BZA in front of the MPC, and nobody knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5965)|
| 1:39:33| They put it off because they said, well, there's public concern because this thing moves so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| And everybody said, oh, this moves so fast, and they put it off again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| This is unneeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| The rezoning process that's in place now is proper and good, and it's fair for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| It's fair for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| It's fair for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| And it's fair for our farmlands and our agriculture neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| Folks, this is all we've got left in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| There's places for these commercial businesses to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| And I would hope that you never had a commercial landscaping business moving next to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| because it will change your peace, it will change your life, your property value will go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6012)|
| 1:40:21| Please don't see this amendment as something we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| This is going to serve a select few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| This is going to give a backdoor in, these landscaping companies that have not been able to get rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| And there's a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| No matter if they went and got fancy lawyers, went for the MPC, no matter what they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| if it was spot zoning, the MPC said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| And that's what most of this is, is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| The MPC staff report that went to them for them to look over said that they had two cases in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| that had moved into Knox County that started out with a little man with a lawnmower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| then he got him a trailer, and then all of a sudden he was a real business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| Well, you know, I can tell you about one of those across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| It didn't come in with a man with a couple of lawnmowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| It came in as a full-fledged commercial business from another location, not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| No home occupation because landscaping cannot get a home occupation because they go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| You've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| Think about what I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Think about the peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Think about your safety net that you are for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| And protect us, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Ma'am, are you in favor of the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| I think that commercial business belongs on commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| and I think that it has to go before the MPC for the MPC to evaluate what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| And if it's a commercial business, then it needs to apply for commercial rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| And that's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| I think this amendment is completely uncalled for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| It will only service the landscaping companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| You know, I listened to Judge Fantzler when he gave the ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| He said, look, we need to change sector plans only when it is beneficial to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| And there's a lot of things that's very beneficial to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| And they do belong in the agriculture zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| But private landscape commercial businesses are not going to profit our community and our farmlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| This is a back door to get under the rezoning process now that a commission cannot receive on appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6146)|
| 1:42:35| from these zoning attorneys that can't get commercial zoning for these landscaping companies that are commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| That's all this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| Mr. Chairman, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| Okay, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| Commissioner Lambert did not get a second for his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| Yes, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| And, ma'am, you know, I just want to, I want you to understand what I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| I'm not trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| Commissioner Lambert, I went down and paid $10 and got a copy of that BZA tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| And I listened how this came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| I listened over and over again trying to figure out who really was in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| And I just heard you over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| In between you giggling at those people that stood up trying to plead for their rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| I still am confused about how this thing came to pass because the staff report that went to the MPC said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| It seemed like the commission felt, even though they didn't say so, that this might be an agriculture use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6207)|
| 1:43:35| Now, I don't know, shouldn't you kind of say what the commission says in a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| Ma'am, we're not going to get personal here, but, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| I mean, ma'am, what I think we need to do and what I'm trying to do here is if they get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| if it stays like it is to where they have to get a rezoning and they come down here and they get it rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6229)|
| 1:43:56| and they get it rezoned commercial, then they have no restrictions whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| That's what the MPC is for, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| They can open a full-blown garden store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| That's what the MPC is for, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| What we're looking for is some middle ground here so that we can control because these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| We can control them because we have the proper rezoning in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| This is a completely unnecessary amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| I'm going to stop it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| I think Mr. Lambert is very upset about the, I think about really the middle sentence of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| I think this could be rewritten to where we could at least have a straight up-down vote on what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| Here's my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| Reads as is, but it says, expressing the sense of Knox County Commission that commercial landscaping businesses should not be operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6285)|
| 1:44:53| agricultural, urging MPC to recognize that proposition boasts in the abstract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| and in specific current cases such as Gibbons Landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| That modification dropping the whole reference to rezoning, I think, would get to the point about whether you support this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| or oppose this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| It would be a wonderful straight up-down vote if procedurally we could get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Commissioner Harmon, could we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| I'm going to do that as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| Well, you can't do that since we already have one substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| Then I'll do it as an amendment to the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| Well, we can't get to that until we get through the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| Which is to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| But I do want to ask you this because what I don't see within your original motion is for MPC to maybe study this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6330)|
| 1:45:39| and come back with the intent that you're trying to get at so that we can amend either our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| or come up with a new ordinance that addresses this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| I think the intent is not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| The intent is to give direction to the MPC that we believe commercial landscaping businesses should not be operating on lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| that are agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| And so when they're doing this review or they're doing any of the other MPC business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| that that proposition that our thinking will be expressed clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| May I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Give me your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| Paula Yarbrough, 5316 West Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| This is in reference to something that Mr. Lambert said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| You know, you talked about someone having maybe one or two vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| In the regulations it does state that now in regulations 5.21.02J states parking of not more than two commercial vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6384)|
| 1:46:34| That covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| It's already covered what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| Well, there needs to be something in the middle to where we can allow limited use without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6397)|
| 1:46:44| Because if we rezone that, and it would be really hard for the gentleman across from next door to you not to get commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6404)|
| 1:46:52| His attorney will come up and argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| And what they'll say is, is we're across the street from a commercial business with commercial traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| We're across the street from a driving range in a barbecue restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| And we're just down the street from the Hallsdale Powell water treatment facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| They would have a very good case to ask for commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| If they got commercial zoning, they could open a full-blown garden center just like Jack Thress has got down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| Now, I'm not in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| I believe that if we allow him to do something in that neighborhood, it should be with very tight controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| I'm not trying to remove controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| I'm trying to make controls tighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| But if we make it all or nothing, your neighbor could make a very good case that he has every right to start a commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6453)|
| 1:47:41| And based on the commercial businesses that surround him, he may have a good shot at getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| What I'm trying to say is, is let's get away from this all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| Either you're a full-blown commercial site that can have a store, and let's allow some limited use with very, very tight controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6470)|
| 1:48:00| The Office of Neighborhoods has said that that's what they were in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| And what I'm trying to do today by withdrawing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| Who determines these controls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Those are to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| The regulations haven't been written yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| What I'm saying is let's back off and let's write the regulations before we decide whether they're good or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| Well, I want to say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Is that I've gotten letters from realtors because I came and I let them come out to give me appraisal on my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| And they both said that what's going on next door has depreciated my property and that I would have a problem selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6521)|
| 1:48:49| I guess the question is, does the original motion or possibly amended with what Commissioner Harmon has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6529)|
| 1:48:59| how does that change what MPC will do as far as the way they look at whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| or not something can be classified as a landscape business and where could that landscape business go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6545)|
| 1:49:12| Will this address your questions or do you need to come back, study it and come back before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6552)|
| 1:49:22| I'm not sure that the wording that Commissioner Harmon offered provides a whole lot of guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| In addition to speaking about rezoning, there was also a discussion about reviewing uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| And what's been discussed up to this point is creating a use on review process for landscape businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6575)|
| 1:49:45| What could happen as a result of some more time would be to look at all of the other zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| where that might be appropriate beyond just the ag district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6590)|
| 1:49:57| We have a rural commercial zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| We have a neighborhood commercial zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| We have a menu of different commercial zone districts, some of which may be appropriate for landscape businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| and some that may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| The agricultural district could be perceived as a commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| The agricultural industry operates within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| And with the current list of uses on review, it is a very long list with a lot of very intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| and active uses listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| So we can review all of that with more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| Mr. Law Director, what would be your suggestion for where we're at now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| and what is the best way to proceed so that we have a clear cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| what can go into what type of zoning with what kind of process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| Currently, the zoning ordinance, as Mr. Donaldson has explained, is pretty clear as far as what exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6652)|
| 1:51:00| In an agricultural zoning, you can't even get a landscaping business with a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6660)|
| 1:51:11| And correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| I thought I understood you to say at the last maybe at the committee that this was currently being studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6674)|
| 1:51:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| We have an initial draft of criteria to consider a use on review within the ag district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6684)|
| 1:51:32| That's been postponed pending working with the Office of Neighborhoods to have a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6692)|
| 1:51:41| What is before this body today is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| We have very carefully thought out zoning ordinances in place passed by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6705)|
| 1:51:55| and before action is taken that might affect the zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6715)|
| 1:52:07| I would caution against doing that until NPC finishes the study that's underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6727)|
| 1:52:17| They will submit those, and this body will have an opportunity to take a look and either accept, reject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6737)|
| 1:52:26| It's going to have to be made in the form of you want to make it in the form of an ordinance anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6746)|
| 1:52:34| Right now, I don't see what the issue is because landscaping is not allowed in an agricultural zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6754)|
| 1:52:44| so the only way it could happen is through the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| What is being looked at is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| NPC will make a recommendation or at least submit something for this body to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| and we should wait until that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| And is that study on the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Are you doing that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| Yes, we have a draft of the proposed criteria to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| And are you taking into consideration what Commissioner Harmon has proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| Is that within your study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| We haven't gone beyond looking at just the ag district at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| If we passed a resolution today asking that you include what Commissioner Harmon is proposing into that study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6808)|
| 1:53:36| Commissioner Harmon, would that satisfy you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| No, because I think we're losing sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| This is simply guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| A resolution is guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| And this is guidance to the NPC saying commercial landscaping businesses should not be operating on land zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6823)|
| 1:53:50| The only thing that's muddled about that is if you want to muddle it in the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| It's quite clear in the speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| So let us simply pass a resolution expressing our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| That will guide them, and that will be an expression that can be clearly understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| That's what I wanted with this, and that's what I hope we can get out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| My question sort of revolves around, though, what is it that we're really looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| In the repeated discussion that I think I've heard, there are problems existing between what is currently authorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6856)|
| 1:54:27| and what neighbors are expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| Correct me if I'm wrong in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| I think it's what they're currently experiencing, not just expecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| but they're experiencing something other than what the zoning is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| Is that not what you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| Sir, if you'd like to speak, if you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| My name is Michael Connery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| I live 5316 West Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| He can't answer my question until I ask it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| The problem that I have with commission right at the moment is I hear people standing in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| complaining about actions that have taken place for a couple of years that are not in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| with existing Knox County rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| What is changing the law got to do with enforcing the law that we've got right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| There's no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| They don't have anybody to come out to enforce it when they don't give somebody 30 days to vacate the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6920)|
| 1:55:28| or they're going to give somebody another 120 days to let them go on a review process to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| Who's being all painful is us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| We're the one that has to put up with the dust, the working of the machinery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| everything that's going on at that time, the tearing up of our roads up and down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| with the big trucks coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| They have patched in front of our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6949)|
| 1:55:50| For just a second now, let me say that he's asking the same question I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| Why would we want to change the law that we're not enforcing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| If the law that they're asking be enforced was enforced, would there be an issue before us right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6958)|
| 1:56:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| You might want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| We have Grant Rosenberg here who's a coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| You might want to ask why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Now then, in the interest of us moving along, we may be at the end of this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| if we say MPC's looking at something and Grant's looking at something and we've deferred or we have the motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6979)|
| 1:56:30| to withdraw so that it could be brought back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| Could I say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| I have seen some of the proposals that they're working up for what they expect to be acceptable for this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=6997)|
| 1:56:44| and you just have to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| I mean, they go into detail talking about how they can have heavy equipment and large trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| and it reads like a horror story to anybody that has ever had any kind of business like this around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7014)|
| 1:57:02| The codes department cannot handle the complaints that they have trying to get these people in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| Now, all this is going to do is going to open up a Pandora's box on Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| That's all this is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| This is making a back door onto our agriculture land for these commercial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7036)|
| 1:57:23| Now, a mulching company is a mulching company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| They don't have a dozen people showing up every day to drive trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| Listen, when you've heard backup noises for three hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| and you're trying to sit out in your yard and have a cup of tea, you know, you can get angry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| This noise goes on for hours and hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| These guidelines that I've seen so far that are not finished yet are horrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7060)|
| 1:57:47| If this goes through, it's absolutely putting commercial industry into the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7067)|
| 1:57:55| That's all it's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| And I do feel like the guidelines have not been followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| My neighbor did receive a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| And from that point on, I think this is what started it was me going up there and making a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| He received his letter and nothing has happened from that point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| He has continued to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| Let's get Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| I'll yield to Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| Grant, are we going out there and enforcing our codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| Yeah, we've been out on both occasions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| In the case of Ms. Atkins, Givens Landscaping, it resulted in a lawsuit from our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| In the case of Ms. Yarbrough, that action actually is pending right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| The reason we haven't taken any enforcement action is that the property owner had appealed our decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| and appealed my decision that it was in violation of ag zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| The Board of Zoning Appeals made a recommendation to MPC, deferred that appeal for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| So we are not going to take action as it's under appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| Grant, if you'll just identify yourself real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| Grant Rosenberg, Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| Grant, I mean you deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| I think it's still Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| You know, Commissioners, I think we've heard quite a bit on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| We've heard from MPC and from Grant and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| And with what David Wright was just telling us, I want to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| We have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| We did have a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| This is only on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| Let's do it by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7170)|

| 1:59:53| Commissioner Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7193)|

| 1:59:57| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7197)|

| 2:00:01| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7206)|

| 2:00:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7224)|
| 2:00:36| Did everyone understand this was just a vote to stop debate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| It was just a vote on the call of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| The call fails 9-8 because it would have taken 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| We had a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| Commissioner Armstrong, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| The real concern that I have at this point is that we have ordinances that are standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| and for some reason our procedures are allowing this thing to continue and continue and continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| upon the citizens of Knox County once they get a ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| And it seems like that we're currently, our hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| And I think we need to look at faster remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| I guess that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| I've got some heartburn over some of these people who have had to put up this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| It seems like years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| And it's on the face of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| If they're violating an ordinance, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| And I guess the law director will have to give us some advice on this to expedite the implementation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| Settling of County Commission in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| And if our law director can help us out, is there any way that we can help these citizens out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| especially on Strawberry Plants Pine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| Enforcement has taken every action that it possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| They recognize the situation that these folks are having to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| Once it goes into the legal process, due process requires that that process work itself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7325)|
| 2:02:13| It's beyond our control what the time limits are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| And if there's an appeal, then that appeal has to proceed until it's concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7338)|
| 2:02:26| So Knox County, in terms of enforcement, has taken the action that it needs to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7346)|
| 2:02:37| and has recognized that this operation is not as it should be and is trying to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7357)|
| 2:02:48| It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| I guess where I'm really coming from, if what I hear is true, we've had cease and desist orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| Was that overruled in this appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| Are they still under cease and desist orders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| And why aren't they ceasing and desisting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| And what can we do if that be the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| That's really where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| I understand the due process requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| Well, a cease and desist order is something that is put on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| But, again, you have appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| And when you tell someone, when you invoke the legal process, then everyone has rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7394)|
| 2:03:23| And when someone has an adverse action taken against them, then they have a right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| And there's time limits, and it has to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| Those are things that are beyond their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| They're beyond our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| It's something that we have to live by, and we push it along as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7418)|
| 2:03:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| But the real sometimes in cases, even under appeal, the cease and desist order can stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| Because my question really, and I guess we just need to read the judgment of the court at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7432)|
| 2:03:58| whether or not even under appeal they can continue to do business if the zoning, in fact, is in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7438)|
| 2:04:05| You know, it can go either way, and I haven't read the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| So they could actually enforce the cease and desist while it's under appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| And if we're not doing that, did the court rule that way or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| I wasn't familiar with the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| And I'll tell you, this is a matter that began before my tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| What is the situation, Grant, in terms of when your office goes out in this particular instance, not generally, but in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7463)|
| 2:04:33| Our office doesn't issue cease and desist letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| We issue a notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| And there's two different cases here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| In the case of Gibbons Landscaping, which is the one on Straw Plains Pike, that went through the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| I think it was settled in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| I don't have the file in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| The issue with Yarboroughs on West Beaver Creek, that was simply a notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| And he had appealed that notice of violation to the Board of Zoning Appeals, and that's where the process stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7496)|
| 2:05:04| The Board of Zoning Appeals made a recommendation to MPC to develop some standards for use under review in an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7504)|
| 2:05:12| We are in the process of developing those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| It came before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| They developed the standards rather quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| We've deferred that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| We're still within the 120 days of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| And ultimately, you know, whatever ordinance change or new zone change that MPC develops would have to come before this body at some point anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7525)|
| 2:05:36| When will the time run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| I'll have to look at the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| It's got another, I think it has until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| We plan on having a meeting hopefully this month, hopefully prior to that January meeting, a meeting with, a public meeting, neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7549)|
| 2:05:58| everyone involved, discuss the merits, pros and cons of whichever route we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7558)|
| 2:06:05| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| Yeah, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| You know, you were involved in that BZA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| Do you see a need for the middle ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| I mean, in the middle ground that I'm talking about is where very strict regulations are put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| I mean, do you see a need for something less than full-blown commercial and something, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7582)|
| 2:06:30| do you see a need for that middle ground that I'm looking for here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| And these two situations are completely different, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| I'm not familiar with your situation out in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| I'm familiar with the one on Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| Mr. Lambert, I think that the middle ground you're looking for is called commercial property for commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7607)|
| 2:06:54| Well, Grant, do you think, let's look at the one on Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| Do you think that should either be full-blown commercial to where they can have a store with traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| or do you believe that it should not be allowed at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| Sir, I've asked Grant, I haven't asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| When I want to ask you something, I'll address you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| Grant, do you see a need for there to be some sort of middle ground there that we've asked MPC to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7639)|
| 2:07:26| or do you think it should be all or nothing commercial or agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| The use on review process allows for that gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| Rezoning to commercial or keeping it as ag as it stands right now is kind of a black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7654)|
| 2:07:41| The use on review allows MPC to regulate the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7661)|
| 2:07:48| Right now there are uses on review existing in the ag ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| For example, Solway, natural resources recovery, that is an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| That was granted a use on review years back, and it's a commercial mulching operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7678)|
| 2:08:04| So you're saying that the Solway facility could get a use on review to operate on this very piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7684)|
| 2:08:14| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| You're saying that the Solway facility could get a use on review to operate on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7695)|
| 2:08:22| but the man can't get a use on review to park a few trucks there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| It could apply for a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| It doesn't mean it's going to be granted a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| It's the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| It's a very similar process to a rezoning with the exception of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| Instead of going to full commission, it goes to the board of zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| That's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| As Mr. Donaldson had said, you know, maybe there's a better route to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7720)|
| 2:08:47| Maybe it's creating a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| Maybe it's using our existing CR zone, which is a commercial rural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| I don't know what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| I mean, I'm charged with enforcing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| I'm trying to, you know, facilitate a meeting this month or next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| Commissioner Lambert, I don't think it's necessarily Grant's job to decide if something deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7743)|
| 2:09:08| Well, I mean, Grant was the one that said to begin with we needed some middle ground here that we didn't need it to where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| I mean, if we rezone this man's property to a full-blown commercial, then it's going to allow all kinds of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| And I do think that this commission should know that the gentleman in question, he was running his landscape facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7760)|
| 2:09:28| and parking his trucks there long before this couple purchased their house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7768)|
| 2:09:35| And, secondly, he has, in my opinion, I investigated, he has made every attempt to satisfy this couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7775)|
| 2:09:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| To the extent of building a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| Commissioner Lambert, right now I'm going to cut off all discussion right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| and I'm going to go to Commissioner Pinkston if you want to ask your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| It's one of the plaintiffs, sir, either one of those three there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| I want to be sure I've got this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| You would like for us to vote against this resolution, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| No, we want the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| We want this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7807)|
| 2:10:08| You want Commissioner Harmon's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| Commissioner Pinkston, what we want is our safety net kept where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| And that safety net for the Knox County agriculture landowners is the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7815)|
| 2:10:22| If that's taken away from us, that's going to allow this use on review to allow commercial business in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| They just have to convince the MPC to let that particular one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| I just wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| And, Mr. Lambert, you did come out to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| And I talked to you and I talked to your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| One of the first things that came out of your mouth was that you were leaning toward our neighbors without any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7842)|
| 2:10:49| As soon as I looked and saw that he lived there first, I was. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| That has nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| Like I said, I'm going to end that right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| Commissioner Pinkston, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| I was getting ready to go to that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| The motion on the floor is to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| The noes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| Now we're back on to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| I will simplify my motion by rewording, as I stated earlier, consideration. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7882)|
| 2:11:27| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Resolution of Knox County expressing the sense of Knox County Commission that commercial landscaping businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| should not be operating on land, zone, agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| and urging the Metropolitan Planning Commission to recognize that proposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| both in the abstract and the specific current cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| And I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| Well, you amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| And the best way to do it, who seconded the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| Commissioner Hammond, do you want to accept the way he has amended it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| So we don't have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| Commissioner Harmon, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Just for clarification, this resolution expresses a sense, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| So, Mark Donaldson, you're still working on procedures, policies, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7934)|
| 2:12:21| You're going to be taking this resolution, which expresses our sense. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7941)|
| 2:12:27| Sense on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| Expressing our sense and incorporating that into what you will be bringing back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7948)|
| 2:12:34| or Board of Zoning Appeals, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| We'll certainly acknowledge the sense that's voted on here within our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| But keep in mind, it is a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| and the county commission makes final action on any ordinance amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7970)|
| 2:12:57| So what you're saying is this is not set in stone because it's not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| It's just a resolution of what we're asking you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| And then you're going to have to bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| Whatever MPC recommends will be acted upon, up or down, by the commission as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7990)|
| 2:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7996)|
| 2:13:17| And we can discuss that action at that point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| That's what I was trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| Did he say he was getting a community team together to evaluate this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| If he does, I want to be on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| If you would like to get with Mr. Donaldson and find out when they're going to have some public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8011)|
| 2:13:36| and give you a chance to have your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| My understanding when they decided that they were going to get a community group up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| because there were so many people that were astounded at the speed this thing came in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| from one department to the other to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| And my understanding is that there was somebody in the audience that said, hey, wait a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| nobody knows about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| And that's when they decided to put it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| Now, when I heard how they were going to get the community groups up together to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| and one of the commissioners at MPC said, well, how are you going to get these people together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| He said, the yellow pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8048)|
| 2:14:10| We're going to go to the yellow pages and get all these landscapers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| and the ones that want to put landscaping companies in to the agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8052)|
| 2:14:18| and the community groups we work with and the people that have stood up and posed this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8058)|
| 2:14:24| Well, I e-mailed Mr. Grant 10, 11 days ago, and I didn't hear back from him until a couple days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8064)|
| 2:14:32| And there's nothing about any minions as far as I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| But the yellow pages, those people are not the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| And that's pretty desperate when you say you're going to go down in the yellow pages and pick out people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| If you're going to do that, why don't we go through the whole phone book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| and just ask everybody that has agriculture property, hey, would you like commercial business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| Mark, you'll be sure to contact neighborhood groups and other concerned citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8094)|
| 2:15:00| when you hold your public hearings on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| As we're working with the County Office of Neighborhoods and their list of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| Does everybody understand the motion in front of us is to approve as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| Chairman, I'm going to hand it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| when we established the consent calendar resolution 102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8131)|
| 2:15:38| the Cementex USA people were not here and they have arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8138)|
| 2:15:44| Could I get that withdrawn from consent so we can get this presentation made, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8144)|
| 2:15:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| So move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| Is everyone okay with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| 102?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| Which we've already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| Dave, you're going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8169)|
| 2:16:15| We've already approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| honoring Cementex USA Resolution 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| I think we've already approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8185)|
| 2:16:46| Lynn Lidington, I'm the Director of Knox County Air Quality Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| With me today, Commissioner Wright, Bill Fleming from Cementex USA here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8210)|
| 2:16:57| and Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I'm pleased to be here today to help recognize the Cementex USA Knoxville plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| for its award of the Energy Star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| Energy Star is a joint initiative of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| and the U.S. Department of Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| It focuses on strategic energy management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating environmental leadership for future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| The Knoxville plant is recognized for their efficiencies in the cement manufacturing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8243)|
| 2:17:28| Among cement manufacturers across the nation, they graded in the 90th percentile in their efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8248)|
| 2:17:35| Over the last year, the plant has identified leaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| installed variable frequency drives to replace damper controls on fans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8259)|
| 2:17:44| analyzed power consumption, identified and reduced air infiltration on the kiln system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8264)|
| 2:17:49| and reduced power usage through energy audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8269)|
| 2:17:57| I would just like to accept this on behalf of the 105 employees that work at the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| A lot of people don't realize we've been here since 1928| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| and are a viable employer in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| Can I get your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| My name is Bill Fleming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| The plant address is 6212 Cement Plant Road in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8300)|
| 2:18:34| 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| requesting a representative from Tax Management Associates, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| to appear before the Knox County Commission and present its report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| Finance made a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| I think we have a gentleman here that wants to speak on it, and I'd like to ask him some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8338)|

| 2:19:07| Who is the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| He can come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8350)|
| 2:19:11| I believe it's Mr. Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| My name is John Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| I'm with the Property Assessor's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| and I'm here to clear up some misinformation that we have floating out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8360)|
| 2:19:26| There seems to be a rumor on the Internet that the new Sentinel owes Knox County a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8366)|
| 2:19:34| As far as we can tell, they don't owe a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| They may owe some money, but not close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| We're in the process of doing an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| DMA is doing the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| They're working with the law department to get all the information right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| It's not complete, but it's real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| If everything goes through right now, the way everybody agreed on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| it would be about $25,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| It would be what they owe Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| I don't know where this information came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| It's not ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| Ten years not involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| The pilot program started in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| So, anyway, if you have any questions for me, I'll be glad to try to answer what I know of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8420)|
| 2:20:27| But if you have any questions directly to the auditor, and he's here to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| John, I'd like to ask Tim a few questions, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| Did you have a question, Commissioner Wright, for Mr. Whitehead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| Dale Baker, 2938 Melbourne Terrace, Mount Juliet, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8443)|
| 2:20:50| And on the audit for the Knoxville New Sentinel, the actual audit was I met with him on October 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8450)|
| 2:20:59| to gather the fixed asset records to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| and review what would appear to be owned by the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| and fixed assets that would possibly be owned by the Knoxville New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8469)|
| 2:21:15| Over the two or three week, maybe even a four week period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| I sent some spreadsheets over to the newspaper for them to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| We had a follow-up meeting on November the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| and the taxpayer provided me some additional information that I did not have on the original appointment on October 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8486)|
| 2:21:35| Taking that information, we discussed the spreadsheets and the things that I was proposing with the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8495)|
| 2:21:45| I then went over to the law director's office and made an appointment to meet with the law director on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| I believe it was Wednesday, November the 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| to ask them to review some of the things that had come up in my meeting with the taxpayer on the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| And that's sort of where we're at at this point in time to decide whether the way that I'm reading the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8517)|
| 2:22:06| concerning bill of sales, the consumable supplies, raw material, those types of things are correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| or if there is some misunderstanding is the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8532)|
| 2:22:19| But at this point in time, I did meet with the law director to voice those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| and I'm waiting on their opinion back before we do send out the final what we would call a position letter to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8543)|
| 2:22:33| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8553)|
| 2:22:34| Yes, what did you say your first name was, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8556)|
| 2:22:37| Dale, may I call you by your first name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8557)|
| 2:22:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| So you've been looking at this since October of last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| This year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| This year, October of this year, October 6, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| The actual fixed asset record, the agreements were turned over to us, I believe, in January or February of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8567)|
| 2:22:56| We started to read through the agreements to determine what additional work we might need to do concerning just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8576)|
| 2:23:05| as you read through them and look through them, there's several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| There's several questions as part of the resolution that the commission wanted answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| And so we've read through those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| and I made the initial appointment for October 6, 2008 to look at the fixed asset records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| Well, the reason why I call you forward, you know, you were up here once before we had you up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| and you couldn't tell us whether the agreement was enforced or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| Are there any other pilot programs out there like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| It's the ones that I've looked at to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| This is the only one that has the industrial revenue bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| Everything else is just looks like it's pure in lieu of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| This is the only one that has the industrial revenue bonds associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| But there's four out of the ten are both exempt or in lieu of for real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| and the tangible business personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| The reason why I'm asking you this is I feel like we're going to need every tax dollar we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8639)|
| 2:24:03| It's my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| I feel like it's a commission to check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| In reading this attachment here, now you correct me if I'm wrong, I believe we floated $55 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8646)|
| 2:24:12| I believe that's what the agreement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| Yes, I believe that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| The Sentinel is supposed to pay it in the taxes that it would have generated back over what the property was when we purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8656)|
| 2:24:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8664)|
| 2:24:25| They have a basic rent agreement that pays that back over a period of time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8665)|
| 2:24:29| And that's supposed to be $400 and some thousand, I believe, a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| I believe that's what the agreement says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| And that's for nine or ten years, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| The agreement's for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| Ten years, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| In this agreement, I'm reading it here, we sell them the building back for a dollar within 90 days after this agreement's fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8682)|
| 2:24:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| They do have that option, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| In this option here, in reading about the press and the price of all these, you know, the new press they bought and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8699)|
| 2:25:06| the way I take it, the IDB board owns that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| Yes, I believe there has been a bill of sale for the original equipment that was put in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8710)|
| 2:25:15| that's been sold to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| Does this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8719)|
| 2:25:20| I couldn't find anywhere it just says the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| It doesn't state this printing press or anything like that that we bought and paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| It says project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| I mean, you could say that that does include it, but I take the project as being when they built it down there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8729)|
| 2:25:36| That is part of the project, not the equipment that went in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| I believe if you read through the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| it talks about conveying over a bill of sale to the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| and being specific into what you've turned over to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| and I believe that would take care of selling the equipment to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| When this was voted upon, it was voted to keep 600 jobs inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8756)|
| 2:26:03| As I read the agreement and, like I said, I've turned that over to the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8763)|
| 2:26:08| that is not specifically in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| It is an attachment where it talks about approximately 600 jobs will be kept with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8770)|
| 2:26:17| and they would still be inside the city, but inside the agreement itself I've not read that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8777)|
| 2:26:23| and that is something that's being looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8785)|
| 2:26:26| These attachments, it's cost versus, you know, benefit analysis for payment in lieu of ad valorem tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| says 375 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| Have any of these been created?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| I believe if you read the attachment before that, the exhibit, it talks about creating construction jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8797)|
| 2:26:43| and I'm thinking that that's what that is related to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| But having not been there when the agreement was written, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| But it talks about creating some construction jobs while this facility is being, you know, built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8810)|
| 2:26:56| But those are temporary jobs, were they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| But then it goes on to talk about the 600 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| So that's, like I said, I didn't write it, so I don't know what the intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| But just reading through it, that's what it would appear to me that those are analysis of those temporary jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8827)|
| 2:27:15| But that's just the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| Well, you know, it says new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| I don't look at temporary jobs as new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| Of course, they may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| The sales tax revenue was projected at $1,284,700 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8846)|
| 2:27:33| Where was this to arrive from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| I haven't seen any new growth down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| Those are areas, like I said, that was the, when the agreement was written between the taxpayer and the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8858)|
| 2:27:44| those were calculations that I'm not privy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| I mean, I can see if the development corporation may have those old notes about that, how they came up with that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| But that's, I don't know that I can verify the sales issue through the review that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8874)|
| 2:28:01| Well, like I said, I don't know anything about a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| I haven't heard that until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| But I just don't see where there's 375 new jobs at when we're laying people off down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8886)|
| 2:28:14| Here again, like I said, I didn't write it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| I mean, I'm just reading the agreement as I read through it and look through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8896)|
| 2:28:21| And, like I said, the 375, as I read it, I thought it was talking about the construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| But, you know, I've turned that over to the law director to see, you know, if the way I read it is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| I may be incorrect on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| Well, if that's the case, this was certainly a bad agreement for the city of Knoxville and Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| I think you'll have to agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| Well, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| You may not want to say, but you'll have to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| Well, what we're trying to do for the commission, I mean, it's part of the, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8925)|
| 2:28:51| the contract that you asked us to do is to look through these agreements and to come back to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8931)|
| 2:28:57| with full reports, the equipment that the IDB, the Industrial Development Board owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| possibly stuff that the taxpayer owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| And as you could look at it, you could see whether it was a good deal or a bad deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| I don't really know, you know, the benefits as you read through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| It talks about them being inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| So, here again, having not written the agreement, having not been around the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| the intent would appear to have been to keep them inside the city with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| So, at the end of the day, when you look at all the information that hopefully we'll provide, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8963)|
| 2:29:28| the commission can look at it whether they believe it was a good deal or a bad deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| I don't believe there's a person in this room that thought the Senate would move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8971)|
| 2:29:37| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| I'm not trying to give you a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| We just need every tax dollar we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8981)|
| 2:29:42| And if they're out of compliance, I certainly want it collected whether it's $25,000 or not or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8982)|
| 2:29:48| If it's a dollar, I want it or the citizens of Knoxville want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| And that's our intent is to bring you the information correctly, correct information, bring it to, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8992)|
| 2:29:59| we work through the assessor's office and issue what we would call a position letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| But at this time, I've presented the information as I've gathered it to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| to get the opinion to see if that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| You're on a contract with the assessor, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9012)|
| 2:30:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| If there's any more, I'd like for you to ask for the property assessor to give them to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| because we certainly want them all checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| I believe there are 16 more that I'm aware of that we're getting through these and we'll start on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9020)|
| 2:30:27| Well, I'd like for you to get it just as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| They are at the top of my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| This was bought up a year ago practically, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| we haven't gotten any further now than just where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| And I'd like for the property assessor to get you the information a lot faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| Well, we are at the top of my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| My calendar is completely clean for the rest of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| and then through the first quarter of next year to work on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| Commissioner McKinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9053)|
| 2:30:54| I guess I need to ask the law director a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| In 2002, I actually sat on the city of Knoxville Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9057)|
| 2:31:04| doing this pilot process, so I wanted to get your opinion on my vote on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9064)|
| 2:31:11| How did you vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| I voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| Mr. Law Director, may I ask Mr. McKinley a question since he sat on that board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| How did you take these jobs to be these 375 new jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| Well, they talked about a portion of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| a large portion of them being transient type construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| But I also do think at that time that there was a big push from newspapers to move outside of their city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9091)|
| 2:31:39| I don't know, Baltimore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| A whole lot of those other newspapers did move their headquarters out where, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9101)|
| 2:31:47| the land was cheaper and they only had to pay one set of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| So it was a real, I don't want to call it a threat, but it was a real issue at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9111)|
| 2:32:00| Commissioner, I'm the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| I don't take or vote on policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| and the issue that I've been asked to look at is a very discreet legal issue on interpreting the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9127)|
| 2:32:16| And once my office renders an opinion, the auditor will take that and incorporate it into his report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9136)|
| 2:32:25| and it will significantly impact, I think, the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| But all I'm doing is looking at a legal issue in terms of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9149)|
| 2:32:35| And in your capacity in 2002, you made a policy judgment that you thought was best, and it's not my place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9155)|
| 2:32:45| and I don't have the information and would not second guess you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9165)|
| 2:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9170)|
| 2:32:51| Well, you know, so I will disclose that, in fact, I did sit on the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9171)|
| 2:32:59| but I really don't feel that this issue, I think they need to fulfill the contract that was laid before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9179)|
| 2:33:05| So I'm going to go ahead and vote in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9185)|
| 2:33:12| The motion on the floor is to have a representative to report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9192)|
| 2:33:17| I think he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| Yes, we still need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| But he really doesn't have the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| Oh, he doesn't have the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| I finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| That's what I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| Is that correct, Dale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9205)|
| 2:33:28| Oh, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9208)|
| 2:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9210)|
| 2:33:31| As soon as I get that, I should be able to turn it around very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| And as far as timing, Commissioners, as he said, we got the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9213)|
| 2:33:39| and saw it for the first time this past Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9219)|
| 2:33:42| And we're looking at the information and going through the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9222)|
| 2:33:48| and I anticipate being able to get back with this gentleman before the end of this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9228)|
| 2:33:55| and give him our opinion, and then he can incorporate that into the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9235)|
| 2:34:02| and go forward at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9242)|
| 2:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| Scott Moore, 5307 Taunton Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| I was working on this prior to last December when the Commission approved the audits for the pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9256)|
| 2:34:24| And just for clarification and just for the people at home to realize that the city of Knoxville issued a bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9264)|
| 2:34:31| in the amount of $55 million on top of forgiving their taxes for the period of time until 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9271)|
| 2:34:42| I don't know if this has been done in any other of the pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| but the taxpayer basically the city financed it as basically something like a bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9284)|
| 2:34:50| and gave them $55 million to buy their building and buy their presses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| So just for the citizens at home to know that to add into this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9294)|
| 2:35:02| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9308)|
| 2:35:09| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| I thought the report wasn't complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| It's my understanding he was just going to report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| Do we need any action on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| He said there wasn't a report that he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| But, I mean, you're going to be getting us a report right after you talk to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| But it's still in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| It's still a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| I'd like to make a motion to withdraw this until we get the report in its finality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9332)|
| 2:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9347)|
| 2:35:55| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9355)|
| 2:35:58| approving a purchase agreement in the amount of $6 million with Hillcrest Health Care Communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9358)|
| 2:36:04| Inc., for real property located at 5321 and 5325 Beverly Park Circle, 6801 Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9364)|
| 2:36:11| which includes 2820 Lakebrook Boulevard and 1758 Hillwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9379)|
| 2:36:26| Finance, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9388)|
| 2:36:29| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| 7-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9392)|
| 2:36:40| I would move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9410)|
| 2:36:53| We have some people here who would like to talk on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| I have Judge Bozeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| He wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9422)|
| 2:37:03| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| Mr. Chairman and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| Can I get your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| My name is Howard Bozeman, 4801 Harvard Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9430)|
| 2:37:19| I want to speak to you not on a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9439)|
| 2:37:24| For as I'm concerned, you're standing as a committee of the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9444)|
| 2:37:28| Parliamentary, somebody would say I move we be a committee of the whole for the purpose of discussing what it is I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9448)|
| 2:37:36| The question of what you do with it becomes your responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9456)|
| 2:37:41| I am not speaking for a motion or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9461)|
| 2:37:47| It's your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| I want to answer some of the questions that apparently have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9469)|
| 2:37:55| I think maybe the mayor raised the question as it came to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| What is the county doing in the hospital business or the nursing home business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9480)|
| 2:38:07| How did it ever come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9487)|
| 2:38:12| That's the reason you have to go back in a little history to look and see how it first came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9492)|
| 2:38:19| We became a city in 1791, as I'm sure you know, and a state in 1796.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9499)|
| 2:38:26| In 1798, the county of Knox set a tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9506)|
| 2:38:35| They set a tax rate for the general operation of their affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| Secondly, they set a poor tax rate to take care of the poor, whether it was health they needed, whether it was clothes, or whether it was housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9519)|
| 2:38:51| From that year in 1798 until today, it has been the responsibility of the county of Knox to look after its citizens, its poor citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9531)|
| 2:39:06| and the way in which, through the years, it has been brought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9546)|
| 2:39:12| I've started at the beginning. I'm going to move almost to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| We had a three-member Board of County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| One of them was called the Welfare and Health Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9561)|
| 2:39:26| One of them was called the Highway and Bridge Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| The other one was called the Welfare and Health Highway and Bridges Finance and Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9571)|
| 2:39:39| That was the three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| That started in the year roughly 1938-39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9582)|
| 2:39:47| The first election was in 1938 or 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9587)|
| 2:39:54| When I became county judge, that commission had been operating and was misunderstood by an awful lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9594)|
| 2:40:02| even by the two people who wrote a history of the county of Knox and its governmental affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9602)|
| 2:40:10| Both of those authors were uninformed because they did not read what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9610)|
| 2:40:19| Before I became county judge, I read every law dealing with the operation of the county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9619)|
| 2:40:25| and I was classified as the fiscal agent of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| All the things that had to do with money had to pass by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| Every fee office in the county had to file a report with me every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9636)|
| 2:40:43| I came through a county auditor that we then had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| so that it was my responsibility to look after the county affairs and what it was we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9648)|
| 2:40:55| The current operation of those items that I just mentioned were under the Board of County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| but were never done without the approval of the fiscal agent of the county, who was the county judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9661)|
| 2:41:10| In 1958, Bob Wilson was elected to the welfare and health part of the three-member board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9670)|
| 2:41:21| Charlie Spangler was the highway commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| Bill Tallet was the finance and purchasing commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| He came to me and said, something needs to be done with George Maloney Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| Nobody had to tell me that. I knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| I had already done a whole lot to it by raising the building that was the worst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9697)|
| 2:41:44| where people lived, where they were given hospital care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9704)|
| 2:41:50| We had a county physician whose name was Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| We had a county health director whose name was Huffstadler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9714)|
| 2:41:59| They were really without the facilities to run and operate those two functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9719)|
| 2:42:07| He said, I would like for us to build a health nursing home or old folks care on George Maloney property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9727)|
| 2:42:19| and we'll call it the ABC building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| I said, I think that would be fine, and they got Carl Maples to design that facility, and it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9742)|
| 2:42:33| Health, that was health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| Medical care, that was medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| Poor, that was poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| Time passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9762)|
| 2:42:45| Backing up a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| There was an East Tennessee Tuberculosis Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9767)|
| 2:42:52| People who were on that was Dr. Herbert Acuff, who's one of the great surgeons in the history of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9772)|
| 2:43:01| Ed Ashe, who became president of Standard Knitting Mill, and the person before him who was president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9781)|
| 2:43:08| When I became county judge, I became a member of the Beverly Hills Sanatorium Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9788)|
| 2:43:16| Basically, there were four members on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| Ed Ashe was president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| I was vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9801)|
| 2:43:22| It had a secretary and a voter, and that operation was run and operated before I became county judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9802)|
| 2:43:35| The East Tennessee Tuberculosis Association bought the piece of property known as Beverly Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9815)|
| 2:43:42| and on that piece of property, they built three buildings, and that was known as the ABC building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9822)|
| 2:43:48| and hired Dr. Nave in 1929 to run and operate the affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9828)|
| 2:43:54| Knox County, Knox County had a part in it, and Knox County was responsible for the operation there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9834)|
| 2:44:02| as it is for any citizen within the county that can fall within those categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9842)|
| 2:44:10| Sometimes, whether indigent or not, that's one of the major responsibilities of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9850)|
| 2:44:19| Judge Boatman, I failed to tell you we have a five-minute limit, and I didn't tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9859)|
| 2:44:24| but go ahead and give you a couple more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| If you want to know it, if you don't want to know it, there's no reason for me to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9872)|
| 2:44:33| I'd like to hear it also, if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| No objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9878)|
| 2:44:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9879)|
| 2:44:45| The tuberculosis group conveyed to the state of Tennessee what's known as Beverly Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9885)|
| 2:44:52| hoping that they would build a chest disease hospital there taking care of the tuberculosis group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9892)|
| 2:45:00| The building you see out there, what you might call the old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9900)|
| 2:45:06| was the building built by the state of Tennessee for this tuberculosis problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9906)|
| 2:45:14| which was rampant before the drug came out to take care of the tuberculosis problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9914)|
| 2:45:20| and also the chest disease business of the people who got cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9920)|
| 2:45:32| All of that died down as the drug took effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9932)|
| 2:45:39| And when I went back into office in 1974,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| Lord Martian, who was made the director of Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9942)|
| 2:45:48| and Hillcrest was named by the county, not by somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9948)|
| 2:45:53| The board of Hillcrest originally was set up by the three-member board of county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9953)|
| 2:45:59| I did not appoint a single person to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| The director was hired by the three-member board of county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9962)|
| 2:46:06| and Lord Martian became that director in 1966 and did a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9966)|
| 2:46:15| We took Hillcrest and built two other very large buildings there for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9975)|
| 2:46:21| Health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| So I don't want anybody to ever say again that you have not been in the health care business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9984)|
| 2:46:30| That would be untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| When the state was getting tired of the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9992)|
| 2:46:39| Lord said, why don't you go talk to the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| and see if the governor will have the property conveyed to the county of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10003)|
| 2:46:52| and that the property be fixed for nursing home services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10012)|
| 2:46:59| The state of Tennessee agreed and spent $1,670,000 on the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10019)|
| 2:47:08| so that it would meet all of the requirements necessary to take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10028)|
| 2:47:14| the medical problems that were anticipated to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10034)|
| 2:47:20| That's where Hillcrest, Beverly became a part of Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10040)|
| 2:47:27| I thank the governor for letting the county of Knox have that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10047)|
| 2:47:32| to serve the citizens of our community for the purpose for which it was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10052)|
| 2:47:39| A little bit later on, I'm sure you know that the period of time that I was away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10059)|
| 2:47:45| and before 1974, the county commission bought a shell south of the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10065)|
| 2:47:53| and another shell on the west end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| It didn't have any walls in it. It didn't have any covers in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| It was a shell. It had the posts that go up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| And the question is whether or not we can make a nursing home out of those two facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10086)|
| 2:48:12| for the citizens of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| Joe Goodstein and I went to Nashville and had to clear three engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10094)|
| 2:48:19| three engineering groups, including the state fire marshal and everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10099)|
| 2:48:24| They virtually had to rebuild that section of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10104)|
| 2:48:28| Yes, the county bought it, and yes, the county finished it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10108)|
| 2:48:35| And there are two great honorable things that serves people in the community where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10115)|
| 2:48:43| What was the reason to have Hillcrest the way we had it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10123)|
| 2:48:49| We didn't have anybody to administer it other than to look after it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| through the health and welfare commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10134)|
| 2:49:00| We needed a board that was able to find somebody who was able to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| and take care of that facility under the direction of the county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10145)|
| 2:49:11| And it remained under that direction, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10151)|
| 2:49:16| until I left the county judgeship in 1982 for the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10156)|
| 2:49:24| If you have any question about whether the county of Knox is in the hospital business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10164)|
| 2:49:31| we plan to have a University of Tennessee research center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10171)|
| 2:49:39| And the 14th plank of my platform in 1948 was that I would cooperate with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10179)|
| 2:49:50| to build a general hospital in conjunction with the research center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10190)|
| 2:49:58| We had a county physician, our appearance, which is one of the great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10198)|
| 2:50:04| We had the commissioner of public health in Nashville to assign to us or recommend to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10204)|
| 2:50:12| a man he said could take his place. His name was Dr. Ferris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10212)|
| 2:50:18| With that, of course, we built the health center on Cleveland Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| when the hospital was built over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10224)|
| 2:50:27| Gentlemen, you are in the health business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| We have the finest health departments you could get anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10230)|
| 2:50:35| I built the first building and the second building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| They tore down the first to build the third, the sections to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10239)|
| 2:50:44| And it's great to be in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10244)|
| 2:50:49| If you have an organization running and operating the Hillcrest situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10249)|
| 2:50:58| then it seems to me like some effort should be made to find out how they're operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10258)|
| 2:51:05| It didn't cost the county anything except to build the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| Medicaid, all the other things that go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10270)|
| 2:51:15| And it's up to somebody, the mayor or his commissioner of health and welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10275)|
| 2:51:22| to see that it is properly operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10282)|
| 2:51:26| If they get fined, as I have noticed by the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10286)|
| 2:51:30| there have been fines recently there, it's a crying shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10290)|
| 2:51:37| Lord Marchant would turn over in his grave, as would the girl that follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10297)|
| 2:51:46| You've got two people who want to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| I say to you that it is a very, almost to me, unconscionable situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10309)|
| 2:52:02| When you have what you have, you don't have to do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10322)|
| 2:52:08| I was among those who had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10328)|
