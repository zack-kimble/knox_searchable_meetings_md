| 0:02:06| to CA general business located at 0 Asheville Highway, partial ID 061-07104, part of, in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=126)|

| 0:02:26| Thank you. Is there any opposition that wishes to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=146)|
| 0:02:35| Seeing none, Director Brooks, would you please read the recommendation of planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the CA general business zone for the portion of the parcel requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| because it is consistent with the sector plan and would result in more consistent zoning for the subject property by a vote of 13-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| Thank you. Are there any questions from the commission about this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=174)|
| 0:03:03| Mr. Mullins, would you like to speak to the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| Just briefly, I appreciate staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| This is a split zone, part of its own commercial, part of its own PR, 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| We're seeking to expand the commercial zoning to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| It's still a good boundary and buffer from the residential neighbors to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| This will just allow more intentional development there on the Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| They don't have any specific plans, but this would allow them to address issues with access and stormwater in a more intentional way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=212)|
| 0:03:42| Thank you. Commissioners, are there any questions or comments? Commissioner Fraser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just like to add I had a good conversation with Mr. Mullins about future potential use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| just making sure that any businesses that go into this location will be community friendly and they will keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=234)|
| 0:04:02| Yes, thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| Seeing no other lights, I'll turn it over to the District Commissioner, Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate the comments, Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| I, too, appreciate you, Mr. Mullins, being willing to meet with me despite being somewhat indisposed and explaining this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=256)|
| 0:04:26| And I have met with the residents there in Neils Landing several times about their water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| I think it's well known that the creek behind some of those residents' houses does flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| So, I will look to Mr. Snowden to ensure that whatever goes on this does not exacerbate that in any way whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| So, with that being said, since part of this parcel is already CA, my motion is that we approve the rezoning from PR to CA as recommended by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=288)|
| 0:05:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=302)|

| 0:06:37| I've got a trailer grandfathered in on one side, on my prop's half, and then the other half I wish to sell to boost my social security retirement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=397)|

| 0:07:05| We recently actually changed the sector plan, I believe, for Mr. Chabon, did we not? Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=425)|

| 0:12:24| Then the opposition will also have five minutes and the applicant can respond for a few minutes afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| Go ahead, Mr. Mullins. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| This is a rezoning request for what we asked for at the planning commission stage and what the planning staff and planning commission recommended was five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=753)|
| 0:12:48| I've spoken with most of you and I hope most of you caught me when I wasn't on pain medicines when I did speak with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=768)|
| 0:12:56| We are now asking to reduce our application to 3.7 dwelling units an acre because between the planning commission meeting and now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=776)|
| 0:13:07| we've been able to put together a site plan that is going to be heard, pending the results of this rezoning, by planning commission in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=787)|
| 0:13:16| So we're looking to reduce our request to 3.7 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| We spent a great deal of time speaking with the neighborhood, both a larger neighborhood meeting in August that I was unable to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=800)|
| 0:13:29| but representatives of Clayton Homes and Commissioner Daly was able to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| and the four neighbors that are to the south of this property that are most directly affected because they have an easement that runs through this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=815)|
| 0:13:45| and that easement will remain throughout the development of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| We've been working with them regarding their concerns and how we can protect their easement rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| both during construction and after the subdivision has been built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| This is in the planned growth area. It is our next door neighbor to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| is South Doyle High School. Bonnie Kate Elementary is 100 yards or so to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=847)|
| 0:14:15| The sector plan is in place for low-density residential, which in the county means anywhere between one and five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| 3.7 is right in the middle of that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| In fact, if you look at the six closest planned residential zonings around this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=866)|
| 0:14:34| you're going to see a range of five dwelling units an acre on the other side of South Doyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| four dwelling units an acre across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| and then three dwelling units an acre a little further south and a little further west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| You average those together, that's 3.8 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| so 3.7 is right in line with what's developed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| It's accessed by Tipton Station Road, which is a major collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| It has 20 feet of pavement and 40 feet right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| There is a sidewalk that runs on the south side of Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| It runs just to the property right before Bonnie Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| I know I had a conversation with Commissioner Frazier about the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| and it looks like that sidewalk ends right before Bonnie Kate Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| We are talking to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| We'll have internal sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| We're talking to the school system about locating a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| or a path from our property directly to South Doyle right next to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| The exact location of that I don't think we've worked out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| Anywhere in the county during peak hours, school hours, you're going to have bad traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| and this is no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Traffic does back up there during school hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| It backs up in West Knoxville where I drop my kids off at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| But I did reach out to Commissioner Snowden or Director Snowden about the level of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| and it was estimated at five units an acre that we'd be putting about 1,000 additional vehicles on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=969)|
| 0:16:19| It was Director Snowden's opinion that Tipton Station could manage that additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| Reducing that down to 3.7 is going to be less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| I don't know what exactly those numbers are, but that's something that the road can manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=988)|
| 0:16:37| and I think there's some people that are going to speak that would encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| that there may be some infrastructure projects in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| When we were looking at the type of density for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| this is right in line with what the sector plan and the growth policy plan allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| We are going to continue to work with the neighbors with the site plan as it comes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| about what to do with the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| I don't think we've got all the details worked out on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| but we are trying to be very intentional with our conversations with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| and trying to be a really good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| It makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| You have a piece of property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| It's kind of an island of agricultural zoning around PR zones right next to a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| It's going to get developed at some point, and I think we have a local company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| It's been local here for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| It has people invested in the community, and the density makes sense for this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| and we'd ask that you follow Planning Commission's recommendation and vote to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| I also have some representatives from Clayton that can answer any questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| I will get your recommendation in a moment, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| and I'd like opposition to come forward and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1082)|
| 0:18:11| If you'd state your name and address, please, and you have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| I live on Tipton Station in Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| You guys have my address on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Excuse me one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Could we start the clock, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| I'm talking against this development because I live on Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| I live about three miles from where this development is coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| and the traffic on Tipton Station during school zone time and also during rush hour is horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| I can't get out of my driveway half the time because if there is an accident on Chapman Highway right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| they do swing them through Tipton Station to Pick and Gap and then back down onto Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| School time, when you're sitting, when you're going down towards John Sevier off Tipton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| you cannot get past Bonnie Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| They block the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Bonnie Kate is blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| You cannot get around school pickup at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| I don't know how many of you commissioners ever drove down Tipton Station during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| but you can't get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Emergency vehicles would not be able to get through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| I don't want this property because it also is right next to South Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| It's going to cause overcrowding to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| We have three other developments that are still being developed that are feeding into this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| We have one high school, one middle school in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| They are going to overcrowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| I keep hearing, no, they're not, no, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| I have friends who have a senior at South Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| They say the teacher-to-student ratio is outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| I'm Spencer Proctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| I live at 2122 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| I'm one of the four neighbors that lives adjacent to the property being proposed of a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| My specific opposition is more for the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| The initial opposition through the Planning Commission was the, I do oppose the entirety of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| but as Mr. Mullins has said, we've worked together, and I'm okay with their 3.7 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1220)|
| 0:20:28| I wanted to use just a few minutes, if it's okay with you all, to address my concerns at the outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| As I studied the 72-page sector plan for South County, I hear a lot, both in Planning Commission and in this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1235)|
| 0:20:44| it's referenced regularly, which is great to have the sector plan, and I know that was a voted-on document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| and I feel that it was voted on as an entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| But when we look at the sector plan, there's a five-year and a 15-year plan included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| and the amount of things that have not even been touched on those plans is outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| The things that have been touched are privatized money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| and so we've approved neighborhood after neighborhood after neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| and we haven't addressed the infrastructure issues with Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| The LOS of Tipton Station wasn't horrible in 2012 when they addressed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| but for John Sevier, it was already at a D on a scale down from A to F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| It was already at a D on John Sevier, and a John Sevier hasn't been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| In that same sector plan, it's called for adjustments, improvements to John Sevier by 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| and those have not begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Money hasn't been designated for that, to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| And so my request in standing here with you is I understand, and I should speak only for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| I understand that growth and expansion is inevitable and necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| but that growth strategically is the wisest plan forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| And so if we're looking at the community, just to say there is an infrastructure in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| because there are sidewalks and a library I think is missing the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| I think that there are, as mentioned, the traffic is a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| This is between school zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| To exit this neighborhood, you cannot avoid a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| It is not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| There's not a back road, no way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| You're in a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| The traffic mentioned by Mr. Mullins is this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| but that doesn't include the 33 homes across the street that are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| the 176 homes off John Sevier Highway that are directly down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| and among many, many, many more in this Chapman Highway corridor that have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| So the concerns that I feel I do represent a lot of community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| even in the meeting that was mentioned with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| I'm not sure that anybody at that community meeting was in favor of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| And the Planning Commission has a comment section that there were 88 comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| 80 of them opposed, 8 of them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| And I'll just speak to my experience with the Planning Commission that I stood up and spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| and honestly felt relatively dismissed and unheard in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| and I feel like this is a better body to speak to because you are elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| So I'm asking and happy to clarify any thoughts or questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| but in looking at that sector plan that is referenced regularly as a standard by which we operate on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| there's not many things that are being touched outside of privatized money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| So we would very much like for you to consider the expansion and improvement of Tipton Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| the expansion and improvement of John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| so that things like traffic and school overcrowding are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| I know that those things are in the works and years down the road maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| but we come up against them quickly when houses are being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| So those are the main concerns, and I would, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| part of the issues that I've talked to Commissioner Daley about is that the community is able to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1432)|
| 0:24:00| in a lot of these conversations, but it's difficult to know how and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| And when this sector plan was approved, I was graduating college, not married yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| not with my three children, haven't moved onto the property that I now own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| That was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| And so to approve things and stand by them when the community that is now deeply involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| was not able to be involved during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| I feel like there should be quicker updates or honest changes to sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| when things are not being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Thank you. Thank you so much for speaking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| Did you have a brief comment, Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Just briefly, I appreciate Mr. Proctor and Ms. Keene's comments, and the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| Ms. Frazier and I spoke, Commissioner Frazier and I spoke about as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| and I wasn't able to actually reach out to South Doyle and Bonnie Kate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| to see what their capacity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| But I do know the planning staff, when they put their reports together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| they have a method that's derived from data that I think they share with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| about what the student yield would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| And at five units an acre, we were looking at 22 students at buildout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| among three different schools is what they had estimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| If that's directly proportional to breaking it down to 3.7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| we're looking at 16 to 17 students over three schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| And that's not just an immediate dump of 16, 17 students into the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| That's kind of matriculated over time and doesn't account for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| that move through the school system as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| So I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| I understand the frustration about some of the infrastructure out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| I have to rely upon my conversations with Mr. Snowden that says that Tipton Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| the level of service would still be within an acceptable level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| average trips per day with this development, even at the five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| much less the 3.7 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| So I would be happy to answer any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| but I'd still appreciate it if you would approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Director Brooks, would you please read the recommendation for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR plan residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| because it's compatible with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| and supported by a close proximity to community facilities by a vote of 13 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Seeing no other lights, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| First of all, I want to thank Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Spencer's been a voice of reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| He's done a lot of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| He has met with CMH Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| He's met with Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| Yes, we do have some problems out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Yes, we do have Tipton Station Road that is really our only east-west road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| besides Governor John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Correct, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| It is on a plan to widen, but once we get to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| who knows when we're going to get to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| It will be widened one of these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| I'll soon be 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| I don't know if I'll see it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Hopefully I'll see it in the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Yes, John Sevier has been spoken about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| John Sevier, Jim's lovely wife, Miss Amanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| There's going to be some work done there to improve some intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| I'm trying to get them TDOT not to spend money on the intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| Go ahead and widen from Alcoa Highway to Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| and that will reduce 80% of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| 80% of the traffic gets off at Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| You don't need to expand John Sevier Highway all the way to Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| I think they're very receptive about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| but it takes seven years, if I'm not correct, to start a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| after they get their funding going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| So, yes, John Sevier is going to be four lanes, hopefully sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| We talk about overcrowded at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Bonnie Kate, yes, Bonnie Kate is overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| It's on the South Knoxville plan to be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Where we're going to expand it is going to be the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Do we lose the old facade of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| or do we take the teacher's parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| That's going to be a question, but it's in the plans to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| New Hope Elementary, we're going to get 1,000-student elementary school here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| I'm pushing for 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| I'm asking the mayor to move it up to 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| It's in the plans, and we do have a lot of growth there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| The high school is not overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| The high school can handle 400 more students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| We're at less than 1,000 in the 900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Middle school is getting close, but I think we've got room there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| If we had to expand the middle school, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| So, yeah, would I like to see things the way they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| Were? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| But I've been there 60-some-odd years, 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| So I've known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| I've been there when a lot of people's houses weren't built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| You know, my house was the only house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| My house and the other two houses were the only houses on my road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| That's not that way anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| The sidewalk, we approved, denied on the consent on the education calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| For Bonnecate, that's been approved, so we'll get on that real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| So hopefully by Mr. Snowden, maybe three months, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| We can have that in there in three months, so that sidewalk will extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| The missing link is no longer going to be a missing link there for Bonnecate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| So I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| The concept plan calls for 72, I think, but we're asking 3.7, which is 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1830)|
| 0:30:38| Ben, does that include the farmhouse and the rancher in that 74?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| The concept plan includes the farmhouse and the rancher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| The 3.7 is just, you know, the concept plan could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| We're still working with them about maybe what to do with the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| whether that can be moved or abandoned at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| So that gives us a little bit of leeway one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| But if the concept plan was approved moving forward with what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| it would be 71 total, including the two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| Mr. Snowden, do you think that a turn lane riding in could be put there to help some of the traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1877)|
| 0:31:26| It will not help the Bonnecate traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| The only way to help the Bonnecate traffic is four-lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| and we're not going to be able to do that any time soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| We had asked the applicant, and Ben may know about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| I haven't seen it, to do a traffic impact letter to look at the warrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| for those auxiliary turn lanes for the right-turn de-sale and the left-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| I haven't seen that study yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| It wasn't going to be a full-blown study, but just an analysis of those auxiliary lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| Unfortunately, I don't have that information just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| It would benefit the new development there if there was a right-hand turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| I'm sure that you all would not have a problem putting a right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| We can't have a right out, of course, but we can have a right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| If it warrants calls, I trust the highway department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| They know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| That's about all the questions I see some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| Before I make a motion, I'll turn it over to the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| Thank you. Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| Commissioner Daley asked some of the questions I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Director Snowden, is Tifton Station Road, is it on the road improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| and can you tell me what the timeline is for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| If so or if not, can it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| Sure. It has shown up on previous plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| It was not identified as part of the advanced NOx process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| They looked at kind of a little smaller segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Right now, we've got a count station close by this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| It shows about 4,000 vehicles per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| With the width that the current roadway has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| probably varies between 10 and 11 foot lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| so you're probably 20 to 22 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| It would be something that in the absence of crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| which we don't see also here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| that it would be sometime many, many years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| It would probably be in excess of 10 years before we looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| I think Commissioner Daley makes a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| We are working with TDOT and think the expansion of Johnsonville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| from Chapman Highway to Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| especially with the completion of Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| would bring a whole lot of value to that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| You did state that you're going to request a traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Can you just kind of briefly discuss what are the types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| that we could possibly require of the applicant to improve Tifton Station Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| Sure. One of the things that we asked them to do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| obviously, we want to make sure that their line of sight is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| which we think it probably is, but we want to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| And then when we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| we certainly want to make sure that their development traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| both the slowing rights and the stopping lefts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| are outside of the through traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| to avoid what these folks are talking about as far as additional delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| So we have asked them to do a traffic analysis of that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| and then look at our access control policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| to see if it complies with the warrants for the right and the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| And if it does, we would require that of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| and their concept plan that would be heard by Planning Commission in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you, Director Schneider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Mr. Mullins, you plan to cluster most of these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| because of the environmental constraints with that blue line stream, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| Well, when you say cluster, I mean we're making a traditional subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| I think the lots vary between like 5,000 and 10,000 square feet per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| The existing lots are larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| There are some environmental constraints to the west of the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| where there's some flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| There's a floodway zone there as well that we'll have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| But yes, it's going to be trying to avoid the more difficult areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| and put the lots where they make the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Commissioner Daley, I tried to get him to help us out with sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| all the way down Tipton Station, but he didn't go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| This question is for Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Is it my understanding that you've already filed a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| with Knox Planning for the October meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| There's a concept plan that is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| The staff's recommendation isn't out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| and so there's still room to work on that with what the county wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| And you're identifying on that plan 71 building units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| plus two additional existing structures for a total of 73?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| I think it's a total of 71 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Is that including the two houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| That includes the two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| There's a pre-1900 farmhouse and a 1960s rancher on the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| now that are going to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| So if I'm doing my math correctly, that's 3.5 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| based on your concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| I'll trust your math more than I trust my math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| So I guess if you've already filed a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| why would you want to ask for a higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| which would be closer to 76 lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| I think it would be 74 lots with 3.7 on it is what I did the math before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| Is it 20.67?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| 20.67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| And the reason for that, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| is we're still working with the neighbors about potentially whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| they would be willing to abandon the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| and use the public roads or relocate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| and that gives us some more room to revise that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| It might give us more room to address the capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| needed for some of the improvements that the county may recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| after our traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Seeing no other lines, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Good question, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| There's more negotiations going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2262)|

| 0:37:48| And Clayton Holmes and Ben, I asked you to work with Spencer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| Mr. Proctor, and especially on the concept plan coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| on the screening, the vegetation, type screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| make a good screening and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| Like I say, I wish that a lot of times they don't get along too well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| but Spencer's been awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| He's been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| He's been the go-between between the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| and Spencer and I have had a lot of texting and calling each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| so I think Spencer's learned a little bit about zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| and sector plans and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2307)|

| 0:40:46| Being, Mr. Ward, that you're in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| I see that this is just a little over an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| Could you share with me your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| It's actually the homeowner had requested this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| The property is currently zoned agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| which would require one acre minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| They're wanting to create a lot in the rear for their daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| I believe, to construct a house on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| and that was the reason for the change to the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| was to allow the additional lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| And it is on sanitary sewer at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| which is, with agricultural zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| that's why you get the one acre minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| is because of the wells and the septic requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| which is no longer an issue with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2489)|

| 0:41:32| that we approve the RA, low-density residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| because it is an extension of the zoning from the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| and is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2502)|

| 0:43:00| Would you like to speak to this item, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| I can explain what I'm planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I have a house on a three-quarter acre lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| in the Birchfield subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| I'd like to build a garage with an apartment above it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| but the subdivision is zoned RAE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| which does not allow any second dwelling on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| So my request is to change to RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| which would allow a permit on review, use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| So then my plan, if you approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| would be to go to planning and request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2622)|

| 0:43:46| Ms. Brooks, can you just explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| I don't think I've ever seen RAE in six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| Can you explain what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| We don't have a lot of it in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| but this zone is exclusively residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| You'll notice in some of the other zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| that other types of uses are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| For instance, like in the RA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| you can have churches and schools and gardening and horticulture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| public golf courses, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| but in the RAE it is exclusively residential uses only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| houses, accessory uses, building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| Did I get that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Public utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| It is very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Okay, so accessory buildings with a residence is allowed in RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| RA and not RAE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I can't even talk, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| would an additional septic system need to support this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| I know because we're going outside of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| in this subdivision, if we approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| I'm concerned about the capacity of the septic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Director Snowden, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Yes, if approved by Planning Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| before we would issue a building permit for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| we would require the Health Department certify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| that there was adequate supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| I actually have a permit for a second septic system from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| That was some of the pre-work that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| I'm probably one of the few commissioners that knows what an RAE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| zone is just because of my previous tenure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| with the Council of West Knox County homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| This zoning designation is very unique in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| and it was originally set up probably 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| 60 years ago for those communities where it would be basically very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| very low density residentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| In fact, if you look at the street, it's only 15 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| So that should tell you right away that this is not a high volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| The other thing is, because he's right on the Clinch River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| this whole community was designated just that kind of neat area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| And the requirements are that you could only have your home and any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| accessory building cover 30% of the lot, which is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| So it was designed to give that open area around the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| And of course the staff recommended denial of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| and it's probably because they're very familiar with the RAE zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| I don't think the planning commissioners probably have ever heard of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| before, just like Commissioner Jay had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| So I'd be in favor of denying this because you're kind of interrupting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| what is already designated for that community that has probably been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| place for, I'm guessing, probably 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| This is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| I'm very familiar with Birchfield Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| I am your commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| I went out twice and tried to catch you at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| You'll just have to ask for permission after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| I did walk through your carport and look around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| If I may, where is that garage apartment going to be located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| Okay, so the original lot was actually two lots that the previous owner had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| purchased, and then he combined them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| When you look at the house, it's the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| So it's downhill from the house to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| Yes, that was kind of what I envisioned when I saw there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| To your point, Commissioner Schoonmaker, if you drive out through that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| there are some folks out there that have got some storage buildings that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| nearly the size of another apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| It's kind of a mixture of homes and outbuildings, but I absolutely can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2904)|
| 0:48:37| envision what it is that you're trying to do and do not have an issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| what you're trying to do on your property in your subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| So I'd like to go ahead and request that we approve the rezoning from RAE to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| RA because it is, in fact, very consistent with what already exists in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| We have a motion on the floor by Hill, a second by Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2944)|

| 0:49:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=2953)|

| 0:50:25| What I'm looking at doing is dividing my property so that my son can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| to build a home with the price of houses now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| so it would just be one additional unit, and we would divide the property in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| so it would be two half-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| The total right now is one acre, so it would be divided in half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3045)|

| 0:51:25| So is planning still looking it up, or they agree with what the applicant is saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3085)|
| 0:51:33| I was looking at what was on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| I would trust the applicant to know what their utility providers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| There might have been just an error on the application itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Just so that the applicant realizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| this is in the urban growth boundary of the Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| and so there may be road improvements that may be required of you with this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| So I just want to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| It's a private road, so I'm a tenth of a mile off of Snyder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| and there's a home behind me, so there's no roads that would affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| That word may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| I just want to make you aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3134)|

| 0:52:19| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3146)|

| 0:52:28| I'd like to go ahead and make the recommendation that we approve this request from Agriculture to RA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3148)|
| 0:52:37| on the property located 1115 Kelly Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| It is consistent with the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3162)|

| 0:52:52| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3175)|

| 0:53:00| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| Item number 61, 7-F-23-RZ is a request of Sam Hargrove for rezoning from agricultural to RA low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3184)|
| 0:53:14| at 1412 Chert Pit Road, parcel ID 105114 in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| This was actually deferred last month because of failure of the applicant to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| Commissioner Oster, do you have any information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| I don't have any updates, and I actually wanted to ask Director Brooks, have we heard from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3216)|
| 0:53:45| We have not, but I know that our staff did follow up with Mr. Hargrove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| confirmed that the email was correct, and then sent another letter to them to let them know they needed to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| There again, we're still kind of at a loss, correct, on the number of what he's wanting to do, even?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3238)|
| 0:54:06| That is correct, besides what's in the—because it was passed on consent at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| We could make some speculation, but—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| Yeah, I'm kind of at a loss here since he's not shown up, he's not had any communication with me or planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3256)|
| 0:54:26| so I think this is where I can—I don't really feel like I need to defer it any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3266)|
| 0:54:35| So I think that I'll probably make a motion to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| Do I deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| No, I'm going to make a motion to deny—make sure I get it right—the RA zone because the applicant hasn't shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3284)|
| 0:54:59| and we have no further information on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Oh, perfect, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Excuse me, let her have the home run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| We have a motion by Oster, second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker, no comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| I was just going to reaffirm that yes, we need to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Proper motion is on the floor to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Seeing no other lights, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3329)|

| 0:55:46| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925-zoning?start=3348)|
