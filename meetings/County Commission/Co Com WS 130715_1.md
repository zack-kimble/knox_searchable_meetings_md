| 2:49:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10169)|
| 2:49:30| I would simply respond by saying this is about as equal an opportunity as it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10170)|
| 2:49:36| Every student in the Knox County schools has an equal shot at achieving a seat in this career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10176)|
| 2:49:43| and technical education magnet school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| And if there are more applicants than there are seats available, then we do a lottery by geographic region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10185)|
| 2:49:51| like we did with the L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| And that every student, therefore, has, you know, the equal opportunity and appropriate opportunity to be able to access this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10193)|
| 2:50:01| what I think is going to be a great and wonderful opportunity, educational opportunity for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10201)|
| 2:50:07| And I know this is your all's job is to ask questions and scrutinize, but this is really good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10207)|
| 2:50:15| This is exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| This is really our fulfilling a promise that's in our strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10216)|
| 2:50:21| and we want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure it's a great opportunity for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10221)|
| 2:50:25| But this really is going to help us, as with the Gates Foundation grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10225)|
| 2:50:28| to really help us to provide a truly outstanding education to our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10228)|
| 2:50:32| And so I appreciate the support of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10232)|
| 2:50:38| Ms. Sprouls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| I think this is fabulous, and congratulations on doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| And I am so glad that the magnet program is expanding because I think it's a great program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| and I don't think we've got enough magnet schools happening in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10249)|
| 2:50:54| So thank you for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10258)|
| 2:50:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10259)|
| 2:51:00| I just want to point out the fact that I believe that a lottery for grammar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10260)|
| 2:51:07| or in this case high school would be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10267)|
| 2:51:15| You could have that for college education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| but when we had guaranteed a child an education up to their certain age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10277)|
| 2:51:22| you can't have a lottery and cut anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| If we're talking about a legal question, I would beg to differ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| and certainly we could ask for the law director to weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| But being able to set the parameters of enrollment in a school system is legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10293)|
| 2:51:41| within the purview of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10301)|
| 2:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| Motion before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10311)|
| 2:51:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10314)|
| 2:51:55| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10315)|
| 2:52:10| Item number 26, resolution 212.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10330)|
| 2:52:13| It's approving a master lease purchase agreement with Apple Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| in the amount of $5,946,352 to be paid over a four-year term for the acquisition of devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10336)|
| 2:52:25| for the school technology challenge, first year funding in current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10345)|
| 2:52:32| Okay, hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10352)|
| 2:52:33| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10358)|
| 2:52:43| We're going with Apple, which the school system, as everybody knows, has been Shanghai,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10363)|
| 2:52:51| commandeered, whatever, into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10371)|
| 2:52:53| In the age of this century, when we can put a man on the moon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10373)|
| 2:52:59| we can have a guy sitting in an office out in New Mexico and punch a button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| and put a missile down the smokestack of a shack on the side of a hill in Iraq,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10384)|
| 2:53:09| that we can't get two different companies' computers to talk to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10389)|
| 2:53:13| Now, we're going with Apple, I'm assuming, because that's what all the systems are designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10393)|
| 2:53:21| Why can't we get a Dell computer to talk to an Apple computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10401)|
| 2:53:27| For less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10407)|
| 2:53:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10408)|
| 2:53:29| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| You know, honestly, we had a lot of discussion about the particular choice of device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10411)|
| 2:53:37| for the school technology challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| And to be honest with you, you know, I push pretty hard on our school folks about this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10419)|
| 2:53:45| to make sure that we get the best machine for the best value that is going to best be able to help them provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10425)|
| 2:53:54| creative, innovative, differentiated instruction for our kids so that we meet the needs of all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10434)|
| 2:53:59| Those who are struggling, those who are doing okay, and those who are excelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| And so we convened the principals and some of the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10443)|
| 2:54:10| and the leadership team from the 11 school technology schools, including South Tooe High School and Bonnie Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10450)|
| 2:54:18| And it was really their very strong recommendation that this was the right device to move forward with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10458)|
| 2:54:25| in terms of their ability to utilize it to enhance instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| So we had lots of conversation over a period of several months looking at the instructional tools that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10470)|
| 2:54:38| and what technology would best support those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| And this is what came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| I actually use a Lenovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| I'm a PC guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10485)|
| 2:54:46| I'm not an Apple guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10486)|
| 2:54:47| But this is what the teachers and the school leaders in the 11 school technology challenge schools really strongly recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10487)|
| 2:54:59| in terms of the device because they thought this is what would best support their ability to personalize learning for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10499)|
| 2:55:06| And that's what the school technology challenge is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| Is it worth twice as much money as you could get out of a Dell or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10509)|
| 2:55:16| So this is a we got a fairly deep discount from Apple, given the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10516)|
| 2:55:22| Dell 569 or some figure, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10522)|
| 2:55:26| Yeah, well, I mean, it's still the cost of the device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10526)|
| 2:55:29| I think it's $817 per device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10529)|
| 2:55:31| It's still a significant sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| But, again, this is the device that in terms of a variety of factors, in terms of functionality, durability, ease of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10533)|
| 2:55:43| and accessibility, which is important for many of our kids, and comparability in terms of being able to utilize the type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10543)|
| 2:55:53| of instructional software that's important, those are the factors that the group looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10553)|
| 2:56:00| and came back with a strong recommendation toward this machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10560)|
| 2:56:04| It's a MacBook Pro, and it is a 13-inch device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10564)|
| 2:56:08| This is what we use for our upper elementary school, middle school, and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10568)|
| 2:56:12| Of course, at the early elementary level, we're talking about using the iPad as the learning device of choice there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10572)|
| 2:56:18| But it was a strong recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10578)|
| 2:56:20| And, again, I spent a lot of time with Mr. Barry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| and with others talking through and with his team and with the teams from across the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10583)|
| 2:56:30| talking about which device would best support what we're trying to accomplish instructionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10590)|
| 2:56:35| with the school technology challenge, and this was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| The other thing that you see in this agreement is that we're able to basically pay for the device over a four-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10597)|
| 2:56:45| And as part of their practice, Apple is willing to buy back the device after three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10605)|
| 2:56:53| or four years for its residual value, which oftentimes can be as much as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10613)|
| 2:56:59| a fifth to a fourth of the original purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10619)|
| 2:57:03| And so there's some real advantages to the structure of this agreement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10623)|
| 2:57:11| Well, it's hard for me to believe, and I'm not a computer geek and be the first one to admit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10631)|
| 2:57:18| that an $800 computer is, when you're talking about something that's going to be used in an educational program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10638)|
| 2:57:28| is going to be doing twice as much good as a $300 computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10648)|
| 2:57:34| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10654)|
| 2:57:35| And just to mention, the discount that we negotiated was $272 per machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10655)|
| 2:57:40| So we really pushed hard on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| That's the discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10662)|
| 2:57:43| That's not the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| That's the discount, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| Still $569 per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| $817, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| After?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| $817 after discount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10672)|
| 2:57:54| Holy moly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10674)|
| 2:57:58| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| The price of gas is pretty high, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10680)|
| 2:58:05| You know, I guess my question to you on that one is more, so we've got 11 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10685)|
| 2:58:13| What's the breakdown of, maybe unfair question, high, middle, elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10693)|
| 2:58:20| I believe we have two high schools, two middle schools, and the rest are elementary, I believe, is the breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10700)|
| 2:58:27| And back to the other point, at the end of the year or third of the year, a year, halfway through the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10707)|
| 2:58:34| what are your metrics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10714)|
| 2:58:35| How are you going to reach out there and measure its effectiveness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| I mean, I know you're just not going to look at TCAP scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| Do you all have any ways that you're thinking about along the way seeing how these, what type of schools you call them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10721)|
| 2:58:50| Challenge schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10730)|
| 2:58:51| School technology challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10731)|
| 2:58:52| Yeah, school technology challenge schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| Yeah, so in order to be selected for the school technology challenge, these 11 schools had to outline their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10733)|
| 2:59:00| and what they wanted to be able to accomplish and moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10740)|
| 2:59:06| You know, the basics of it are around how we, and the terminology that I've been using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10746)|
| 2:59:12| how we personalize learning for each student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10752)|
| 2:59:14| How do we, in a classroom of 25 kids, make sure that we're meeting the needs of each individual one of those students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10754)|
| 2:59:21| And there's another item, I don't know if it's on this agenda or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| that the school board just approved the other day, which is a learning management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10764)|
| 2:59:28| And that is an electronic software system that helps us to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10768)|
| 2:59:33| and differentiate instruction for those students that are in the same classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| so that you're providing appropriate support and educational learning activities for students who are struggling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10777)|
| 2:59:43| those who are doing okay, and those who are excelling, all in the same classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10783)|
| 2:59:46| That's a very complex and sophisticated task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| Our teachers do it enormously well, but this is another tool for them to be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10789)|
| 2:59:53| So some of what we're looking toward are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| I guess the leading indicators are going to be sort of the culture around the utilization of technology to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10796)|
| 3:00:04| individualized learning and our implementation of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10804)|
| 3:00:09| And then ultimately it's about student learning and success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| It's about did we see growth in terms of student academic learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10812)|
| 3:00:17| and looking at those metrics that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| So, you know, again, I think we need to look at how did instruction change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10820)|
| 3:00:26| How did we change our ability to differentiate within the same classroom, the teaching that we provide to our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10826)|
| 3:00:33| But then also I think ultimately it's going to be about did our kids learn more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| Did they learn deeper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10837)|
| 3:00:38| Did they learn better at the end of the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| And that's what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10840)|
| 3:00:42| It's about student academic achievement and student academic growth and student learning and success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10842)|
| 3:00:48| And, you know, I'll end with, I don't know how long I've had this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| but shortly after coming on the commission in 2008, the county bought me a MacBook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10852)|
| 3:00:58| and it's been over five years and it's still state of the art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10858)|
| 3:01:03| So there's something to be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10863)|
| 3:01:04| I've dealt with a lot of Dells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10864)|
| 3:01:05| I've dealt with a lot of other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| But in terms of being able to process over a long period of time and keep up with software upgrades, operating system upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10867)|
| 3:01:14| I applaud the decision to stick with something that's been proven to be a really strong platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10874)|
| 3:01:21| When you're dealing with sending these things out in thousands of different directions, this makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10881)|
| 3:01:27| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10887)|
| 3:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10890)|

| 3:01:55| They're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10915)|
| 3:01:56| They're well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10916)|
| 3:01:57| Are we going to go to our pension thing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10917)|

| 3:04:17| Go ahead, Mr. Caldwell, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| Go ahead, and I'll ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| Second, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11062)|
| 3:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11063)|
| 3:04:24| We would request that you send this on currently with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11064)|
| 3:04:27| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11067)|
| 3:04:28| We're still getting our numbers straight between the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11068)|
| 3:04:34| and property official's office in verifying the amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| and so we would just ask you to sit on with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11078)|
| 3:04:42| until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| I'll make a change in my first motion to no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11084)|
| 3:04:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11089)|
| 3:04:50| Agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11090)|
| 3:04:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11091)|
| 3:04:52| Mr. Shouse, do you want to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| Chris, why or I certainly support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11094)|
| 3:04:56| and I think I know Buzz has worked on it for years down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11096)|
| 3:05:00| and it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11100)|
| 3:05:01| It's a fairly productive recycling center down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11101)|
| 3:05:04| and it's parking and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| Why don't you choose the pilot instead of a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11106)|
| 3:05:13| Or I mean, can you or is that a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| should I ask Mark Memento or somebody that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11115)|
| 3:05:18| I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11118)|
| 3:05:20| Well, financing really wasn't the issue on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11120)|
| 3:05:25| The issue on this project is that we have to build a parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11127)|
| 3:05:28| We're building a 350-page parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11128)|
| 3:05:30| Buzz, will you give your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11130)|
| 3:05:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11132)|
| 3:05:33| Sorry, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11133)|
| 3:05:34| Buzz Goss, 110 West Summit Hill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11134)|
| 3:05:38| Sort of a public use project, that being the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11138)|
| 3:05:42| or it won't be public, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11142)|
| 3:05:43| will it just be apartment dwellers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11146)|
| 3:05:47| It would be taking the property that we have under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| thanks to the kind of commission here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| to build this on and, but the TIF doesn't quite work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11152)|
| 3:05:59| I don't know how you would use it in a project like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| Okay, and five or six items later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11162)|
| 3:06:04| we've got the TIF for JCPenney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11164)|
| 3:06:08| The guy's borrowing 3.2 and asking for a 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11168)|
| 3:06:11| 1 million, 150 TIF on a totally different project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11171)|
| 3:06:15| Yours is rental apartments in a parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11177)|
| 3:06:18| I am no longer involved in the JCPenney building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11178)|
| 3:06:20| I sold my interest in that to David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| That's a Dewhurst, I assume, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11183)|
| 3:06:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11184)|
| 3:06:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11185)|
| 3:06:26| I just wondered academically, and I'll ask Mamentov for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11186)|
| 3:06:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11189)|
| 3:06:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| Okay, other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11192)|
| 3:06:36| Okay, the motion is no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11196)|

| 3:07:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11225)|
| 3:07:06| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11228)|
| 3:07:09| Wouldn't this have to come before number 110 on the meeting on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11229)|
| 3:07:16| If you're approving the process, wouldn't this need to process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11236)|
| 3:07:19| This needs to be before 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11239)|
| 3:07:24| We're going to put an agenda back together for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11244)|
| 3:07:29| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11249)|
| 3:07:30| That's what the law director just informed us of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11250)|
| 3:07:38| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11258)|
| 3:07:39| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| Then will the new trustee be sworn in right then and there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11261)|
| 3:07:44| Will that be done here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11264)|
| 3:07:45| Where will that be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11265)|
| 3:07:46| Mr. Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11266)|
| 3:07:52| Currently, it would be at the discretion of whoever you elect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| Sometimes they want to have their families and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11275)|
| 3:07:58| and nobody knows who that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| And, you know, you could end up if everybody with anticipation came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11281)|
| 3:08:05| we had 25 and they brought their, you know, families in anticipation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11285)|
| 3:08:10| So I would say it would probably happen at a later time because you're still under a trustee oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11290)|
| 3:08:16| You have to have election and bond in their oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11296)|
| 3:08:21| So we would have to then apply for the bond like we're going through with the chief deputy now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11301)|
| 3:08:26| successor trustee, interim successor trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| So I don't know that it will happen on Tuesday in terms of them taking an oath of office, but it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11310)|
| 3:08:39| I just don't know the answer to that because I don't know who you're going to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11319)|
| 3:08:42| or who will be ready or what their pleasure will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11322)|
| 3:08:47| But even if we put them in immediately on that date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11327)|
| 3:08:51| we still have to wait for their bond for the fulfillment of the oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11331)|
| 3:08:55| So they're still going to be kind of in limbo until the bond comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11335)|
| 3:09:01| So they're not actively trustee until their bond and their swearing takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11341)|
| 3:09:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11346)|
| 3:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11347)|
| 3:09:08| Once they have the authority to act on behalf of Knox County with a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11348)|
| 3:09:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11352)|
| 3:09:19| Who does the bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11359)|
| 3:09:24| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11364)|
| 3:09:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11366)|
| 3:09:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11367)|
| 3:09:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11368)|
| 3:09:29| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11369)|
| 3:09:33| Page 18, item number 66, resolution 904,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11373)|
| 3:09:38| approving a tax increment financing amendment to the Gay Street redevelopment and urban renewal plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11378)|
| 3:09:44| as prepared by Knoxville's Community Development Corporation for the redevelopment of real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11384)|
| 3:09:48| located at 412, 414, and 416 South Gay Street, commonly known as the J.C. Penney Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11388)|
| 3:09:58| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11398)|
| 3:09:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11399)|
| 3:10:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| Mr. Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11402)|
| 3:10:03| I was just going to say I certainly support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| This place has been sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| I had a tarp over it for five or six years, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11407)|
| 3:10:12| It took a lot of background work and hard work from, I know Buzz was in it, as he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11412)|
| 3:10:22| but Mr. Dewhurst and others are in it now and I hope they can move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11422)|
| 3:10:27| And it's the last piece of the puzzle, I believe, to that block of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11427)|
| 3:10:31| Mass General is there and the brewery place is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11431)|
| 3:10:34| It was not the last because Joe Petri's got the old Arby's building just to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11434)|
| 3:10:40| But anyway, I certainly support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11440)|
| 3:10:42| And if even though it does cost Knox County $45,000 a year, I think it's certainly worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11442)|
| 3:10:51| Chris, would you speak to the TIF 10-year versus 20-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11451)|
| 3:10:57| Yeah, it's got a maximum amount on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| I can't remember the amount right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11459)|
| 3:11:03| And so we'll pay up to a certain amount, whether it's 10 years or 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11463)|
| 3:11:09| I forget the amount right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11469)|
| 3:11:12| And this was brought to us by the city, I think, in the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11472)|
| 3:11:17| And so this is just getting worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11477)|
| 3:11:19| So it will go to council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| So I think the timing was added late and that is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11481)|
| 3:11:25| But we pay up to a certain amount and not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11485)|
| 3:11:29| And I think the city's amounts, they're both combined to be a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11489)|
| 3:11:35| I'll have that number for you on Monday if I don't have it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| All right, other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11501)|
| 3:11:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11504)|
| 3:11:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11505)|
| 3:11:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11506)|
| 3:11:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11507)|
| 3:11:48| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| Page 19, item 67, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11511)|
| 3:11:55| It's number one, directing the Knox County finance director to submit to Knoxville City Council's action of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11515)|
| 3:12:03| to hold on implementing the city county building garage monthly parking rate increase effective January 1, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11523)|
| 3:12:10| to $60 for Knox County employees paying the full rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| and $30 for those employees paying the 50 percent rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| And number two, requesting the city county PBA parking committee to reconvene subject to Knoxville City Council's action of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11537)|
| 3:12:25| as recommended in the city county PBA parking committee report dated May 18, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11545)|
| 3:12:31| to review the parking rate and structure and other matters affecting parking policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11551)|
| 3:12:36| and submit its findings and recommendations to the County Commission, City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11556)|
| 3:12:41| Board of Education, and PBA Board of Directors for their consideration and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11561)|
| 3:12:48| Okay, do we have a motion, Ms. Boyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11570)|
| 3:12:54| Motion to approve, I assume, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11574)|
| 3:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11577)|
| 3:12:58| Okay, and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11578)|
| 3:13:00| Actually, I'd like to, I'm sorry, I'd like to ask Chris about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11580)|
| 3:13:06| And do we, Chris, do we need to delete that number two off of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11586)|
| 3:13:11| Because we decided before not to reconvene that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11591)|
| 3:13:18| Yeah, you could just take number two off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| Let's amend it, please, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11601)|
| 3:13:25| Okay, the second agree to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11605)|
| 3:13:29| Do we need to talk about the whole rest of that paragraph or just number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11609)|
| 3:13:32| No, just number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11612)|
| 3:13:34| We need the committee to reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| That is the rest of the paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11617)|
| 3:13:49| This, we can't do anything by ourselves, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11629)|
| 3:13:55| This has to be done in conjunction with, you know, in agreement with City Council, PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11635)|
| 3:14:01| and all that kind of good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11641)|
| 3:14:04| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| My thinking was, Chris, has anybody put any figures together recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11647)|
| 3:14:13| I know we had talks back in November that you had a bunch that you were trying to get moved around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11653)|
| 3:14:22| and so forth to create some more spaces here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11662)|
| 3:14:29| Have we had any luck in that avenue or are we still kind of where we were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11669)|
| 3:14:36| I don't think we're ready to make a decision here without knowing, you know, more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| Maybe we need to have a committee sit down with you and possibly PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11681)|
| 3:14:47| Yeah, basically after the committee adjourned, I think Commissioner Smith was on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11687)|
| 3:14:56| we basically said from that point forth, you know, both mayors could decide what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11696)|
| 3:15:03| I've currently got an employee in my office, Jason Lay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11703)|
| 3:15:06| He's going to be working with the city in getting county vehicles moved over to the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11706)|
| 3:15:12| They're going to let us use that spot for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11712)|
| 3:15:14| We're getting a vehicle count from PBA over a weekend of how many government vehicles are in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11714)|
| 3:15:21| At one point it was as many as 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11721)|
| 3:15:24| I think the last check was 40 or 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| And so it's getting those vehicles moved over and that frees up some spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11727)|
| 3:15:32| I think as we go to talk about meeting with the legislative delegation before they go back to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11732)|
| 3:15:41| there's a couple of things that I would like to talk to them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11741)|
| 3:15:45| One of those being amending the TCA code to address our issues with handicap parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11745)|
| 3:15:53| And McGee-Tyson Airport has done it via TCA code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11753)|
| 3:15:58| I think we can do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11758)|
| 3:16:00| And we just need to get them to amend that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| There's a PBA code in TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11763)|
| 3:16:06| There's a public building authority code in TCA that would allow us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11766)|
| 3:16:10| We could put some language in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11770)|
| 3:16:12| And then that fixes a revenue issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11772)|
| 3:16:16| I mean, it's an issue when there's 120 handicap parkers under the county and there is 10 under the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11776)|
| 3:16:26| There's some people who are really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11786)|
| 3:16:32| They're just beating the system, if I can have a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11792)|
| 3:16:35| And so it's things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11795)|
| 3:16:38| So we need to talk to our legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11798)|
| 3:16:41| Jason will work with Jim York, and we'll get our vehicles over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| It's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11805)|
| 3:16:46| And it's not an easy process because getting people to know that those people are going to get moved over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11806)|
| 3:16:53| then as you're leaving the building, if it's like a codes inspector, drive your personal vehicle from here to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11813)|
| 3:17:00| And then, you know, it's because you're taking up two spots here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11820)|
| 3:17:04| And so that's why we have an overcrowding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11824)|
| 3:17:10| But I think to answer Commissioner Brown's question, we can do it without reconvening the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11830)|
| 3:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11837)|
| 3:17:19| Do we need to postpone this for some time then until you get all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11839)|
| 3:17:26| I think if you defer, like it's saying, until January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11846)|
| 3:17:32| In our budget this year, we just put a budget in there as it was constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11852)|
| 3:17:38| We didn't include an increase as far as revenue goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11858)|
| 3:17:42| So that's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11862)|
| 3:17:44| Give us until January 1 to get government vehicles moved over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11864)|
| 3:17:48| and then at that time we would have met with our delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11868)|
| 3:17:52| and see if they would put forth a change in TCA code for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11872)|
| 3:17:56| This change you're talking about would be to charge handicaps to park then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11876)|
| 3:18:01| Yeah, it sounds bad, I know, but it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11881)|
| 3:18:06| No, the airport does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11886)|
| 3:18:07| You mentioned that a while ago, and it's not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11887)|
| 3:18:10| Yeah, and so basically what happens now is I'll just use an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11890)|
| 3:18:16| If me and Hugh Holt have the same job and I have asthma, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11896)|
| 3:18:22| I can actually get a doctor's excuse from my doctor and get handicapped parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11902)|
| 3:18:27| I can park for free, but he has to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11907)|
| 3:18:31| I think there's an issue there myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11911)|
| 3:18:34| So, Mr. Chairman, can we just defer this then until January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11914)|
| 3:18:38| since it didn't make a change in this year's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11918)|
| 3:18:43| We don't need to address this until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| We can just postpone it until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11927)|
| 3:18:48| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11928)|
| 3:18:49| That's what I prefer to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11929)|
| 3:18:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11930)|
| 3:18:51| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11931)|
| 3:18:52| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11932)|
| 3:18:53| Then we need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11933)|
| 3:18:54| Yeah, that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11934)|
| 3:18:55| Motion to defer until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| This is a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| It's a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11940)|
| 3:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11941)|
| 3:19:02| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11942)|
| 3:19:03| Defer the whole issue until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11943)|
| 3:19:06| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11948)|
| 3:19:09| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11949)|
| 3:19:10| Chris, can you have PBA here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11950)|
| 3:19:13| I don't care to do this, but I'd like to hear what PBA has to say on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11953)|
| 3:19:17| Can they come speak to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| I'll see if I can get Dale or Gene here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11959)|
| 3:19:21| Yeah, just somebody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11961)|
| 3:19:22| Just get their feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11962)|
| 3:19:23| If they don't have a problem with it, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11965)|
| 3:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11968)|
| 3:19:29| That's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11969)|
| 3:19:30| Defer to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11971)|
| 3:19:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11972)|
| 3:19:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11973)|
| 3:19:34| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11974)|
| 3:19:41| We're on page 20, item number 69, resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11981)|
| 3:19:45| It's approving a grant contract in the amount of $425,000, no local match required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11985)|
| 3:19:51| with the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for the operation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11991)|
| 3:19:57| Knox County Drug Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=11997)|
| 3:20:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12000)|
| 3:20:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12001)|
| 3:20:03| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12003)|
| 3:20:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12006)|
| 3:20:07| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| The next item is number 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12009)|
| 3:20:11| It's an ordinance 101, and I'll be reading the revised version of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12011)|
| 3:20:15| And this is also an emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| It's an emergency ordinance amending Knox County Code, Chapter 34, Article 1, to designate appropriate flood hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12017)|
| 3:20:27| maps and amend the definition of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12027)|
| 3:20:30| This amends Ordinance O-07-2-102, Subsection 1, Exhibit A, adopted April 16, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12030)|
| 3:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12040)|
| 3:20:41| This is an emergency ordinance, so it passes on one reading, and it has two-thirds vote required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12041)|
| 3:20:47| And so do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12047)|
| 3:20:50| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12050)|
| 3:20:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12051)|
| 3:20:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12052)|
| 3:20:53| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12053)|
| 3:20:54| Mr. Grange, you come down and kind of give us the plain English version of what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12054)|
| 3:21:02| Why it's an emergency ordinance for one thing and what it entails, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12062)|
| 3:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12067)|
| 3:21:08| Chris, give the name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12068)|
| 3:21:10| I'm Chris Grangeau, 205 West Baxter Avenue, Knox County stormwater director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12070)|
| 3:21:19| It's an emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| We've been working with FEMA for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12081)|
| 3:21:24| Maybe I should back up and answer that in reverse order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12084)|
| 3:21:28| What these changes are is basically every time new flood maps are generated for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12088)|
| 3:21:34| FEMA requires that the ordinance itself has the date of the maps in the language of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12094)|
| 3:21:39| It can't just say reference the current maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12099)|
| 3:21:42| It actually has to have the map date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12102)|
| 3:21:43| So their new maps are becoming effective August 5th of this year, August 5th, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12103)|
| 3:21:49| And so there's a requirement that Section 34-5 is changed from May 2nd, 2007 to August 5th, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12109)|
| 3:22:00| Along the way, also, there's a definition section, which is 34-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12120)|
| 3:22:07| There is language, and this is something that just came up, I guess, a week ago from FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12127)|
| 3:22:15| for their required language for any community that participates in the National Flood Insurance Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12135)|
| 3:22:21| But they told us that we have to strike the word permanent from the definition of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12141)|
| 3:22:28| And in a sense, it probably frees up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12148)|
| 3:22:31| It pushes our ordinance away from forcing people to build permanent structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12151)|
| 3:22:36| or if anything, it probably frees up the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12156)|
| 3:22:39| But those two changes are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12159)|
| 3:22:43| Now, as far as the need for the timing, this is something we've been working with FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12163)|
| 3:22:49| and the remapping process for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12169)|
| 3:22:52| And until really the end of or the middle of last month, about a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12172)|
| 3:22:59| we were told that we had to have the intent to pass an ordinance basically in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12179)|
| 3:23:06| In other words, if it were on a second reading in the August agenda, we'd be fine with FEMA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12186)|
| 3:23:14| And then about the same time we got the second definition word from FEMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12194)|
| 3:23:18| somebody else from FEMA told us that, no, they want to see it passed by August 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12198)|
| 3:23:25| Apparently they've had some problems with communities not passing an ordinance on good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12205)|
| 3:23:30| or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| I won't elaborate, but there's been a lot of personnel changes with FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12212)|
| 3:23:36| And this has been we do this every so often as map changes are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12216)|
| 3:23:40| This is just basically a road process that we go through as maps are updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12220)|
| 3:23:44| This year has been particularly onerous due to a lot of personnel changes with FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12224)|
| 3:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12231)|
| 3:23:52| Thank you, Mr. Granger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| Have any affected property owners been notified of their changes or if they're, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12234)|
| 3:23:59| and I'm just trying to learn a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| If somebody's property becomes into the floodplain or becomes more into the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12241)|
| 3:24:07| are they notified of that prior to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12247)|
| 3:24:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12249)|
| 3:24:14| But it wouldn't change anything if it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12254)|
| 3:24:17| Does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12257)|
| 3:24:18| Are they aware that if they become into the floodplain and they talk about flood insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12258)|
| 3:24:25| So we don't make any notifications at all to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12265)|
| 3:24:28| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12268)|
| 3:24:29| That's not part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| We need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12271)|
| 3:24:32| Does it go into the property records and the retention of deeds or MPC or things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12272)|
| 3:24:37| The KGIS, I guess it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12277)|
| 3:24:39| The KGIS maps are updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| Usually it would come into effect if the property changes hands, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12281)|
| 3:24:48| With more recent changes, you'll notice this is a five-year, six-year period technically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12288)|
| 3:24:55| The changes are a lot less dramatic with shorter periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| I think a few years ago we were doing a map change and it had been almost 20, 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12298)|
| 3:25:04| In that case, you have some dramatic changes in floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| Over a few years, you really don't have as dramatic a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12310)|
| 3:25:14| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| So I think what I'm hearing is this is going to be like a new normal then with y'all having to get these dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12316)|
| 3:25:25| Are we going to continually have these emergency ordinances come up as you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12325)|
| 3:25:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| I think it's clear unless FEMA, sometimes they're a little hard to get information from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12333)|
| 3:25:40| But this was a case of, I guess, conflicting information regarding the timing from FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12340)|
| 3:25:45| So we do anticipate any time flood maps are changed that we will be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12345)|
| 3:25:50| and asking for an ordinance revision to reflect the new map dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12350)|
| 3:25:54| But we will do that in ample time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12354)|
| 3:25:57| Chris, could you give a hypothetical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| All right, say somebody's living on Beaver Creek and that would be an area that the flood maps would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12359)|
| 3:26:09| Is that inaccurate in some parts of Beaver Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12369)|
| 3:26:14| You know, I don't think Beaver Creek is actually changing in this map revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12374)|
| 3:26:21| Okay, give us a watershed then where there's dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12381)|
| 3:26:25| Is there some that's got a dramatic change in the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12385)|
| 3:26:29| There's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12389)|
| 3:26:30| Generally, what we've had is areas where there have been what are known as approximate flood areas in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12390)|
| 3:26:37| Those are areas that are just shaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| They don't have a lot of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| And usually these map changes are when they go in and they add detail to those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12401)|
| 3:26:47| In those cases, it actually can have a beneficial effect in terms of flood insurance rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12407)|
| 3:26:52| It actually gives more detail where before there was no detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12412)|
| 3:26:56| Okay, so you see this to the property owner as an advantage to the property owner in terms of flood insurance coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12416)|
| 3:27:03| It's better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| Better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12425)|
| 3:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| All right, other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12428)|
| 3:27:10| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12430)|
| 3:27:11| Just explain how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12431)|
| 3:27:13| I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| I've got a building and it's inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12435)|
| 3:27:18| It's a four-story building and it's on pillars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| I've got one pillar that's in the flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12440)|
| 3:27:24| They make me have flood insurance worth $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12444)|
| 3:27:29| And they just redrew the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12449)|
| 3:27:32| If you've got somebody that you're changing something on and somebody has commercial or residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12452)|
| 3:27:40| and now they're in the flood plain, four years from now they have a claim because they're plagued with floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12460)|
| 3:27:47| I see the insurance company coming back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| we're not going to pay the claim because back in so-and-so, Knox County changed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12469)|
| 3:27:54| You're in the flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12474)|
| 3:27:56| I'm thinking we're hurting the property owner when we do this or the business owner by not notifying them where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12476)|
| 3:28:03| Am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12483)|
| 3:28:06| I'm not sure I can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12486)|
| 3:28:08| I just know that having the ordinance that reflects the current map date is really a requirement for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12488)|
| 3:28:15| for anybody to be eligible for flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12495)|
| 3:28:18| I think if we're changing on somebody, we owe it to them, Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12498)|
| 3:28:25| to let them know how their property is now zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12505)|
| 3:28:29| Because it makes a major difference in their insurance cost claims and future claims and whether or not they can build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12509)|
| 3:28:36| They think, oh, I can zone this and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| Six years later, they go to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| Oh, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12521)|
| 3:28:44| I got a piece of commercial property and told me all I could put next to it was a marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12524)|
| 3:28:49| I said, how many boats do you see going up First Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12529)|
| 3:28:54| And that's what you run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12534)|
| 3:28:57| So, anyway, I think we need to notify people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12537)|
| 3:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12541)|
| 3:29:02| Well, we've had a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12542)|
| 3:29:05| I think that there is an issue that's brought up about notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12545)|
| 3:29:08| I think we could address that at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12548)|
| 3:29:11| Hopefully that we, I don't know, that's definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12551)|
| 3:29:14| If your property changes in terms of designation about flood, that is a, that's a notable issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12554)|
| 3:29:23| But, anyway, do you have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| I'm wondering if we don't, Mr. Chairman, are we held liable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12565)|
| 3:29:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12568)|
| 3:29:30| Well, this is a current map update that's required by FEMA for us to satisfy their getting compliance with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12570)|
| 3:29:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12580)|
| 3:29:41| Any other questions for Mr. Gronshue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| We need to do a roll call on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12587)|
| 3:29:50| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12590)|

| 3:30:10| Commissioner Wright votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12610)|
| 3:30:11| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12611)|
| 3:30:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12612)|
| 3:30:13| Commissioner Brown votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12613)|
| 3:30:14| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12614)|

| 3:30:16| Commissioner Hammond votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12616)|
| 3:30:17| Commissioner Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12617)|
| 3:30:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12618)|
| 3:30:19| Commissioner Schaus votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12619)|
| 3:30:20| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12620)|

| 3:30:22| Commissioner Norman votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12622)|
| 3:30:23| You have ten aye votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12625)|
| 3:30:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12626)|
| 3:30:27| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12627)|
| 3:30:28| Thank you, Mr. Granger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12628)|
| 3:30:31| We'll talk some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12631)|
| 3:30:32| That would probably be a worthy conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| I'd like to get with you about that, you know, notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| Maybe some way the county could do that for the property owners that are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12639)|
| 3:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12643)|
| 3:30:44| There shouldn't be that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| Next item is number 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12646)|
| 3:30:48| It's ordinance 101, amending Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12648)|
| 3:30:53| Sections 2-768 and 2-828 to reflect Knox County's current non-discrimination policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12653)|
| 3:31:00| for the hiring and employment of Knox County government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12660)|
| 3:31:03| This amends Ordinance O-02-7-101 adopted August 26, 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12663)|
| 3:31:10| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12670)|
| 3:31:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12672)|
| 3:31:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12675)|
| 3:31:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12677)|
| 3:31:18| I have a question, I guess, for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12678)|
| 3:31:22| This is already in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12682)|
| 3:31:24| Why do we need to redo this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12684)|
| 3:31:27| Is this not what our SOP practices are, what we're stating here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12687)|
| 3:31:34| Kind of getting it redundant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12694)|
| 3:31:38| We're currently covered by the existing charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| However, what you're being asked here in this ordinance is whether you want to enumerate or further define.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12701)|
| 3:31:49| I think this is sexual discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12709)|
| 3:31:52| You can further define or enumerate any of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12712)|
| 3:31:57| But as far as a legal position right now, we're in compliance with both what we call common law as well as statutory law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12717)|
| 3:32:06| But, you know, it's totally up to this body as to how you want to address the language of your own ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12726)|
| 3:32:12| in addressing our compliance, I guess is the best way to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12732)|
| 3:32:16| I'm in the short of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12736)|
| 3:32:18| They're covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12738)|
| 3:32:19| What we're asking for in this ordinance is already covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12739)|
| 3:32:24| What we're asking for in this ordinance, we're in compliance with our existing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12744)|
| 3:32:33| But I think what you're asking for in this ordinance is to enumerate with specificity compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12753)|
| 3:32:44| Well, if it's already covered, why do we need to dot the I's and cross the T's when they're already in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12764)|
| 3:32:49| Well, that's entirely up to this body how you want to enumerate your compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12769)|
| 3:32:54| That's not a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12774)|
| 3:32:56| That's a policy question for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12776)|
| 3:33:03| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12783)|
| 3:33:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12784)|
| 3:33:05| One of the things that I look at whenever I see this is that it's sort of like, well, federal law takes care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12785)|
| 3:33:15| But this just offers to a person who may think or feels like they've been discriminated against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12795)|
| 3:33:25| it allows them another venue to take their grievance, that being locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12805)|
| 3:33:32| So even though we may have it in 40 places, so we can have it in one more place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12812)|
| 3:33:39| I'll support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12819)|
| 3:33:44| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12824)|
| 3:33:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12826)|
| 3:33:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12827)|

| 3:33:52| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12832)|
| 3:33:54| Almost got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12834)|
| 3:34:03| Item number 72, ordinance 102, is amending Knox County Code, chapter 4, article 1, entitled beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12843)|
| 3:34:11| to establish a new section 4-13 previously reserved to forbid the sale of beer for on-premises consumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12851)|
| 3:34:19| within 300 feet of residential dwellings, schools, and churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12859)|
| 3:34:23| This amends ordinance 0-09-3-107, adopted April 27, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12863)|
| 3:34:29| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12869)|
| 3:34:33| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12873)|

| 3:34:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12879)|

| 3:35:08| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12908)|
| 3:35:09| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12909)|
| 3:35:10| I was just talking to Mr. Braden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12910)|
| 3:35:12| And do you have your agenda set for the chairman's lunch next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12912)|
| 3:35:18| We've got room for Mr. Braden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12918)|
| 3:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12921)|
| 3:35:22| If I could just ask that this be put on that agenda, I think, you know, it's not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12922)|
| 3:35:27| to take long, but he's going to bring some information for us that I think would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12927)|
| 3:35:31| for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12931)|
| 3:35:32| That'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12932)|
| 3:35:36| Is that okay with you, Ms. Bonavita?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12936)|
| 3:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12938)|
| 3:35:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12941)|
| 3:35:42| Item 77 has already been heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12942)|
| 3:35:45| Item 78, line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12945)|
| 3:35:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12948)|
| 3:35:51| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12951)|
| 3:35:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12952)|
| 3:35:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12953)|
| 3:35:54| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12954)|
| 3:35:55| Item 79 was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| Discussion regarding commission employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12957)|
| 3:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12961)|
| 3:36:02| Go ahead, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12962)|
| 3:36:03| I saw the information here with regards to the Audit Committee recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12963)|
| 3:36:07| And this is not specific to any employee, but back when I was chairman of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12967)|
| 3:36:13| commission, there was an opportunity for me to look at commission employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12973)|
| 3:36:19| and I learned that there was a resolution that had been passed back in 2001, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12979)|
| 3:36:24| believe, with regards to commission employees stating that there was a process to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12984)|
| 3:36:30| through should there be any type of grievance against an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12990)|
| 3:36:34| And the law director at the time, as we were discussing all of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12994)|
| 3:36:38| employees, felt that the auditor fell under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| So Mr. Armstrong has looked into it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13002)|
| 3:36:45| And, Bud, I mean, sorry, Mr. Armstrong, if you would give us your interpretation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13005)|
| 3:36:50| commission employees and just what our obligations are under this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13010)|
| 3:36:55| and any ordinances that may have been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13015)|
| 3:36:58| And I believe they passed prior to my being on commission, so I'm not sure the exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13018)|
| 3:37:02| date, but it would have been before 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13022)|
| 3:37:05| So 2004, okay, is when it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| So could you fill us in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13027)|
| 3:37:12| Certainly the issue that we've been looking at, and I think the particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13032)|
| 3:37:16| topic that Commissioner Hammond is talking about, in this particular case in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13036)|
| 3:37:21| the personnel plan of commission, it says that county commissions employees will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13041)|
| 3:37:29| go through a particular process when they are basically being reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13049)|
| 3:37:34| They would have an appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| They'd go before a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13056)|
| 3:37:39| The question at hand that I was asked is, does the current auditor position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13059)|
| 3:37:45| are they an employee as defined by the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13065)|
| 3:37:50| In our code, in Ordinance Section 2-274, this body has created the auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13070)|
| 3:38:01| the audit department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13081)|
| 3:38:03| And in that, it says the head of the department will be the county auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13083)|
| 3:38:09| So that separates them from the standard employee position that we would find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13089)|
| 3:38:14| the employees within that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| Furthermore, as we see in Section 2-276 of the same series, it gives the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13097)|
| 3:38:27| removal requirements of the auditor or department head, and is defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13107)|
| 3:38:33| distinctly different from in 2-277, employees of the internal audit department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13113)|
| 3:38:43| So they're separated by the creation of the department, one as a auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13123)|
| 3:38:49| department head, and the other people are defined as employees of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13129)|
| 3:38:55| So it was distinctly enumerated when this body created this department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13135)|
| 3:39:02| that there would be employees as the employee handbook plan would address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13142)|
| 3:39:07| and a department head as the ordinance would address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13147)|
| 3:39:13| So I think we have two distinct different criteria here, and under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13153)|
| 3:39:18| charter, under the ordinances, the auditor is created as a department head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13158)|
| 3:39:24| and is removed by Section 2-276.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13164)|
| 3:39:29| And the other employees under 2-277 would fall under the compliance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13169)|
| 3:39:36| employee handbook as adopted by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13176)|
| 3:39:40| And that's the view of the way the law department looks at this issue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13180)|
| 3:39:45| employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13185)|
| 3:39:46| Commissioners themselves are not employees under the handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13186)|
| 3:39:53| Department heads are not employees under the handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13193)|
| 3:39:56| But all other, quote, employees under 2-277 are employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13196)|
| 3:40:02| So you have in the neighborhood somewhere around four employees of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13202)|
| 3:40:06| county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13206)|
| 3:40:07| Everybody else is either an appointed official or a department head or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13207)|
| 3:40:12| appointed officer, such as the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13212)|
| 3:40:16| So that's the distinction between the roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13216)|
| 3:40:19| So I guess bottom line is with regards to the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13219)|
| 3:40:22| So then is it an at-will situation where it can be replaced by, does it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13222)|
| 3:40:27| have to be a two-thirds vote or a simple vote of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13227)|
| 3:40:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13230)|
| 3:40:31| Under the rule, under 2-276, the commission must vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13231)|
| 3:40:39| In other words, the vote, if you vote, must be by a majority of the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13239)|
| 3:40:45| membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13245)|
| 3:40:46| So it's not just an eligibility to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13246)|
| 3:40:49| You know, you have to have a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13249)|
| 3:40:52| This was changed in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13252)|
| 3:40:55| It was originally by a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13255)|
| 3:40:58| But the ordinance had been amended since 2000, I believe, to 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13258)|
| 3:41:03| So the auditor may be removed by county commission, and that removal must be by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13263)|
| 3:41:10| a majority vote of the entire membership of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13270)|
| 3:41:14| So that's what the actual ordinance states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13274)|
| 3:41:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13277)|
| 3:41:20| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| According to our commission personnel plan, the authority to terminate rests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13282)|
| 3:41:30| solely in the personnel committee, which is the commission chair, director of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13290)|
| 3:41:36| human resources, chairman of Knox County Sheriff's Merit Assistance Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13296)|
| 3:41:43| That is correct for Knox County employees who are commission employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13303)|
| 3:41:49| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13309)|
| 3:41:50| Well, but in this case, he is an employee of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13310)|
| 3:41:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13315)|
| 3:41:56| By definition, he is a department head and is distinctly under the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13316)|
| 3:42:02| for admission, for hire, and removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13322)|
| 3:42:06| It is the same as other department heads throughout county government who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13326)|
| 3:42:11| not underneath the merit plan for the sheriff, who are not underneath the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13331)|
| 3:42:17| employee benefit plan for the mayor's department or any other department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13337)|
| 3:42:22| If you are an appointed person, you don't fall under that employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13342)|
| 3:42:28| statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13348)|
| 3:42:29| If you are a hired person, you fall under the employee statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13349)|
| 3:42:33| Our current auditor is an appointed person by ordinance with an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13353)|
| 3:42:41| standard for removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13361)|
| 3:42:44| The plan adopted by county commission is for all other employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13364)|
| 3:42:50| It is a very distinct difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13370)|
| 3:42:52| And you all as a body have defined that in your ordinance versus your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13372)|
| 3:42:58| personnel plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13378)|
| 3:43:00| So an appointed office does not fall underneath the personnel plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13380)|
| 3:43:06| A hired employee is an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13386)|
| 3:43:10| And the ordinance itself specifically defines the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13390)|
| 3:43:13| That is kind of what you all voted on in two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13393)|
| 3:43:17| Where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13397)|
| 3:43:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13400)|
| 3:43:21| Other discussion regarding the internal auditor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13401)|
| 3:43:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13404)|
| 3:43:25| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| Discussion regarding the meeting with the state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13408)|
| 3:43:32| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13412)|
| 3:43:33| I just want to see if the body thought that meeting last year was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13413)|
| 3:43:37| productive and wanted to attempt it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13417)|
| 3:43:39| And I'll get with the Honorable Ryan Haynes if you guys want us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13419)|
| 3:43:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13425)|
| 3:43:46| I'll co-host it with you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13426)|
| 3:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13430)|
| 3:43:51| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13431)|
| 3:43:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13432)|
| 3:43:53| I thought it was very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13433)|
| 3:43:54| And thank you for arranging it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13434)|
| 3:43:55| And is the same person available to cater this year that it was last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13435)|
| 3:43:59| time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13439)|
| 3:44:00| Food was outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13440)|
| 3:44:01| I'll ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13441)|
| 3:44:02| I'll ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13442)|
| 3:44:03| And also, would it be possible for us to maybe have some discussion before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13443)|
| 3:44:07| the meeting to see if we could come up with some specific things we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13447)|
| 3:44:10| to ask them about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13450)|
| 3:44:11| I know that there are some things maybe this body would like for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13451)|
| 3:44:15| to really discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13455)|
| 3:44:16| And if we could maybe have a discussion of that maybe at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13456)|
| 3:44:20| so that we could have maybe an agenda item and say here's our priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13460)|
| 3:44:24| list that we would really like for you to take back to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13464)|
| 3:44:27| Let's add that to our discussion, to the discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13467)|
| 3:44:30| You're talking about when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13470)|
| 3:44:32| September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13472)|
| 3:44:33| I would check with their schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13473)|
| 3:44:35| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13475)|
| 3:44:37| And then we'll probably get back and start co-mingling with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13477)|
| 3:44:39| attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13479)|
| 3:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13480)|
| 3:44:41| So we'll try to add that to a discussion item to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13481)|
| 3:44:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13485)|
| 3:44:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13486)|
| 3:44:47| That would be for August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13487)|
| 3:44:48| We'll see what their schedule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13488)|
| 3:44:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13491)|
| 3:44:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13492)|
| 3:44:53| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13493)|
| 3:44:54| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13494)|
| 3:44:55| Ms. Royles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13495)|
| 3:44:56| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13496)|
| 3:44:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13497)|
| 3:44:58| We're not quite done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13498)|
| 3:44:59| A discussion regarding the Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13499)|
| 3:45:05| Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13505)|
| 3:45:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13506)|
| 3:45:07| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13507)|
| 3:45:08| Let me speak first and say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13508)|
| 3:45:11| You just want an amen out of me then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13511)|
| 3:45:14| I want an amen out of my fellow commissioner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13514)|
| 3:45:18| Chairman Norman, Commissioner Smith, Brown and myself today, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13518)|
| 3:45:23| lunch at the Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13523)|
| 3:45:30| 215 Bearden Place, but that's really off North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13530)|
| 3:45:39| First Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13539)|
| 3:45:40| First Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13540)|
| 3:45:41| Not Broadway Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13541)|
| 3:45:42| Broadway Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13542)|
| 3:45:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13543)|
| 3:45:44| It's near Broadway Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13544)|
| 3:45:45| We had an excellent lunch and a program presented to them of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13545)|
| 3:45:49| which Commissioner Brown is going to recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13549)|
| 3:45:53| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13553)|
| 3:45:54| I thought I was just getting an amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13554)|
| 3:46:00| Most of you all know that this request, their request for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13560)|
| 3:46:06| funds has been before us on two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13566)|
| 3:46:10| This dates back to, and you all have a copy of the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13570)|
| 3:46:13| somewhere in your file 13 basket if you haven't already burned them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13573)|
| 3:46:17| or shredded them, from a previous mayor pledging X amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13577)|
| 3:46:24| dollars to the Senior Citizens Home Assistance Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13584)|
| 3:46:28| Mr. Brown, let me interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13588)|
| 3:46:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13590)|
| 3:46:31| I see Chris Colvin now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13591)|
| 3:46:32| I didn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13592)|
| 3:46:33| I just wanted to make sure he was here to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13593)|
| 3:46:37| And when we had a mayor changeover that kind of got swept under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13597)|
| 3:46:43| rug, we came back three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13603)|
| 3:46:47| We gave them, it must have been like $500,000 a year to get a $3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13607)|
| 3:46:53| million deal in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13613)|
| 3:46:56| Three years ago we gave them $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13616)|
| 3:46:58| We skipped a year and then we gave them $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13618)|
| 3:47:01| We skipped a year and then we gave them $10,000 on defined service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13621)|
| 3:47:05| contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13625)|
| 3:47:08| They've got a note due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13628)|
| 3:47:10| They raised money based on our commitment, our previous mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13630)|
| 3:47:14| commitment and this commission, previous commission's commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13634)|
| 3:47:18| for X amount of dollars to build the building they have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13638)|
| 3:47:24| You know, they've got a beautiful building and Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13644)|
| 3:47:27| and myself spent some time talking to some of the residents there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13647)|
| 3:47:30| and they're happy as clams in the ocean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13650)|
| 3:47:35| But they are in need of some money to pay for some interest on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13655)|
| 3:47:43| bond note plus the fact that this was a pledge to them and I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13663)|
| 3:47:51| personally that it should be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13671)|
| 3:47:54| In talking with Mr. Howell, the director there, he has spoken, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13674)|
| 3:47:58| think, with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13678)|
| 3:48:00| Chris can verify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13680)|
| 3:48:02| He said this year we might be able to, not that we can do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13682)|
| 3:48:06| $500,000, I think our balance is $521,000 and change, but that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13686)|
| 3:48:12| might possibly be able to do $150,000 to $200,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13692)|
| 3:48:16| So that's kind of where we are right now and that's kind of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13696)|
| 3:48:19| we'd like to bring back to the group in one of two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13699)|
| 3:48:25| As a one-time shot or with the condition in there that over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13705)|
| 3:48:30| next two years we, after this payment, over the next two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13710)|
| 3:48:36| we polish off the rest of that debt, which I consider the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13716)|
| 3:48:41| So that's kind of where we are right now and give you a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13721)|
| 3:48:44| And if you have any questions, I'm sure Chris can give us a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| more info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13729)|
| 3:48:50| Chris, would you respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13730)|
| 3:48:51| I know you're aware of the letter from Ragsdale, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13731)|
| 3:48:53| commitment, the shortfall that they have on their note, all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13733)|
| 3:48:57| stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13737)|
| 3:48:58| So what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13738)|
| 3:49:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13740)|
| 3:49:01| I would start by saying this, and I think I would defer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13741)|
| 3:49:07| law department on this, but this is what I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13747)|
| 3:49:11| Having a letter from a former mayor that wasn't approved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13751)|
| 3:49:16| commission, it's nice, but it's not really worth anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13756)|
| 3:49:21| The money was never appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| Having said that, they've talked to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13763)|
| 3:49:28| We're going to try to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13768)|
| 3:49:30| There's three or four groups that have these letters that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13770)|
| 3:49:35| you know, we're going to give you this and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13775)|
| 3:49:38| So we'll try to work with them and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13778)|
| 3:49:42| In the past, it's put us in a little bit of a bind because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13782)|
| 3:49:48| you know, it's put in the capital plan and you can't bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13788)|
| 3:49:54| something that you don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13794)|
| 3:49:56| So that's a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| So basically, yes, we're going to work with Shaw's and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13798)|
| 3:50:02| thinking anywhere between $150,000 or $200,000, see how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13802)|
| 3:50:07| end up this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13807)|
| 3:50:09| As you know, we talk a lot about budget surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13809)|
| 3:50:13| So we'll see where we end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13813)|
| 3:50:15| And I will be bringing the great list of designations probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13815)|
| 3:50:20| next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13820)|
| 3:50:21| And that should be one of the things on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13821)|
| 3:50:25| And talking to Tim, I think he's very happy that the mayor wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13825)|
| 3:50:31| to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13831)|
| 3:50:32| One of the other groups was the zoo and we're trying to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13832)|
| 3:50:35| helping them through motel funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13835)|
| 3:50:37| And that's a positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13837)|
| 3:50:39| And so we will make some progress there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13839)|
| 3:50:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13843)|
| 3:50:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13844)|
| 3:50:45| Did you have something else, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13845)|
| 3:50:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13847)|
| 3:50:48| So we just need to really wait then until you see how you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13848)|
| 3:50:54| going to come out, rather than put the law department through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13854)|
| 3:50:58| writing up a resolution to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13858)|
| 3:51:00| If you come out and say it's okay, or otherwise we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13860)|
| 3:51:02| to have to get a resolution and twist your arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13862)|
| 3:51:04| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13864)|
| 3:51:06| I would say that there's no reason to try to amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13866)|
| 3:51:09| current year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| Let's wait and do it through a designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13871)|
| 3:51:13| You mentioned it wasn't in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13873)|
| 3:51:17| I believe that if you check that next month's commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13877)|
| 3:51:23| notes, that you'll find that the designation was for the $3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13883)|
| 3:51:29| million to be paid out in a specific manner, which this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13889)|
| 3:51:35| former commission would have had to approve, which means it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13895)|
| 3:51:39| technically still in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13899)|
| 3:51:41| Here's where that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13901)|
| 3:51:45| It was in a five-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13905)|
| 3:51:47| You approve year one of a five-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13907)|
| 3:51:50| So it never got all five years approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13910)|
| 3:51:53| There's another issue beyond that in that we can't bond money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13913)|
| 3:51:59| for things that we don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13919)|
| 3:52:01| So we don't want to bond money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13921)|
| 3:52:03| We can't legally bond money for a building that we don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13923)|
| 3:52:07| So that wasn't the right thing to do, and we had to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13927)|
| 3:52:14| work in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13934)|
| 3:52:16| But you all only approve year one of a five-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13936)|
| 3:52:20| It's just one of those things where we give you a five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13940)|
| 3:52:23| look, but we say year one's all we're doing, and we can change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13943)|
| 3:52:27| years two through four as they come up, two through five as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13947)|
| 3:52:30| they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13950)|
| 3:52:32| So they see that they saw the three million, because I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13952)|
| 3:52:36| it was there, but we approve one year at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13956)|
| 3:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13961)|
| 3:52:42| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13962)|
| 3:52:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13963)|
| 3:52:44| And I understand where we are on all the technical dotting of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13964)|
| 3:52:48| I's and crossings of T's here in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13968)|
| 3:52:53| I believe that where we've got a great shortcoming is that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13973)|
| 3:52:59| through action, word, deed, promise, whatever you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13979)|
| 3:53:03| call it, we've got these people on a hook by saying we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13983)|
| 3:53:08| going to help them with money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13988)|
| 3:53:11| They went and actually borrowed the money based on what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13991)|
| 3:53:16| thought to be good faith from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13996)|
| 3:53:19| And I realize that to be not technically correct if I call on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=13999)|
| 3:53:24| the law director, but what I would like to see commission do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14004)|
| 3:53:29| over the next couple of years is fulfill our word and help these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14009)|
| 3:53:37| people get out from under a debt which is costing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14017)|
| 3:53:43| operating funds, which they are expending there, not just in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14023)|
| 3:53:50| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14030)|
| 3:53:51| We're talking about here in Knox County for a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14031)|
| 3:53:54| facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14034)|
| 3:53:57| I believe it would be something that is not based on what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14037)|
| 3:54:00| need is there on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14040)|
| 3:54:02| It's based on the need of what we as commission said we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14042)|
| 3:54:05| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14045)|
| 3:54:07| And I'd like to see it done in a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14047)|
| 3:54:10| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14050)|
| 3:54:11| You can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14051)|
| 3:54:12| You can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14052)|

| 3:54:15| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14057)|

| 3:54:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14063)|
| 3:54:24| That's all we've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14064)|
| 3:54:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14066)|
| 3:54:27| Ms. Royals, did you have an announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14067)|
| 3:54:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14069)|
| 3:54:30| Chairman's luncheon next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14070)|
| 3:54:33| I've had requests for no hominy and no liver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14073)|
| 3:54:37| So anything else that anybody wants or doesn't want, you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14077)|
| 3:54:40| to let me know before I decide what to either have catered or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14080)|
| 3:54:44| what to cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14084)|
| 3:54:45| And the Tennessee Children's Dance Ensemble will be here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14085)|
| 3:54:48| talk about their recent trip to Newtown, Connecticut, to dance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14088)|
| 3:54:51| for the school and the students up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14091)|
| 3:54:54| And they will fill us in about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14094)|
| 3:54:57| And they're also going to do a short performance for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14097)|
| 3:55:00| So we'll be in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14100)|
| 3:55:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14103)|
| 3:55:04| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14104)|
| 3:55:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14105)|
| 3:55:06| Commissioner Burrell, while we're engaged in the menu, liver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14106)|
| 3:55:11| and hominy is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14111)|
| 3:55:14| There is a second announcement I guess that we missed, I missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14114)|
| 3:55:19| earlier on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14119)|
| 3:55:20| We need to have a discussion item at full commission about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14120)|
| 3:55:24| the outcomes of the small joint committee, Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14124)|
| 3:55:31| County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14131)|
| 3:55:32| That small committee is met and we need to, we, the members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14132)|
| 3:55:36| that committee, need to bring the activity back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14136)|
| 3:55:40| and then also load up with whatever it is that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14140)|
| 3:55:43| take to the next small joint committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14143)|
| 3:55:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14146)|
| 3:55:47| So that needs to be a discussion item Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14147)|
| 3:55:49| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14149)|
| 3:55:50| We'll add that to the agenda on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14150)|
| 3:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14152)|
| 3:55:53| Seeing nothing else, let's take five minutes, five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14153)|
| 3:55:59| Oh, we need to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14159)|
| 3:56:01| Make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14161)|
| 3:56:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14163)|

| 3:56:07| Those ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14167)|
| 3:56:08| Let's sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14168)|
| 3:56:09| We'll be out for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14169)|
| 3:56:11| Let's let these guys set up and be back for our pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14171)|
| 3:56:14| workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14174)|
| 3:56:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14175)|
| 3:56:16| The pension board, the pension board office and all the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14176)|
| 3:56:27| that have worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14187)|
| 3:56:28| This has been a long project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14188)|
| 3:56:30| So let's go ahead and start with this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14190)|
| 3:56:35| Kim Bennett is here to kick us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14195)|
| 3:56:38| So thank you, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14198)|
| 3:56:40| Sorry we don't have better attendance in the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14200)|
| 3:56:43| We've obviously lost a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14203)|
| 3:56:46| But those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14206)|
| 3:56:47| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14207)|
| 3:56:48| Things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14208)|
| 3:56:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14209)|
| 3:56:50| Well, I know everyone's had a great time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14210)|
| 3:56:54| I mean, it's only 20 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14214)|
| 3:56:57| And you've just been here since 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14217)|
| 3:57:00| But I've got a lot of details to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14220)|
| 3:57:04| You need to be familiar about it before it actually will be on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14224)|
| 3:57:08| agenda for the commission to vote on in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14228)|
| 3:57:17| It's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14237)|
| 3:57:18| I don't know how to get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14238)|
| 3:57:21| I have hard copies for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14241)|
| 3:57:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14244)|
| 3:57:25| We have hard copies for you after the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14245)|
| 3:57:30| Evidently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14250)|
| 3:57:31| I don't know how to get it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14251)|
| 3:57:34| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14254)|
| 3:57:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14258)|
| 3:57:41| I thought it was on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14261)|
| 3:57:42| I'm sorry, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14262)|
| 3:57:45| I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14265)|
| 3:57:48| But we have hard copies for you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14268)|
| 3:57:52| What I'd like to do is to talk in two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14272)|
| 3:57:58| Go over the first phase of the presentation and ask for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14278)|
| 3:58:02| That doesn't mean you can't interrupt me in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14282)|
| 3:58:04| Because I may answer your question with the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14284)|
| 3:58:09| So if we can go through the first part of it and then actually stop and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14289)|
| 3:58:14| questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14294)|
| 3:58:15| So feel free to interrupt me if you feel like it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14295)|
| 3:58:21| But that's my strategy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14301)|
| 3:58:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14304)|
| 3:58:27| The new plan is called STAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14307)|
| 3:58:32| S-T-A-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14312)|
| 3:58:35| This is the proposed retirement plan for the new officers replacing UOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14315)|
| 3:58:43| which will be closed December 31st, 2013, to new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14323)|
| 3:58:50| STAR stands for Sheriff's Total Accumulation Retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14330)|
| 3:58:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14338)|
| 3:59:01| This is what is being put in based on the voters' ballot results in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14341)|
| 3:59:08| of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14348)|
| 3:59:11| The pension board and its subcommittee, the document committee, has spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14351)|
| 3:59:16| hours and hours and hours on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14356)|
| 3:59:21| We have come up with a planned document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14361)|
| 3:59:24| The pension board will be reading for second approval at next Monday's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14364)|
| 3:59:29| meeting for approval of the document and, therefore, bringing it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14369)|
| 3:59:33| commission in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14373)|
| 3:59:36| The goal with this plan is to comply with the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14376)|
| 3:59:42| As the charter was amended in November, our goal is to provide law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14382)|
| 3:59:47| enforcement with a retirement plan that will provide them with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14387)|
| 3:59:53| retirement, with a career here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14393)|
| 3:59:56| It will allow officers to retire at approximately age 57, including the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14396)|
| 4:00:02| ability to pay for pre-Medicare health insurance premiums, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14402)|
| 4:00:08| is astronomical if you're not yet eligible for Medicare A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14408)|
| 4:00:13| It also offers retirement benefits that are affordable to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14413)|
| 4:00:19| Some of you may have heard the word GASB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14419)|
| 4:00:23| There is new government accounting standards coming out that will require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14423)|
| 4:00:27| the county to accrue a very large liability on defined benefit plans, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14427)|
| 4:00:35| this will eliminate that accrual for the new plan, and it will also tighten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14435)|
| 4:00:41| up on the definition of officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14441)|
| 4:00:44| STAR is a tax-qualified defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14444)|
| 4:00:52| The uniform officer plan, UOP as you know it, was a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14452)|
| 4:00:59| This is a defined contribution plan which runs parallel in many areas to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14459)|
| 4:01:05| the current retirement system offered to the county and non-certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14465)|
| 4:01:11| school employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14471)|
| 4:01:13| The effective date of this will be January the 1st, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14473)|
| 4:01:17| This will be for people who are hired as an officer on or after January 1 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14477)|
| 4:01:25| 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14485)|
| 4:01:27| Now, those who are in the UOP plan now will remain in the UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14487)|
| 4:01:36| Eligibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14496)|
| 4:01:37| Officers first employed or last re-employed as a full-time officer on or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14497)|
| 4:01:44| after January 1, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14504)|
| 4:01:47| So if the officer has been in the UOP, left UOP prior to January 1, 2014, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14507)|
| 4:01:56| even after January 1 and comes back to work at a later date, they will not go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14516)|
| 4:02:02| back into UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14522)|
| 4:02:04| They will be going into the STAR plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14524)|
| 4:02:09| And there is mandatory participation for all full-time officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14529)|
| 4:02:17| Employee contributions as an officer is 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14537)|
| 4:02:21| That is identical to what the county employees and the school's non-certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14541)|
| 4:02:27| employees are contributing now, and that's the same cost as what the UOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14547)|
| 4:02:32| employees are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14552)|
| 4:02:36| What is a little different about it is the match that the county will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14556)|
| 4:02:41| contributing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14561)|
| 4:02:43| As an officer, you can start contributions with your first payroll check of 6%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14563)|
| 4:02:49| and the county will match at a rate of 10% day one, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14569)|
| 4:03:00| In addition to that, there will be an additional 2% match on compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14580)|
| 4:03:05| that is called a supplemental contribution that has been put in place for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14585)|
| 4:03:12| period of at least five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14592)|
| 4:03:14| The pension board would re-examine this after calendar year 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14594)|
| 4:03:23| After 30 years of employment under STAR, the employer contribution would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14603)|
| 4:03:29| drop down to a 6% match from the initial 12% in total for the first 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14609)|
| 4:03:42| That is equivalent to what a county employee gets on their 6% contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14622)|
| 4:03:50| after they've been in place for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14630)|
| 4:03:53| But during their first 30 years of tenure, it would be a total of 12% match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14633)|
| 4:03:58| by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14638)|
| 4:04:07| STAR participants would direct how their money is invested just as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14647)|
| 4:04:11| participant in the current retirement system does for the 6% contribution that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14651)|
| 4:04:18| they make and for the 10% contribution that the county will put in on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14658)|
| 4:04:24| behalf into the mandatory account, the basic account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14664)|
| 4:04:29| The investment of the 2% supplemental will be handled, the investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14669)|
| 4:04:35| by the pension board based on the advice from investment consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14675)|
| 4:04:44| Vesting purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14684)|
| 4:04:47| An employee will be able to be 100% vested in the employer's 10% match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14687)|
| 4:04:55| after 10 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14695)|
| 4:04:58| Anything less than 10 years, they are not vested in any part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14698)|
| 4:05:03| employer contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14703)|
| 4:05:06| As far as the additional 2% for the supplemental contribution, they will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14706)|
| 4:05:11| vested after 15 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14711)|
| 4:05:17| If an officer terminates employment prior to being vested, all employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14717)|
| 4:05:24| contributions are forfeited by the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14724)|
| 4:05:30| The employee is always 100% vested in their contributions and can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14730)|
| 4:05:37| refunded their contributions upon termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14737)|
| 4:05:43| I will say a caveat has been put in regarding term limits for the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14743)|
| 4:05:49| and the chief deputy that they would be fully vested after a two-year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14749)|
| 4:05:55| two terms, eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14755)|
| 4:06:04| Normal retirement age under STAR is age 57 with a minimum of 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14764)|
| 4:06:15| At normal retirement age, they would also be vested in the 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14775)|
| 4:06:21| supplemental if they have the 10 years and are age 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14781)|
| 4:06:30| The definition of officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14790)|
| 4:06:33| Regularly employed, meaning full time, by the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14793)|
| 4:06:41| This includes the sheriff, the chief deputy, and other officers designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14801)|
| 4:06:47| as law enforcement or corrections by the Knox County Merit System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14807)|
| 4:06:55| There are three classifications of the Knox County Merit System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14815)|
| 4:06:59| One of them being law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14819)|
| 4:07:02| One of them being an officer as under correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14822)|
| 4:07:05| And the third is a civilian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14825)|
| 4:07:07| Civilians will not participate in STAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14827)|
| 4:07:12| Also, you will not have reserve officers or part-time positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14832)|
| 4:07:18| The officer under the sheriff will not be eligible for the retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14838)|
| 4:07:27| We have worked very diligently with looking at all these jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14847)|
| 4:07:31| and we are actually doing some minor cleanup of about three job titles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14851)|
| 4:07:35| but this will go into effect for January 1 using the Merit System's determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14855)|
| 4:07:43| If there is any issues, if there's any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14863)|
| 4:07:48| then that final decision will lay with the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14868)|
| 4:07:59| STAR is generally similar to the asset accumulation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14879)|
| 4:08:03| the retirement plan that the county and non-classified school employees have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14883)|
| 4:08:09| in that there is an employee and employer obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14889)|
| 4:08:14| and the employee has the responsibility of directing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14894)|
| 4:08:17| all or most of the investment choices related to their account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14897)|
| 4:08:26| It is administered by the pension board and subject to applicable IRS regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14906)|
| 4:08:31| and funded through a trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| The trust will be at Wells Fargo, which is where the asset accumulation plan trusts are also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14913)|
| 4:08:41| As far as amendment or terminations of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14921)|
| 4:08:46| the pension board reserves the right to amend or terminate STAR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14926)|
| 4:08:50| consistent with the provision of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14930)|
| 4:08:56| Was that very painful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14936)|
| 4:09:04| So far, so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14944)|
| 4:09:06| Okay, now this is my pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14946)|
| 4:09:08| This is where you come back and ask me questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14948)|
| 4:09:11| Luckily, I hope there's no tomatoes there to throw or anything, but I ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14951)|
| 4:09:19| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14959)|
| 4:09:25| You mentioned talking about the UOP possibly being rehired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14965)|
| 4:09:31| Whatever they had in that UOP under the old plan would stay as a separate retirement account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14971)|
| 4:09:35| They would start a new STAR, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14975)|
| 4:09:37| That is correct, and vesting would start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14977)|
| 4:09:40| And my second question would be, is the 6% the max that the employee can put in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14980)|
| 4:09:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14987)|
| 4:09:48| Add extra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14988)|
| 4:09:49| Any voluntary contributions will be done outside of our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14989)|
| 4:09:52| into voluntary plans that may be offered through payroll reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14992)|
| 4:09:56| or through their own bank or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14996)|
| 4:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=14999)|
| 4:10:02| This does not build a future obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15002)|
| 4:10:07| And this is pay-as-you-go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15007)|
| 4:10:09| Pay-as-you-go, just like the current county's plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15009)|
| 4:10:12| And then these dollars that will be accumulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15012)|
| 4:10:17| are not commingled in these other investment plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15017)|
| 4:10:22| This is a completely separate package of money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15022)|
| 4:10:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15025)|
| 4:10:26| It will be isolated in the individual's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15026)|
| 4:10:29| Right, isolated in the name of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15029)|
| 4:10:34| but the only people that will be in this particular plan or investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15034)|
| 4:10:39| will be law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15039)|
| 4:10:42| Law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15042)|
| 4:10:45| In other words, going a little bit further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15045)|
| 4:10:49| there is a big investment in the sky right now for other employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15049)|
| 4:10:55| These dollars will not be in that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15055)|
| 4:10:58| even though they're at different percentages or different matches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15058)|
| 4:11:02| or different vesting or whatever all the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15062)|
| 4:11:06| These dollars will not be in those account numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15066)|
| 4:11:09| They will be capsized by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15069)|
| 4:11:12| There can be situations where someone had been in an asset accumulation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15072)|
| 4:11:17| at a prior time and comes into STAR if they become an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15077)|
| 4:11:23| Those accounts will be separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15083)|
| 4:11:28| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15088)|
| 4:11:32| You're talking about if somebody leaves the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15092)|
| 4:11:36| before the end of the year and then comes back after the first of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15096)|
| 4:11:39| That doesn't include people who are on, like, maternity leave or family leave or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15099)|
| 4:11:43| No, they would have to terminate employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15103)|
| 4:11:45| That is not medical family, FMLA, at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15105)|
| 4:11:50| Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15110)|
| 4:11:51| Yeah, just to clarify, I just want to make sure, on my own mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15111)|
| 4:11:55| this is set up more like a 401k.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15115)|
| 4:11:58| It's a 401a for IRS regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15118)|
| 4:12:01| I just want to make sure that that's ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15121)|
| 4:12:03| Just like the retirement plan you and I are in as employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15123)|
| 4:12:07| It is a 401 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| The thing that I appreciate most about this is that you apply the KISS principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15129)|
| 4:12:14| Keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15134)|
| 4:12:19| Kim, could I editorialize a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15139)|
| 4:12:22| This is the toughest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15142)|
| 4:12:24| I haven't heard anyone choke on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15144)|
| 4:12:26| This is the biggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15146)|
| 4:12:29| I speculate that the bite the public has to chew off is that 10%, 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15149)|
| 4:12:34| that there's a 12% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15154)|
| 4:12:37| That's very liberal, very lucrative compared to private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15157)|
| 4:12:42| But we felt, I'm sort of speaking to the choir of those of you on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15162)|
| 4:12:47| but the docket committee felt that it needed to be a very liberal package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15167)|
| 4:12:51| to take the place of a defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15171)|
| 4:12:55| Even though it's 12%, several past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15175)|
| 4:12:58| the county taxpayers paid 15%, 16%, 17% of salary to fund the UOP actuarially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15178)|
| 4:13:07| But to me, that's the big number that we will hear resistance from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15187)|
| 4:13:11| from the working guy out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15191)|
| 4:13:14| Gosh, you're paying them 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15194)|
| 4:13:17| And I don't see any comments negatively from the commissioners here, which is good, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15197)|
| 4:13:24| Well, I was going to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15204)|
| 4:13:26| I'm glad you reminded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15206)|
| 4:13:28| My mind's going as age progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15208)|
| 4:13:32| Because the private sector has even cut back from the 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15212)|
| 4:13:36| Now some don't even do any, and a lot of them have cut back to 3% as a match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15216)|
| 4:13:43| Is this something that the 12% can be, I guess, changed as economy worsens or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15223)|
| 4:13:52| Five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15232)|
| 4:13:53| After five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15233)|
| 4:13:54| Well, that's the voluntary two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15234)|
| 4:13:56| The 10 is in the plan, and it would take a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15236)|
| 4:14:00| So it would take a charter amendment, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15240)|
| 4:14:03| Not a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| It would take a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15245)|
| 4:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15247)|
| 4:14:08| I'm just, what I'm thinking ahead is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15248)|
| 4:14:10| Because we didn't put 12% in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15250)|
| 4:14:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15253)|
| 4:14:14| Not that we would fall on financial times, but say the county got in financially strapped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15254)|
| 4:14:21| 10% could be a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15261)|
| 4:14:24| And that's why I want to know if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15264)|
| 4:14:26| So, basically, the pension board would have to revisit at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15266)|
| 4:14:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15270)|
| 4:14:31| But we have the right to amend this plan so long as we're not in violation of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15271)|
| 4:14:35| and the charter was not specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15277)|
| 4:14:38| And, Commissioner, I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15278)|
| 4:14:41| Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15281)|
| 4:14:42| What we, our thought there on the 10 and the 2 was that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15282)|
| 4:14:46| we want these employees to be retiring, you know, at 55 once their career in law enforcement is gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15286)|
| 4:14:52| and to where they had enough money into their 401A to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15292)|
| 4:14:57| And the actuary ran a bunch of numbers for us, and it seemed that the 10 and the 2 is what it was going to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15297)|
| 4:15:03| you know, after 25 years or 30 years of service to get to where that employee could afford to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15303)|
| 4:15:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15310)|
| 4:15:11| And I don't really have heartburn about the 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15311)|
| 4:15:16| I know the public is going to because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15316)|
| 4:15:20| a lot of the private sector has even gone away from matching any of their 401Ks that their employees are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15320)|
| 4:15:27| And that's the only thing that we're going to get pushback on that 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15327)|
| 4:15:32| We'll just ask them if they'll go out there and take a bullet for you for 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15332)|
| 4:15:35| I'm not saying I disagree with the 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15335)|
| 4:15:39| I'm just saying that that's the pushback we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15339)|
| 4:15:43| Bob Cross, 900 South Gay Street, Suite 1796.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15343)|
| 4:15:48| One of the things that we did as part of the development of UOP is look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15348)|
| 4:15:52| contribution levels for local emergency responders, police, fire, et cetera, throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15352)|
| 4:16:00| And if you look at the percentage of pay, for better or worse, being contributed by those organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15360)|
| 4:16:06| nationwide, it's actually considerably in excess of the 10% or even 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15366)|
| 4:16:12| There are a lot of figures, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15372)|
| 4:16:17| So this is the defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15377)|
| 4:16:21| Most of the plans throughout the country are defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15381)|
| 4:16:24| So the county does have to compete for those individuals in terms of retention and hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15384)|
| 4:16:30| So while 12% is high, at the same time, if you look nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15390)|
| 4:16:36| it's actually quite a bit lower than most systems in terms of emergency responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15396)|
| 4:16:44| Just to make that note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15404)|
| 4:16:48| We also got to look at their base salary for officers in a lot of these cases are a lot higher than ours also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15408)|
| 4:16:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15417)|
| 4:17:00| In the scheme of things, I think the actuary quoted to the board at one time that an analysis was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15420)|
| 4:17:08| If 18% of your salary was going in every payday every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15428)|
| 4:17:14| then in a reasonable rates of return for the 25, 30 years, you would expect to have enough to retire on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15434)|
| 4:17:23| And that's what's going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15443)|
| 4:17:25| That's 6% by the employee and 12% by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15445)|
| 4:17:31| And I will remind you, too, as Bob said, that this is one of the first non-defined benefit plans for officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15451)|
| 4:17:42| There's not very many out there across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15462)|
| 4:17:45| We're on the front end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15465)|
| 4:17:50| Has this been run by any of the officers' groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15470)|
| 4:17:57| Or are we the first ones hearing it, seeing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15477)|
| 4:18:01| There is a representative on the pension board that is part of the officers' group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15481)|
| 4:18:06| But I have not done a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15486)|
| 4:18:08| What has been their reaction to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15488)|
| 4:18:14| I remember existing officers aren't affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15494)|
| 4:18:22| Rick Trott, 5913 Wooded Acres Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15502)|
| 4:18:25| We did have representatives from the Fraternal Order of Police come to some of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15505)|
| 4:18:29| And the FOP seems to be good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15509)|
| 4:18:32| The men and women I've talked to under the UOP plan seem to be good with it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15512)|
| 4:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15518)|
| 4:18:42| Thanks, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15522)|
| 4:18:49| Okay. Phase 2, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15529)|
| 4:18:53| If you will notice on the screen and on the projection up on the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15533)|
| 4:18:57| that we're now talking about disability benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15537)|
| 4:19:03| The goal of the disability benefit is to provide a uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15543)|
| 4:19:08| and I don't mean uniform as in a badge and gun, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15548)|
| 4:19:12| a uniform, adequate, and affordable income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15552)|
| 4:19:17| security for county employees, officers, and non-certified school employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15557)|
| 4:19:25| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15565)|
| 4:19:28| This disability plan is replacing all the disability plans that are in place today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15568)|
| 4:19:36| There's a disability plan that covers officers under UOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15576)|
| 4:19:42| and it varies what type of benefit you have versus in line of duty versus not in line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15582)|
| 4:19:49| And there is a disability plan for the existing county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15589)|
| 4:19:55| and non-certified school employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15595)|
| 4:20:01| That said, it makes it very difficult to come up with calculations and administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15601)|
| 4:20:08| administering technically three different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15608)|
| 4:20:12| We have designed a disability plan, one universal plan for all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15612)|
| 4:20:18| that are covered by the retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15618)|
| 4:20:22| This will also take advantage of available tax breaks for employees drawing disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15622)|
| 4:20:28| if it's in line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15628)|
| 4:20:30| It will coordinate disabilities with workers' compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15630)|
| 4:20:34| social security disability, and it is very similar to what's in the private sector currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15634)|
| 4:20:44| It will incentivize people to return to work, whether it's with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15644)|
| 4:20:49| or whether it's in another career totally, and we'll have people assisting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15649)|
| 4:20:54| in getting retrained and reconditioned into some sort of job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15654)|
| 4:20:59| And it will reserve for future possibility of us having this insured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15659)|
| 4:21:05| should that decision be made down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15665)|
| 4:21:12| This disability plan will be effective January 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15672)|
| 4:21:19| As I mentioned earlier, we'll be closing the disability section of UOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15679)|
| 4:21:25| and anyone who becomes disabled on or after January 1, 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15685)|
| 4:21:31| they'll be under this new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15691)|
| 4:21:33| For those currently disabled, they will remain under the plan that they came under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15693)|
| 4:21:42| And the one universal plan will ease administration, record-keeping, and communications issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15702)|
| 4:21:55| Starting with eligibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15715)|
| 4:21:59| Currently eligible if you're an officer under UOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15719)|
| 4:22:04| or if you're under the old DB plan, which closed in 91 and still actively employed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15724)|
| 4:22:11| or if you're under the asset accumulation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15731)|
| 4:22:14| and you're a government employee or you're a non-certified school employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15734)|
| 4:22:19| The new plan will cover all those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15739)|
| 4:22:23| It will exclude those people who suffered a disability prior to January 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15743)|
| 4:22:29| because they'll remain in the old plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15749)|
| 4:22:33| In line of duty or on-the-job injury will have coverage day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15753)|
| 4:22:40| As far as eligible, if you're not in line of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15760)|
| 4:22:44| if I break my neck in a ski accident, that was not in line of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15764)|
| 4:22:50| and I will have to have been employed for five years to be eligible for coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15770)|
| 4:22:55| That is the same as what's in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15775)|
| 4:23:03| As far as a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15783)|
| 4:23:06| Under UOP, participants, meaning officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15786)|
| 4:23:09| permanently unable to perform the duties of a participant's job as an officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15789)|
| 4:23:14| they would be qualified for disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15794)|
| 4:23:18| Under the DB and asset plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15798)|
| 4:23:20| it's participants permanently incapable of engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15800)|
| 4:23:24| in any substantially gainful employment commensurable with his or her education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15804)|
| 4:23:30| experience, training, previous earnings, and utilization of vocational capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15810)|
| 4:23:37| And we're using those same definitions under the new disability plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15817)|
| 4:23:42| This does not exclude the state law about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15822)|
| 4:23:48| for officers who should have a heart attack or should have high blood pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15828)|
| 4:23:54| That is still commensurable as in line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15834)|
| 4:23:59| State law requires that and we're in compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15839)|
| 4:24:03| There will be an elimination period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15843)|
| 4:24:06| which is very common in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15846)|
| 4:24:10| Currently, you actually just use up all your leave time on compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15850)|
| 4:24:17| your sick leave and your annual leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15857)|
| 4:24:19| and then disability will start the first of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15859)|
| 4:24:23| following your last active paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15863)|
| 4:24:27| Now we're going to go to a 90-day waiting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15867)|
| 4:24:32| So the first three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15872)|
| 4:24:34| once you've been declared disabled, would not have compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15874)|
| 4:24:39| It could be longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15879)|
| 4:24:41| If your leave time that you have built up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15881)|
| 4:24:44| will get you out with full pay even longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15884)|
| 4:24:49| then it's till all your leave time has been depleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15889)|
| 4:24:55| In other words, that 90-day period is not a compensation period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15895)|
| 4:25:01| That 90-day period doesn't start till the end of your leave runs out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15901)|
| 4:25:06| No, it starts from your date of disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15906)|
| 4:25:09| 90 days from date of disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15909)|
| 4:25:11| And you may have 90 days of leave time to be paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15911)|
| 4:25:17| but you have 90 days before you'll start drawing a disability check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15917)|
| 4:25:22| But if you had 60 days built up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15922)|
| 4:25:25| Then you would have 30 days without pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15925)|
| 4:25:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15928)|
| 4:25:39| As far as the benefit formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15939)|
| 4:25:42| let's take this one step at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15942)|
| 4:25:46| Because if you thought the first half was simple, stay tuned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15946)|
| 4:25:52| There is a difference under the Uniformed Officers Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15952)|
| 4:25:57| If it's in line of duty versus not in line of duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15957)|
| 4:26:02| in the calculation of their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15962)|
| 4:26:06| So going across the board, there is no difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15966)|
| 4:26:09| in the DB-slash-Asset Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15969)|
| 4:26:12| as far as your entitlement to a disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15972)|
| 4:26:15| but there is in UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15975)|
| 4:26:17| For someone in line of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15977)|
| 4:26:19| 50% of the two-year highest average earnings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15979)|
| 4:26:23| is what they would be entitled to draw each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15983)|
| 4:26:27| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15987)|
| 4:26:30| For an employee not covered under UOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15990)|
| 4:26:34| they would get 50% of their five-year average earnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15994)|
| 4:26:38| highest average earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15998)|
| 4:26:40| And if they had dependent children, they would get 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16000)|
| 4:26:47| What we're going to in the new plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16007)|
| 4:26:50| is everyone will be entitled to 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16010)|
| 4:26:53| of their 12 highest month average earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16013)|
| 4:26:58| 60% of your earnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16018)|
| 4:27:01| irregardless of dependent children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16021)|
| 4:27:07| Not in line of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16027)|
| 4:27:09| the Uniformed Officers Plan was very lacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16029)|
| 4:27:12| if someone becomes disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16032)|
| 4:27:15| because their formula was 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16035)|
| 4:27:19| of their two-year highest average earnings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16039)|
| 4:27:22| times the number of years they've been in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16042)|
| 4:27:26| So for someone who may have only worked here six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16046)|
| 4:27:29| and became disabled for who knows what reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16049)|
| 4:27:33| you're disabled, you're disabled, and it's not very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16053)|
| 4:27:36| but they're only going to get 12% of their pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16056)|
| 4:27:43| In the new situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16063)|
| 4:27:45| 60% is 60% of their highest 12-month average earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16065)|
| 4:27:56| Following the elimination period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16076)|
| 4:27:59| the 60% predisability can and will be offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16079)|
| 4:28:03| if you're approved for Social Security disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16083)|
| 4:28:07| and or workers' compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16087)|
| 4:28:10| If they're being paid any of those benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16090)|
| 4:28:13| there's a dollar-for-dollar offset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16093)|
| 4:28:16| but there is a minimum benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16096)|
| 4:28:19| The minimum benefit that you can draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16099)|
| 4:28:22| from Knox County's Retirement Disabilities Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16102)|
| 4:28:25| is $150 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16105)|
| 4:28:29| And that would be after you've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16109)|
| 4:28:32| gotten approved for Social Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16112)|
| 4:28:35| and you're drawing what they'll be willing to pay you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16115)|
| 4:28:39| if that difference is even more than $150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16119)|
| 4:28:42| you're going to get $150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16122)|
| 4:28:45| even if they may have made more with Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16125)|
| 4:28:55| Cost-of-living adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16135)|
| 4:28:58| It's called COLA for short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16138)|
| 4:29:01| Cost-of-living adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16141)|
| 4:29:04| Currently, the Uniform Officer Plan has a 3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16144)|
| 4:29:07| cost-of-living adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16147)|
| 4:29:10| off their current monthly benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16150)|
| 4:29:13| That happens January 1 of each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16153)|
| 4:29:16| Under the DB SAS Asset Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16156)|
| 4:29:19| they have a 3% cost-of-living adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16159)|
| 4:29:22| off their original monthly amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16162)|
| 4:29:25| The new plan will have no cost-of-living adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16165)|
| 4:29:28| Again, this is very much like the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16168)|
| 4:29:31| In the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16171)|
| 4:29:34| when you're talking to insurance companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16174)|
| 4:29:37| they say, since Social Security gives you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16177)|
| 4:29:40| a cost-of-living adjustment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16180)|
| 4:29:43| that's getting you to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16183)|
| 4:29:46| where we don't go back and recalculate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16186)|
| 4:29:49| on any cost-of-living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16189)|
| 4:29:52| So the cost-of-living adjustment's coming from Social Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16192)|
| 4:29:55| and it's not coming from our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16195)|
| 4:29:58| So the amount of money you receive the first 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16198)|
| 4:30:01| if you're disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16201)|
| 4:30:07| Disability comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16207)|
| 4:30:10| The benefit duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16210)|
| 4:30:13| Under UOP, it's for your lifetime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16213)|
| 4:30:16| or until you're no longer disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16216)|
| 4:30:19| Under the DB Asset Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16219)|
| 4:30:22| it's normal retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16222)|
| 4:30:25| which is age 65 by definition right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16225)|
| 4:30:29| or withdrawal of your retirement account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16229)|
| 4:30:35| Under the new proposed disability plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16235)|
| 4:30:38| it will be Social Security normal retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16238)|
| 4:30:41| which for this purpose will be 67,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16241)|
| 4:30:44| or withdrawal of your retirement account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16244)|
| 4:30:50| The first of the calendar month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16250)|
| 4:30:53| following any of these events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16253)|
| 4:30:56| will stop and the first day of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16256)|
| 4:30:59| will be when benefits will begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16259)|
| 4:31:02| on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16262)|
| 4:31:14| Disability comparison dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16274)|
| 4:31:17| workers' comp and Social Security offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16277)|
| 4:31:20| Dollar-for-dollar offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16280)|
| 4:31:23| Offsets will not reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16283)|
| 4:31:26| the disability benefit below the minimum amount of 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16286)|
| 4:31:29| and participants are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16289)|
| 4:31:32| to pursue Social Security disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16292)|
| 4:31:35| once they're approved for disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16295)|
| 4:31:38| by the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16298)|
| 4:31:41| This is also something that is an assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16301)|
| 4:31:44| that we offer through our administrator, UNUM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16304)|
| 4:31:47| UNUM will assist them in filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16307)|
| 4:31:51| for Social Security disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16311)|
| 4:31:57| Adjustment with earnings while disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16317)|
| 4:32:00| I could talk through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16320)|
| 4:32:03| My bottom line is we will let them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16323)|
| 4:32:06| go back to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16326)|
| 4:32:09| in a retrainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16329)|
| 4:32:12| you know, new career or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16332)|
| 4:32:15| for up to a year with no offset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16335)|
| 4:32:18| to get into the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16338)|
| 4:32:21| and can I handle a new job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16341)|
| 4:32:24| And we encourage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16344)|
| 4:32:27| We don't do a dollar-for-dollar offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16347)|
| 4:32:30| all the way through for extra income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16350)|
| 4:32:33| Again, encouraging them to return to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16353)|
| 4:32:36| in anticipation of having the disability benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16356)|
| 4:32:39| to stop in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16359)|
| 4:32:42| We do not have that in place right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16362)|
| 4:32:45| We will be doing return-to-work programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16365)|
| 4:32:48| being proactive to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16368)|
| 4:32:51| This has been very big in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16371)|
| 4:32:54| and the earnings for employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16374)|
| 4:32:57| while disabled may be adjusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16377)|
| 4:33:00| for disability in a manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16380)|
| 4:33:03| intended to incentivize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16383)|
| 4:33:06| In other words, we're not going to penalize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16386)|
| 4:33:09| for making $100 a week for delivering papers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16389)|
| 4:33:13| if that's all they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16393)|
| 4:33:20| Earnings while disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16400)|
| 4:33:23| are adjusted for Consumer Price Index, CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16403)|
| 4:33:26| So the trial period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16406)|
| 4:33:29| they're not penalized if it's three or five years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16409)|
| 4:33:32| that they're going back to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16412)|
| 4:33:35| based on what they were making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16415)|
| 4:33:38| five years ago when they became disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16418)|
| 4:33:41| We take into account cost-of-living adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16421)|
| 4:33:44| with those calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16424)|
| 4:33:47| And the 12 months, they can return to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16427)|
| 4:33:50| without any deduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16430)|
| 4:34:00| The Pension Board will look at earnings annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16440)|
| 4:34:03| as we do currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16443)|
| 4:34:06| Disability participants must report their earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16446)|
| 4:34:09| They must report when their Social Security has been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16449)|
| 4:34:12| and how much they're being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16452)|
| 4:34:15| And we will continue to monitor their disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16455)|
| 4:34:18| with their doctor's reports on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16458)|
| 4:34:26| Generally, disability benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16466)|
| 4:34:29| are subject to federal income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16469)|
| 4:34:32| However, the IRS has a regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16472)|
| 4:34:35| that if Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16475)|
| 4:34:39| provides an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16479)|
| 4:34:42| then anyone who is disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16482)|
| 4:34:45| in the line of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16485)|
| 4:34:48| their benefits under disability would be tax-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16488)|
| 4:34:54| That ordinance will be on your agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16494)|
| 4:34:57| for August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16497)|
| 4:35:00| We have worked with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16500)|
| 4:35:03| We have worked with Jill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16503)|
| 4:35:06| in the director's office in writing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16506)|
| 4:35:09| And that will have to go through two readings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16509)|
| 4:35:12| on your agenda, August and September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16512)|
| 4:35:15| to pass this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16515)|
| 4:35:18| so that the employees who become disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16518)|
| 4:35:21| in line of duty can have their money tax-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16521)|
| 4:35:25| That will be effective for January 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16525)|
| 4:35:36| The Pension Board retains discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16536)|
| 4:35:39| uniformly applied to similar situation of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16539)|
| 4:35:42| to adjust disability benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16542)|
| 4:35:45| on the recommendation of independent claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16545)|
| 4:35:48| from the adjudicator, which is UNUM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16548)|
| 4:35:51| and the Work Incentive Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16551)|
| 4:35:54| So we'll be working very closely with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16554)|
| 4:35:57| to build these programs for return to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16557)|
| 4:36:00| to help get them filing Social Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16560)|
| 4:36:03| and to assist them in part-time jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16563)|
| 4:36:06| or whatever they may be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16566)|
| 4:36:09| to inevitably, hopefully, get them back into the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16569)|
| 4:36:18| We're almost done, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16578)|
| 4:36:21| Before we go any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16581)|
| 4:36:24| disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16584)|
| 4:36:27| Questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16587)|
| 4:36:31| We have two planned documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16591)|
| 4:36:34| that are doing second reading at the Pension Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16594)|
| 4:36:37| next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16597)|
| 4:36:40| The planned documents put what we've just summarized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16600)|
| 4:36:43| on the screens here into play for January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16603)|
| 4:36:50| Going back to the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16610)|
| 4:36:53| we're looking at other amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16613)|
| 4:36:56| In order to do this plan for January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16616)|
| 4:36:59| we will be required to do amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16619)|
| 4:37:02| to the existing plans, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16622)|
| 4:37:05| making mention that the new STAR plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16625)|
| 4:37:08| is in existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16628)|
| 4:37:11| as well as handling the removal of disability claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16631)|
| 4:37:14| in those other plans going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16634)|
| 4:37:17| effective January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16637)|
| 4:37:20| We will be closing the uniformed officer plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16640)|
| 4:37:23| to new enrollees January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16643)|
| 4:37:26| That doesn't mean that we're not going to have UOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16646)|
| 4:37:29| and any liability on that going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16649)|
| 4:37:32| because we have over 700 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16652)|
| 4:37:35| that are currently covered by UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16655)|
| 4:37:38| But things will start transitioning for new hires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16658)|
| 4:37:41| or rehires that come on board on or after January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16661)|
| 4:37:44| and they will be going into STAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16664)|
| 4:37:47| We'll be closing the disability claims section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16667)|
| 4:37:50| of the DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16670)|
| 4:37:54| We will be providing a 2% contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16674)|
| 4:37:57| to all disability participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16677)|
| 4:38:00| that are in a defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16680)|
| 4:38:03| each calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16683)|
| 4:38:06| Now, why would we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16686)|
| 4:38:09| You realize that you can only contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16689)|
| 4:38:12| to your retirement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16692)|
| 4:38:15| if you're actively employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16695)|
| 4:38:18| If you're on disability, you're not actively employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16698)|
| 4:38:21| So by making an annual contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16701)|
| 4:38:24| of 2% of their pre-disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16704)|
| 4:38:27| average earnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16707)|
| 4:38:30| they will be having some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16710)|
| 4:38:33| going into their retirement plan for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16713)|
| 4:38:36| This is a fixed amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16716)|
| 4:38:39| and they would have to be on disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16719)|
| 4:38:42| for 12 months prior to the first day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16722)|
| 4:38:45| of each calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16725)|
| 4:38:48| This will be done for ASAP plan participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16728)|
| 4:38:51| as well as STAR plan participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16731)|
| 4:38:54| starting in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16734)|
| 4:39:02| We will be updating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16742)|
| 4:39:05| the Uniform Officer and Closed DB plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16745)|
| 4:39:08| for mortality tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16748)|
| 4:39:11| and rates of return assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16751)|
| 4:39:14| and all that will go in for the calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16754)|
| 4:39:18| for January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16758)|
| 4:39:24| Actuarial impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16764)|
| 4:39:27| There is no adverse actual impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16767)|
| 4:39:30| on the retirement system in total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16770)|
| 4:39:33| for the changes we've just done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16773)|
| 4:39:36| In fact, there will be substantial savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16776)|
| 4:39:39| in the long run because STAR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16779)|
| 4:39:42| is not a defined benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16782)|
| 4:39:45| it's fixed at 12%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16785)|
| 4:39:48| and because the disability plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16788)|
| 4:39:51| is now designed very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16791)|
| 4:39:54| to the private sector's disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16794)|
| 4:39:57| with cost savings in the new disability plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16797)|
| 4:40:06| The next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16806)|
| 4:40:11| Next Monday, the Pension Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16811)|
| 4:40:14| will approve for second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16814)|
| 4:40:17| on the agenda the STAR disability plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16817)|
| 4:40:20| and conforming amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16820)|
| 4:40:23| to the current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16823)|
| 4:40:26| We will be recommending the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16826)|
| 4:40:29| for Commission approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16829)|
| 4:40:32| at the August Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16832)|
| 4:40:35| And Commission will also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16835)|
| 4:40:38| the ordinance for in-line and duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16838)|
| 4:40:42| allowed to have it tax-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16842)|
| 4:40:45| The ordinance will take two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16845)|
| 4:40:48| It will be on your August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16848)|
| 4:40:51| and your September agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16851)|
| 4:40:54| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16854)|
| 4:41:01| Commissioner Brault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16861)|
| 4:41:04| Thank you so much for all the hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16864)|
| 4:41:07| that you all have put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16867)|
| 4:41:10| I really appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16870)|
| 4:41:13| and I think our employees will, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16873)|
| 4:41:16| The only problem that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16876)|
| 4:41:19| with any of it is the 90-day wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16879)|
| 4:41:22| for disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16882)|
| 4:41:25| If we've got an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16885)|
| 4:41:28| who doesn't have any accumulated time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16888)|
| 4:41:31| they're without an income for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16891)|
| 4:41:34| If they own a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16894)|
| 4:41:37| it's a lot to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16897)|
| 4:41:40| but at least it's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16900)|
| 4:41:43| Again, that's what the private sector is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16903)|
| 4:41:46| I wish Commissioner Briggs was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16906)|
| 4:41:49| but Dr. Briggs also said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16909)|
| 4:41:52| it's not uncommon to see a 180-day waiting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16912)|
| 4:41:55| Again, they're thinking making sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16915)|
| 4:41:58| verification by the doctors, etc. like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16918)|
| 4:42:01| Sometimes someone thought to be disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16921)|
| 4:42:04| for testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16924)|
| 4:42:07| There's sometimes few and far between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16927)|
| 4:42:10| but it can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16930)|
| 4:42:13| The private sector is very common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16933)|
| 4:42:16| to have a waiting period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16936)|
| 4:42:19| before you start contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16939)|
| 4:42:22| to a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16942)|
| 4:42:25| That's not what the county does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16945)|
| 4:42:28| We allow you to start contributing day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16948)|
| 4:42:32| In the event we decide to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16952)|
| 4:42:35| and actually insure it in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16955)|
| 4:42:38| that option would be in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16958)|
| 4:42:41| based on our current plan design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16961)|
| 4:42:44| I don't like that about the private sector plan either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16964)|
| 4:42:47| I know how difficult it is on families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16967)|
| 4:42:50| when someone becomes disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16970)|
| 4:42:53| and suddenly their entire income evaporates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16973)|
| 4:42:56| They've got a house, utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16976)|
| 4:42:59| and they have absolutely no income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16979)|
| 4:43:02| If you have no savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16982)|
| 4:43:05| you can lose your house in that amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16985)|
| 4:43:08| I would much rather see us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16988)|
| 4:43:11| not allow people to contribute to their plan for 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16991)|
| 4:43:14| than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16994)|
| 4:43:17| That's the only objection that I have to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=16997)|
| 4:43:20| It's on moral grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17000)|
| 4:43:23| Do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17003)|
| 4:43:26| 90 calendar days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17006)|
| 4:43:29| That's 90 calendar days, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17009)|
| 4:43:32| They would get it the first of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17012)|
| 4:43:35| after completion of a 90 calendar day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17015)|
| 4:43:38| The doctor would say effective July 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17018)|
| 4:43:41| John Doe is disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17021)|
| 4:43:44| They would begin benefits the first of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17024)|
| 4:43:47| following the 90 day waiting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17027)|
| 4:43:50| Unless they have days saved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17030)|
| 4:43:54| so how long would it take to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17034)|
| 4:43:57| 20 days a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17037)|
| 4:44:00| That'd be 60 paid days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17040)|
| 4:44:03| Sick leave accrues, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17043)|
| 4:44:06| at least for the county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17046)|
| 4:44:09| a half a day a month of sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17049)|
| 4:44:12| Vacation depends on your tenure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17052)|
| 4:44:15| I hear Commissioner Broyles' concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17055)|
| 4:44:18| but I also hear that it would make employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17058)|
| 4:44:21| feel better when they're sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17061)|
| 4:44:24| as opposed to saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17064)|
| 4:44:27| I'm going to keep them all taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17067)|
| 4:44:30| No, they'd be incentivized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17070)|
| 4:44:33| to keep their sick days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17073)|
| 4:44:36| so that if they were disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17076)|
| 4:44:39| they would be at work in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17079)|
| 4:44:42| performing the work of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17082)|
| 4:44:45| which we've heard in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17085)|
| 4:44:48| to work when it's easy to take a sick day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17088)|
| 4:44:51| Right, but we also just passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17091)|
| 4:44:54| the ordinance encouraging people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17094)|
| 4:44:57| to take those sick days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17097)|
| 4:45:00| so that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17100)|
| 4:45:03| to save them for cash out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17103)|
| 4:45:06| at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17106)|
| 4:45:09| But if someone hasn't been working here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17109)|
| 4:45:12| 20 years, they may not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17112)|
| 4:45:16| adequate sick time or annual leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17116)|
| 4:45:19| saved up to last them those three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17119)|
| 4:45:22| So those are the people I'm most concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17122)|
| 4:45:25| I don't have a problem with it starting after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17125)|
| 4:45:28| all of their accumulated time has been used up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17128)|
| 4:45:31| But I do have a problem with just cutting them off cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17131)|
| 4:45:34| I will say also that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17134)|
| 4:45:37| employees have the opportunity to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17137)|
| 4:45:40| additional disability insurance through AFLAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17140)|
| 4:45:43| Many of them have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17143)|
| 4:45:46| Not necessarily 100%, but there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17146)|
| 4:45:49| other alternative plans that can be purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17149)|
| 4:45:52| by the employee to help subsidize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17152)|
| 4:45:55| in the event of a disability or short-term illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17155)|
| 4:45:58| And if you look at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17158)|
| 4:46:01| a lot of our employees are paid based on the salary survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17161)|
| 4:46:04| we don't pay them enough to afford those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17164)|
| 4:46:07| So that's really not a whole lot of help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17167)|
| 4:46:10| to the group that I'm thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17170)|
| 4:46:13| I just want to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17173)|
| 4:46:16| Commissioner Broll's about the hard work that y'all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17176)|
| 4:46:19| I appreciate it. I feel that y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17179)|
| 4:46:22| listened to what the voters had to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17182)|
| 4:46:25| in redrafting this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17185)|
| 4:46:28| I think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17188)|
| 4:46:31| The 12%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17191)|
| 4:46:34| I think that is a lot better than what we were paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17194)|
| 4:46:38| At least it makes them invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17198)|
| 4:46:41| in their own retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17201)|
| 4:46:44| It makes them accountable for some of their retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17204)|
| 4:46:47| not just strictly on the backs of the county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17207)|
| 4:46:50| Thanks for y'all's hard work, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17210)|
| 4:46:53| Commissioner, I want to remind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17213)|
| 4:46:56| that on the 10%, you were comparing to the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17216)|
| 4:46:59| sector. In this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17219)|
| 4:47:02| if they serve Knox County for nine years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17222)|
| 4:47:05| they leave with nothing, whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17225)|
| 4:47:08| that's a lot different than your traditional 401k.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17228)|
| 4:47:11| I don't have a problem with the 12%. I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17231)|
| 4:47:14| I'm saying that some of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17234)|
| 4:47:17| and I'm going to come back at yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17237)|
| 4:47:20| They're taking bullets. They're out there protecting you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17240)|
| 4:47:23| Their life is a little bit more riskier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17243)|
| 4:47:26| and their job is a little bit more riskier than the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17246)|
| 4:47:29| that I worked in, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17249)|
| 4:47:32| my company did go down to 3% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17252)|
| 4:47:35| Of course, our jobs aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17255)|
| 4:47:38| that dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17258)|
| 4:47:41| I'm a little upset about the military losing their hazardous pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17261)|
| 4:47:44| for war zones. That's another topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17264)|
| 4:47:47| I don't have a problem with the 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17267)|
| 4:47:50| I think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17270)|
| 4:47:53| I don't have a problem. It's a lot better than the 18%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17273)|
| 4:47:56| that we were paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17276)|
| 4:48:00| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17280)|
| 4:48:03| When Jeff just mentioned about the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17283)|
| 4:48:06| suppose that John Doe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17286)|
| 4:48:09| is hired on the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17289)|
| 4:48:12| and in four years he decides to go in the military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17292)|
| 4:48:15| or gets drafted and spends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17295)|
| 4:48:18| four years and comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17298)|
| 4:48:21| Is he stuck back where he left off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17301)|
| 4:48:24| He's on military leave. He's not terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17304)|
| 4:48:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17307)|
| 4:48:30| His time still accrues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17310)|
| 4:48:33| If he comes back to work, his time is accrued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17313)|
| 4:48:36| He can pay back to the account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17316)|
| 4:48:39| There's a legislation that's in place to allow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17319)|
| 4:48:42| to do catch-ups after they return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17322)|
| 4:48:45| For the period of time they were gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17325)|
| 4:48:48| they have that much time to catch up on their contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17328)|
| 4:48:51| On their part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17331)|
| 4:48:54| On their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17334)|
| 4:48:57| We would match what we're supposed to based on their contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17337)|
| 4:49:06| I know we said 12% several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17346)|
| 4:49:09| but it's 10% plus 2% for five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17349)|
| 4:49:12| to be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17352)|
| 4:49:15| The 2% is to be revisited in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17355)|
| 4:49:18| That's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17358)|
| 4:49:22| It may not be 12% forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17362)|
| 4:49:25| It's going to be based on what it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17365)|
| 4:49:28| retirement income might be for a 30-year employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17368)|
| 4:49:31| But it could go to 14%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17371)|
| 4:49:34| They could revisit that 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17374)|
| 4:49:37| and it could go to 4% or it could go down to 0%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17377)|
| 4:49:40| It can't go lower than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17380)|
| 4:49:43| The 2% could go down to 0%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17383)|
| 4:49:46| What the 2% is there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17386)|
| 4:49:50| If you remember, those assets are managed by the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17390)|
| 4:49:53| They're not managed as far as how they're invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17393)|
| 4:49:56| by the participant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17396)|
| 4:49:59| But the 2% is ideally a savings account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17399)|
| 4:50:02| to help pay for medical insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17402)|
| 4:50:05| to bridge them until they're Medicare eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17405)|
| 4:50:08| Because that's a devastating cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17408)|
| 4:50:11| to anyone who retires before they're eligible for Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17411)|
| 4:50:14| And one of the key reasons we said we would revisit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17414)|
| 4:50:18| not knowing what the medical status, medical insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17418)|
| 4:50:21| and Obamacare and et cetera like that's going to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17421)|
| 4:50:24| in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17424)|
| 4:50:27| We will revisit that again after five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17427)|
| 4:50:30| to see if there may be a totally different world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17430)|
| 4:50:33| It will be a totally different world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17433)|
| 4:50:36| in the medical insurance arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17436)|
| 4:50:39| And then one last thing that we've really maybe not spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17439)|
| 4:50:42| but I do think it needs to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17442)|
| 4:50:46| The forfeiting of the match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17446)|
| 4:50:49| during that first 10 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17449)|
| 4:50:52| I think I know where that may be headed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17452)|
| 4:50:55| and I believe I like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17455)|
| 4:50:58| in that there's been some concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17458)|
| 4:51:01| that someone may receive all this training and benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17461)|
| 4:51:04| and after the 3 or 4 years of intense training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17464)|
| 4:51:07| then up and leave us for a better job somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17467)|
| 4:51:10| Or after 6 or 7 or 8 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17470)|
| 4:51:13| go to Knox County and go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17473)|
| 4:51:16| I see that as a good incentive retention hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17476)|
| 4:51:19| and I want you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17479)|
| 4:51:22| that I thought I recognized that in there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17482)|
| 4:51:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17485)|
| 4:51:28| We're hoping that at age 55| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17488)|
| 4:51:31| the employee will have enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17491)|
| 4:51:34| in their 401K to where they can afford to retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17494)|
| 4:51:37| and have a good living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17497)|
| 4:51:41| to live on comfortably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17501)|
| 4:51:44| and we're hoping that the medical match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17504)|
| 4:51:47| the 2% that's hanging on the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17507)|
| 4:51:50| which you're not vested until after 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17510)|
| 4:51:53| so you lose that 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17513)|
| 4:51:56| we're hoping that that will bridge the insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17516)|
| 4:51:59| from 57 until Medicare kicks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17519)|
| 4:52:02| so that these employees in the Sheriff's Department can retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17522)|
| 4:52:05| That was a problem that we had before the UOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17525)|
| 4:52:09| By the way, Nick was chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17529)|
| 4:52:12| of the document committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17532)|
| 4:52:15| and he's done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17535)|
| 4:52:23| We appreciate the team being here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17543)|
| 4:52:26| Actually, you all should have been out of here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17546)|
| 4:52:29| by 3.45, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17549)|
| 4:52:34| We've got all the document committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17554)|
| 4:52:38| I see Steve back there and Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17558)|
| 4:52:41| Right. Dr. Briggs is the only one not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17561)|
| 4:52:44| from that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17564)|
| 4:52:47| It was weekly meetings. It seems like weekly meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17567)|
| 4:52:50| Maybe it's every two weeks from January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17570)|
| 4:52:53| through about two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17573)|
| 4:52:56| I know one thing when we sat down with the charter committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17576)|
| 4:52:59| I was on that subcommittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17579)|
| 4:53:02| about the UOP plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17582)|
| 4:53:06| and for them to be back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17586)|
| 4:53:09| in basically six months with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17589)|
| 4:53:14| if they had told us that in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17594)|
| 4:53:17| or whenever we were there, it seemed like a miracle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17597)|
| 4:53:20| but I appreciate the fact that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17600)|
| 4:53:23| were able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17603)|
| 4:53:26| and that it's simple enough to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17606)|
| 4:53:29| and I think it's a good basic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17609)|
| 4:53:32| for our uniformed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17612)|
| 4:53:35| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17615)|
| 4:53:38| Kim, does the body have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17618)|
| 4:53:41| I think we're about to wind down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17621)|
| 4:53:44| I do want to thank you and of course thank the document committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17624)|
| 4:53:47| for all the hours. The other thing that I would just add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17627)|
| 4:53:50| you look in this room and you see all the minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17630)|
| 4:53:53| that are being wrapped around this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17633)|
| 4:53:56| and there's some very significant experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17636)|
| 4:54:00| and talent and qualifications with Bill and Bob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17640)|
| 4:54:03| and Chris is always there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17643)|
| 4:54:06| of course Nick and guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17646)|
| 4:54:09| Richard Beeler, all these people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17649)|
| 4:54:12| significant experience in this field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17652)|
| 4:54:15| and I think that should be a level of comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17655)|
| 4:54:18| for the county and for our county taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17658)|
| 4:54:21| as we move into this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17661)|
| 4:54:24| so just thank you for that. Thank you for all you all's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17664)|
| 4:54:28| Okay, anything else? Anything else Kim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17668)|
| 4:54:31| I do have copies of the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17671)|
| 4:54:34| We'll have these right here and I'm glad to give you copies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17674)|
| 4:54:37| and I'll get extra copies up to Jolie's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17677)|
| 4:54:40| so they have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17680)|
| 4:54:43| Alright. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17683)|
| 4:54:46| Alright. Good night everybody. It's been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=17686)|
