| 0:27:30| the target gets larger, it's private school, home school, charter schools, parents, coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| youth pastors, scout leaders, anyone who intentionally puts himself or herself in the life of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| child for the purpose of making a positive difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| And I would like to invite you to our main event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| Every fall for the past 12 years, we've had an event at the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| We have over 1,500 area educators come to the Tennessee Theater for an evening of inspiration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| celebration, but more importantly, challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| That the date of the event is Tuesday, October 24th, and I'll follow up with an email so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| you'll have all this in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| I'd also like to ask that you consider sponsoring teachers from a school in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| Our desire is that no teacher have to pay to attend this event, but we want to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| a message of appreciation from our community that this community believes in what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| and we're willing to invest in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| So each seat at the theater is $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| We're an all-volunteer nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Every bit of the money goes to pay for the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| So nobody's making any dollars off of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| It's just a passion to make sure that teachers leverage the power of their influence to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| change kids' lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Who's your speaker this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Our speaker this year is a superintendent from Oklahoma by the name of Rob Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| And the reason we chose him is because he wrote a blog post called Hugging a Porcupine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| And the theme is, all children who come through our doors are ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| The dented cans are ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| The shiny ones are ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| They're all ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| And we have a responsibility to do right by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| Commissioner Nystrom, I was going to say, I want to thank Amy for sharing this with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| the commission and to my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| I guess I've been involved with it for about 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| And it's not just that it's kids, I've brought some of our foster parents to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| It's a very inspirational event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| You won't leave with a dry eye, and you'll leave inspired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| And there are big things in the future for REACH to teach them, not just here in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Tennessee, but hopefully around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| Miss Crawford is a remarkable teacher, and we're very lucky to have her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| So thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1798)|

| 0:30:00| I'd like to invite you to also visit my classroom at West Valley Middle School this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| I teach 7th grade English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| I forgot to give a shout out to my home turf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| It's a great use of discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1811)|

| 0:33:04| County as follows, the Knox County Commission hereby honors Richie Beeler for his many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=1984)|

| 0:33:31| it. Thank you, Madam Clerk. For me, this is as much of an honor to be able to stand here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2011)|
| 0:33:41| today in the company of little Richie and say he's a product of Gibbs High School. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2021)|
| 0:33:53| only that, his dad and I were in the same graduating class at Gibbs High School. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2033)|
| 0:34:01| that's what makes it a special honor for me to be able to stand here today and to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| to someone who could very well be my son that I'd really love to, I have one son that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| good, but Richie is as good a son as anyone could have ever hoped to have. Now then, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2053)|
| 0:34:22| most important thing about what was read in the resolution is, he's standing here saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| is all that stuff true? It's more than true. When I was at the other end of Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| and came to the Register of Deeds office, because I had interest in old pieces of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| the Register of Deeds office, all the folks in there were happy to help me whenever I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| showed up, and I was just a telephone guy from the other end of Gay Street. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| I want to congratulate you on your retirement, but then most important, let me present the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| Register of Deeds, Ms. Sherri Whitt. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner, and thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| for your recognition of someone that we are so proud to have worked with. It has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| my honor and privilege to work with Richie Beeler almost my entire career at Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| Government. I can assure you that the citizens of Knox County are better off because of someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| like Richie Beeler in the Register of Deeds office. There is nothing about, not just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| Register of Deeds office, but I'm going to say county government in general that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| this gentleman doesn't know. So about six months ago, he came to me, and it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| a surprise because all of us knew that one day that Richie would be called for the ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| So several of you have said, well, Sherri, are you not going to try to talk him out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| this? And I said, wait a minute, when somebody else tried to talk him into it or did talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| going there. We love Richie and we miss him dearly every day, but we are so proud for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| him and we appreciate this recognition. Richie? Thank you. I don't know what to say to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2162)|
| 0:36:25| that, but I've been honored for 31 years to get to work with the people I've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| with, especially Sherri Witt, who's been a phenomenal boss and a great office holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| and Steve Hall, who I could say the very same thing about, to be able to work alongside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| Nick McBride, who's been a stand-up guy and made my job a whole lot easier than it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| have been, and just a lot of great people in this building. It's hard to say that 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| years in a place prepared you for something else, but the Lord counted me faithful, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| Paul would say, I suppose, and put me into the ministry, and I'm very grateful to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| place and to all of you for helping to be part of that preparation. So thank you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| much. As we continue with today's business, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2228)|
| 0:37:20| not want to stand in the way of getting someone to work. If there be no objection, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| like to at this time call on Resolution 17-7-110, if there be no objection. Could I hear a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2248)|
| 0:37:47| to remove it from consent for consideration? So moved. Second. Motion is properly before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| us to hear Resolution 17-7-110 at this time. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2273)|
| 0:38:01| motion carries. Madam Clerk, could you please read? Consideration of a resolution of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, accepting the resignation of Harold Stewart as Judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| Magistrate for Knox County, C.E., due to his retirement and appointing Dustin Dunham to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2292)|

| 0:38:24| expire July 31, 2021. This is Resolution 1-10. Seeing no further discussion, the motion before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2304)|
| 0:38:35| us is to approve. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The motion carries. The Honorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| Judge Cerny and the candidate for office, could you please approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2323)|
| 0:39:13| If I could, thank you so much for recognizing us and thank you so much for taking us a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| bit out of order. I appreciate you. I probably need to go look at some search warrants myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| and Dustin wants to go approve some warrants so that folks can go to jail where they belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| Golly. But I want to take a moment to also thank and appreciate Harold Stewart. Harold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| Stewart has been a magistrate for Knox County and has helped us in our criminal justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| process for so many years, probably in excess of 30 years or so? No. Not quite? Would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2384)|
| 0:39:52| 23 years, I'll disperse. Thank you, Harold, for your dedicated service. I appreciate you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2392)|
| 0:40:10| Vice Dustin Dunham has been very faithful as a substitute Judicial Magistrate, helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| out when folks are sick and under the weather and can't be present to fulfill their daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| responsibilities, but he has done that so faithfully that he's amassed a number of hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| as a substitute and so as a result, we've got a very experienced person who does an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| excellent job at Judicial Magistrate who I've never had the first complaint about or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=2433)|

| 0:50:51| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| If I be allowed one more discretion this evening, there is only one item that's not on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3053)|
| 0:51:02| at this particular point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| The item that is not on consent, I would ask if there be objection to calling for its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| reading at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| That is 8.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| The resolution 8.01, you should also mark the vote cast tally of the work session meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3083)|
| 0:51:32| should be 10, 0, 0, and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| That's the only marked piece of information that I have before us so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| Madam Clerk, if you could read resolution 8.01, and we will take that for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3104)|
| 0:51:53| This is on page 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee approving a memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3116)|

| 0:52:04| property located at 1725 Delaware Avenue to the City of Knoxville for the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| of the property into a multi-purpose recreation, art, and education facility for the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| and youth of Lonsdale and the greater Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Resolution 8.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Since I bring it off the agenda for consideration at this point in time, I move for its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| You have somebody in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| We have people in public forum that want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you, Madam, for reminding me that of public forum to speak to the issue, I do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3159)|
| 0:52:49| have the names who wish to speak to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3175)|
| 0:53:10| Please talk amongst yourselves, get in order, and give me a name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3190)|
| 0:53:18| please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| My name is Patricia Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| I live at 4034 Ivy Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| I grew up in the Mechanicsville community and Lonsdale is just as much my home as East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| Knoxville is where I live now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| However, in watching this situation progress, there has yet to be presented any plans, agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3217)|
| 0:53:48| concerns, or anything to be presented to the community on how this will be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| So far, all we know is a facility intended for youth and Lonsdale children as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3235)|
| 0:54:03| Emerald youth children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| However, we don't know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| We don't know how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| We don't know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| We don't know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| And it seems, it doesn't quite seem reasonable to me that this would be approved at a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3255)|
| 0:54:24| where we don't know where it's going and what it's going to be, and how it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| to be done or ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Does anyone have questions of the presenter, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| Well, I think it's important for us, ma'am, our part of this is conveying land to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| city to facilitate this deal, this program, and so if it doesn't work out, then the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3286)|
| 0:54:54| will be re-given or we'll get the land back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| We're just a small partner in this, and so I think that's kind of our role for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| But I think there's been several community meetings about the programming and about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| the division of the aspect, and so I just want, as a county, all we're doing is conveying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| land to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| And if it doesn't continue, we get our land back and we're back to square zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| So that's kind of where we're at as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| I understand that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Mr. Commissioner, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| However, I can't really say there's been community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| There's been community presentations, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| They came out and told them what they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| There's not been a real consensus taken of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| There's not been a presentation of structure and how the community will be served by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Emeril is a private foundation, charter school, and for their facility to be connected right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3356)|
| 0:56:04| next to Sam Hill County School, I just don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| It makes me somewhat feel that Sam Hill may not be there in the end, and that they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| eventually take over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| And I believe at this time, there's only two elementary schools in that whole side of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| in the west side of that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| So it makes me feel that Sam Hill could be threatened eventually, and in addition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| give up the land so closely to the school, of course, it inhibits any future expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3396)|
| 0:56:45| or possibility of renovations or whatever to the school in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| So at this point, I just feel that enough information has not been presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| as the councilors, commissioners, I'm sorry, or to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3422)|

| 0:57:12| Melvin Kyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| I live at 1504 Delaware Avenue in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| I'm here tonight to just say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| I want to thank Mr. Clemmons and some more guys, and I'm the younger one of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| One thing, Lonsdale, we need something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| Everybody keeps saying they used to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Listen, I bought property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| So I'm telling you now, our kids have nothing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| Every time it's on the news, there's something bad about Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| I wouldn't have purchased a house if everything's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| You have bad in y'all neighborhood, some of y'all might not care about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| But I'm fighting for these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| That's who I'm fighting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Nobody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| They talking about we didn't have meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| We got to have money to have meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| Nobody wants to buy nothing out there, do nothing for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| That's why they be in the newspaper and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| We got to get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| I'm a homeowner out there and still reside there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| They gave me enough information that we need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| If you want information, you come out there to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| We did a little picnic this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| We tried to get the kids to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| It was just too hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Now they didn't want nothing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| If you go out there and look at Lonsdale, there's nothing but trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| You remember Concord when we had a bad storm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| That's what kind of storm we in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| We need work not delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| We need work done now for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| And I'm going to be fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| When people come up here, you make sure they say their address, if they live in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| They can't talk for Lonsdale if you don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| You used to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| But I am a resident there and I will keep fighting for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| And I just hope the council will please vote in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| I'm begging you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you, Mr. Kyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Questions of this presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| If not, moving on, sir, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3562)|
| 0:59:31| My name is Pastor Joseph B. Smith, pastor of New Friendship Baptist Church on Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| Avenue for 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| I reside at 5904 Wind Trace Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| I've been a pastor for 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| I live right across the street from the facility that we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| I see what's going on in Lonsdale and we need this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| We do have stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Stakeholders we have had come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| Some of them are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| What bothers me when people outside who don't have any skin in the game are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| to tell us what we need and don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| I see the element of embracing our youth to make them whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| It's not just a sports complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| It's a place for them to get their education, tutoring, to make them whole, to be an asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| So I implore you as a pastor and seeing a lot of things are going on in Lonsdale, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| kids are, how you say, are not down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| They're asking for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| And I'd be appalled if you pass over them and don't reach out a helping hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| When somebody going to invest in Lonsdale, it must don't sit well with some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| But I'm asking for this lifeline, for your support as well as your prayers, as somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| going to come and invest in it to help us to, how you say, to make our community better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3658)|
| 1:01:06| Not only I represent the Friendship Church, but I represent the Lonsdale Union of Churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3666)|
| 1:01:14| which consists of seven churches who also is in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| Not only the seven, these churches are in the Lonsdale community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| Not only are the churches supported, I have a letter that's submitted from the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| area pastors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| We see this as a vital part to make Knoxville better, not just Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| So I'm encouraging you, asking you for your support, and just this part of land has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| desolate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| There have been houses, been a criminal element in it, and somebody willing to put something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| in it to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| And we cannot, as stakeholders, say, do not pass us by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| I need you to solicit your vote and your support to make Knoxville better by way of Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3720)|
| 1:02:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| Thank you, Pastor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| My fellow commissioners, are there any questions of this presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3730)|
| 1:02:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Did you have some supporters with you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Would they stand up so we can see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| They don't live somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| They're a part of Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| So keep that in mind, because the complaints are coming from folks outside of Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| Thank you, Pastor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Is there someone else standing to speak to the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Lenny Clements, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| I live at 3304 Gap Road, Lonsdale, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| I just want to say I appreciate your time today coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| I was born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| I've been here serving the last 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| I can remember growing up with Mr. Campbell here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| When we grew up, we had centers and basketball courts and playgrounds to play on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| Those are gone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Nothing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| I've been coaching football since 2003 in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| Kids have nothing to do out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| I see this every day, that they have no courts to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| They have no fields to play in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| And I think this would be something they really need, an investment like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| Don't come around in a lifetime in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| You're talking about a big investment that can enhance the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| Also, I look at the bigger picture, which is going to be education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| You're going to have community centers to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| You can get tutoring there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Also, diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| We gear our kids just to play the same old sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| Soccer and lacrosse would be a great sport to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| Something different than traditional football, basketball, baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| Also, a lot of people don't know about history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Jim Brown, he led it in lacrosse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| So let's teach our kids to reach higher than just the same old, same old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Because you've got to broaden the horizon and show them there's something to work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| This center would give them something to where they would be able to look to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| and take ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Like, this is my playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| This is my park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| This is my soccer field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| This is my center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Ownership will make you do better in life and create better character and a better person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| So I implore you, this is something we really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| And just, everybody worry about if it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| If it don't work, we'll go back and fight for it and make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| But we can't just kill this program just because a few people from the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| who don't see the benefit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| I guess I'm going to use the right words here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| I have an event for one weekend to kill the whole 365 days a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| because I support kids my entire career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| So I've been hearing people who know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| I'm involved in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| I love kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| I do everything I can for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| And honestly, people, kids are our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| When we get old, they're going to be running our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| running the council, running our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| So we've got to make them better citizens and give them a chance in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| And if we don't do this, they might not have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| It's about diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| It's about everybody getting involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Not just one particular brand of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| It's about people in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Because if you look around Knoxville, we're killing each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| We need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3914)|

| 1:05:18| Questions, my fellow commissioners of this presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| Are there other persons who wish to speak to the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| Is there further discussion among my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| We'll pause for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3932)|
| 1:05:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| DeJuan Hodge, 1961 Paschal Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| I look at all these kids in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| and not that long ago, I was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| We really do need this community center, this rec center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| We need it in the worst way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| And the reason being is because as these kids don't have anything to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| they're more and more out on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Now, I'm going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I'm 38 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| When I was 15, 16, and 17, I lost I don't know how many friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| How many of y'all have lost friends without them being in the war?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| Or being in a war?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| I mean, can you imagine at the age of 15, 16, 17 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| you're losing friends at least one a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| 12 months in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Sometimes you lose two a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| These kids, I really want them to have a chance to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| I want them to have a chance to partake in these activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| I want them to have a chance at this community center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| because I believe it will elevate them to a higher place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| We all come from the same world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| We all come from the same country, some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| There's no difference between you guys, these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| You guys were kids once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Remember what it was like just to be a kid and to be carefree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| Not to have to worry about when you go outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| when you hear a gunshot, you have to duck down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| Just to be a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| And I'm all thumbs up on the up and up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| And please don't turn us away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you, Mr. Hodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Questions of this presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| One quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Many of you fellow commissioners know I've got a background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| I spent the last decade working in a social work field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| And while we're calling this a rec center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| I want to let you know I'm intimately familiar with the work of Emerald Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| And the difference between a rec center and some of the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| that Emerald Youth has got a history of generating good outcomes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| is that if it was just a simple rec center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| we'd just be talking about a court or a field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| When the Emerald Youth group is involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| we're talking about changing outcomes for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| They've got a proven history of changing outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| They're a United Way agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| And I guess I just want to let you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| I just refereed one of their swim meets just about a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| and I couldn't personally think more highly of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| having seen their work firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| So thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| We have a number of kids in the audience that are with Emerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| and I'd just like to hear from one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| or if they are just in favor, just to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| Because that will actually serve the kids, that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4147)|
| 1:09:25| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| Now, Madam Clerk, I believe we're top...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4177)|
| 1:09:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I appreciate everyone being here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| to speak on behalf of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| especially since we're an hour into a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| It wears on you a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| Madam Clerk, are we now on page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| top of the page, amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| I've butchered the agenda so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| that we may have to call the Dr. Briggs back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| to get it stitched back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4210)|
| 1:10:27| The first thing that I had marked was resolutions...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| I want to draw your attention to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Resolution 17-7-501 through 518.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4237)|
| 1:10:45| Those are all from the community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| That's pages 12 through 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| They've been deferred to the August meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| pending federal authorization of the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| that it would take to perform these activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| Next, I'd also like to draw your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| to the fact there are line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Two pages have been added either Tuesday or Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| or two different sets of line item transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| associated with roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| I believe both of them were out of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| Just drawing your attention to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| because it is as printed in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| We have already dealt with resolution 801,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| and as I stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| the vote that evening at the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| was 10-0-0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| Are there other additions, deferrals, or withdrawals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| that are not duly noted in the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| that is in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| Are there adds, deferrals, or withdrawals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| that are not published in the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| that is before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Are there any discussion items to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| The agenda is properly before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| as it is presented then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Do I hear a motion to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| The motion before us is that the agenda be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4348)|

| 1:12:38| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| Madam Clerk, does that bring us to drives and roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| They're all mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=4363)|

| 1:38:51| Business offices are medical facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| and they also put residential in that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| to help, you know, be close to their medical needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| Like in Birmingham, they have some things down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| that you buy apartments right over a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| medical facility to where they just go down the escalator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| and they have grocery stores and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| That's sort of like an assisted living to get more use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| out of that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| But if you take that zoning away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| it seems like you'd have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| for more use on review type zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| and questions that would come up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| But it was originally done to where you could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| more mixed use down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| And it doesn't have to be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| It could be out in some residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| that you don't want the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| But anyway, just taking something away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| to just look like it cleans up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| it seems like it takes some of the property owner's rights away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| And we did that to give more use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| wider use of those lands in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| So I'm not sure if we're closing up a hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| or we're restricting people's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| So I'm not sure on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6003)|

| 1:40:09| Commissioner Schoomaker, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Because of the wording general residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| that's not specific about anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| not like a medical residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| It says a general residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| which can be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| I mean, there's no reason why you wouldn't move that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| to the general residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| It's word for word the same as what it should be moved to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| You can't imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| I think it's a typo from years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| Somebody put it in there and it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| I don't even think people are aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| I guess one point of clarification on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Commissioner Schoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| Living in the fourth district in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| we've gone through a big plan of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| and yes, I know this is the city and not the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| but there's been a big push for mixed use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| and sort of residential and commercial districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| just to kind of promote folks coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| And this one just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| it seems like is there a possibility down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| in an area that might have some of those commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| with the medical office area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| would that prevent mixed use in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| And I guess to kind of make it real,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| can you give me, for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| is there any areas in town that we might be familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| where this actually might apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| Have you seen any just so we can kind of paint a picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| Well, of course, again, with our zoning classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| we can do a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| In other words, we're not locked into all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| We can at any time instruct the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| to do similar to what the city of Knoxville is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| as they are doing now with a cell tower ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| But if you're looking at a mixed use type development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| we do have in your district the North Shore Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| which is actually a town center classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| where you have commercial, you have apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| and you have single family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| and multifamily residential, plus a school as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| So, again, I don't think we're taking anybody's rights away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| I think what we're doing is just simply moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| you know, if it says residential, it should be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| If it says office, it should be office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| Well, that's kind of the discussion that I'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| The mixed use kind of looks like this is where this is geared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| before the word mixed use became, you know, common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| And so if we eliminate this as a county, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| and I'd have to recheck it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| North Shore Town Center is obviously all in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| and so that's under a city ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| not a county zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| and I don't think the county has a mixed use zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| And so if we take this out, we take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| And until we maybe relook at our zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| taking this out, if somebody wanted to develop a mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| they can't unless they use this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| So if you eliminate residential from this OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| you can't do a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| If somebody wanted to do a small town square somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| you couldn't do it because you wouldn't allow residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| you couldn't allow residential in your commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| So unless there's a redo of or a bringing in of a mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| I'm not for it because it eliminates the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| of a unique development somewhere else in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| I guess I'll ask Dan this question, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| Dan doesn't come to work until 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| He's going to clock in a little early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| He headed this way, so he made himself open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| Oh, we've got two Dans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| Dan or Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Dan, does the county have a zoning that would fit a multi-level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| assisted living facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| These are things that are going to be coming into play more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| We're seeing a lot more of them pop up in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| and as our society ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Do we have another way to work that deal without this OB zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| To be honest with you, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| I know the OB zone does accommodate assisted living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| and it allows multi-story structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| I don't know exactly how high, but it does allow multi-story structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| Probably even some of the commercial zones would accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| an assisted living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| They would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| The new thing on the block, though, is the senior independent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| and the building official has been grappling with that issue here lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| as to where that would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| John, maybe we need to look at a lot of these things hand-in-hand then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| Seeing no further discussion, moving on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| Did Dan want to say something, too, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Daniel, I mean, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Discussion regarding the National Association of Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| I brought the reading of the county news, the National Association of Counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6324)|
| 1:45:31| as a reason for raising the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| I did not do the math before the last meeting, but looking at $500 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6336)|
| 1:45:48| Reading the county news letter about our voting rights at the National Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6348)|
| 1:45:56| for which it's been a long time since anyone really tried to advance in the chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| of the National Association of Counties because our term limits are not conducive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| to someone maybe being a county commissioner for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| and then attempting to be in the chairs at the national level Association of Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6372)|
| 1:46:19| In my simple math, and I could be wrong, but at $500 a vote, and we had 18 votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6379)|
| 1:46:26| we're sending them $9,000 plus a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| Madam Director of the Commission Office, did you wish to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| I did not know if you had any other research or data to be added to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6401)|
| 1:46:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| If I could ask Dwight Vandervate to come down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| He just recently returned from Columbus, Ohio for the National NACO Conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| so he might be able to give us a little insight if our dues are well worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| I took my coat off because I thought I was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| A good conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| A lot of time on the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| For obvious reasons, I didn't actually attend a whole lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| I went to three Transportation Subcommittee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| and a number of Transportation and Smart City meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| all of which were really, really interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| especially a lot of focus on autonomous vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| I don't want to sound futuristic, but from all indications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| they're coming and they're coming faster than we would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| But time well spent and a good conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| I don't know if there's anything specific that you'd want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| but again, a lot of discussion about the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| In fact, one of the speakers was the author of a book called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| Orange is the New Black, about experience in prison that she had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| that was related to drug use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| So that was a heavy emphasis at the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| Historically, I think we eliminated NACO in 2011, maybe, or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6497)|
| 1:48:24| and found that there are benefits other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| I mean, the National Conference is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| It's got a lot of great topics in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| But there's other things that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| I mean, I've been a part of their pre-trial diversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| and their mental health through corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| and there are a lot of studies and a lot of things that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| that assist us in making decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| Now, a return on investment is hard to find with something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| but there's a lot of great information and a lot of great knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| and there's a lot of great seeing how best practices work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| And so I think it's, although it's $9,000 and it seems like a lot maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| but I think there's value in that membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| I attended a NACO conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| We made a presentation there as Knox County for our walkability study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| and I did attend some of the conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| like Commissioner Andrews was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| our situation of mental health in our Knox County jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| which actually in that meeting there must have been 250 counties represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| and they were far worse off than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| So it was good to hear from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| to help we don't get to the situation they are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| So, again, I do think that we should have a couple of people there every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| to go to the conference to bring back some of the studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| and the meetings they have that would be worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| Mr. Chairman, the national conference is in Nashville next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| so while lodging is expensive in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| travel would not be a particularly tough cost for commission next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| Thank you, Mr. Van de Veet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| While you're standing there, please remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| Commissioner Schoonmaker and I attended your presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| on Canton Hollow Road, public hearing on the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| Could I get about five sentences from you about the impact of that public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| We generally think for a project of that magnitude that it was pretty well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| Obviously there were a couple of folks that had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| and I break them down into two categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| folks that had some form of ideological opinion about the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6633)|
| 1:50:40| and the necessity for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| and in particular the necessity for pedestrian facilities associated with the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| and we heard those arguments and had some lively discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| And then there were some folks who are adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| who are affected by the realignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| and we paid obviously close attention to their interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| to try to figure out if there's accommodations that we could make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| that would make the project less impactful on those particular property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| So for a $4 million project and 1.8 miles length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| I actually thought that it was pretty successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker was there, you were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| I'm not sure I may have missed one or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| but I appreciate the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| I thank you for the presentation made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| I know it's the number one road priority in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| and I appreciate your staff working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| I also want to thank Cindy Pionkey for looking up the titles research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| on a track of land on Canton Hollow Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| and it is nice to see that the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| does actually own part of Knox County, so that was kind of neat to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| And then moving into announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6714)|
| 1:52:12| Jolie Retirement Reception Assessment is $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| Please see the Director of the Commission Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| There are three or four things that I need to make note of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6743)|

| 1:54:09| Metropolitan Planning Commissioner Director Gerald Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| this is prior to our next work session at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| will speak about the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| Prior to the work session, August the 21st, 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| A couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| July the 27th, I backed up here, the Mayor Burchett will be at New Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6873)|
| 1:54:45| It's the second annual corn and tomato festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| the second annual corn and tomato festival at New Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| Mayor Burchett will be ringing the bell to kick the thing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| At 3 o'clock, the festival runs from 3 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| But then the last thing that I have on my list of items, Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| it will take you 25 years to catch up with Granger County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6913)|
| 1:55:22| Former Commissioner Ed Schaus thought I lived in Hamlin County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| and I actually do not associate more with the Granger County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| No, I associate with Union County just as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| But the Granger County Tomato Festival is this upcoming weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| So the 27th, you can go to our farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| The 28th, 29th, and 30th, you can go to Granger County's festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| and throw tomatoes at your best friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| So much for the announcements of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| Does anyone else have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| If there be no other announcements, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6956)|
| 1:56:12| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6972)|
| 1:56:16| I call to order this, the July meeting for zoning request in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6976)|
| 1:56:24| Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=6984)|

| 1:56:45| All members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| Welcome, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| Madam Clerk, would you please read the first item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| 6-A-17-SP is request of Ball Homes LLC for Southwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7017)|
| 1:57:06| for RR Rural Residential to LDR Low Density Residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| located south side of Choteau Road, southeast of South North Shore Drive in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7040)|
| 1:57:27| Here on behalf of the applicant, I am also with Ryan Hickey with Ball Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| and Buddy Goodwin, who is their General Counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| Thank you, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| Commissioners, the MPC recommends that you adopt the amendment to the Southwest Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| from Rural Residential to Low Density Residential as requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7072)|
| 1:58:01| By a vote of 11 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7081)|
| 1:58:07| Seeing no further discussion, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion that we approve the request of Ball Homes for the Sector Plan Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7090)|
| 1:58:17| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| Seeing no further discussion, a motion properly before us. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| Say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| Motion carries. Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| Request of Ball Homes LLC for rezoning from A Agricultural to PR Plan Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| at a density of up to 4.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| Property located south side of Chosen Road, southeast of South North Shore Drive in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| This is 6-A-17-RC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| I recognize Counselor Seymour is still being present. Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7135)|
| 1:59:02| Mr. Seymour, the Planning Commission recommends that you approve rezoning of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| to plan residential at a maximum density of 3 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| The applicant did request 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| This recommendation is made as basically a two-part recommendation or based on two points primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| One, it is very consistent with the existing development that is surrounding the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| And two, the growth plan in this particular case, this particular piece of property is located within the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7167)|
| 1:59:35| However, it is contiguous to the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| Three units per acre is the maximum density that we can recommend at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| Thank you, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| Counselor, do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| If I may, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| Our request was originally 4.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| Actually, it was 3 units and we amended it to 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| We would like to request 3.3 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7201)|
| 2:00:07| That would allow this tract of property, which is a little over 27 acres, to have 8 additional homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7207)|
| 2:00:15| We would have to go back and amend our concept plan with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7215)|
| 2:00:21| As Mr. Kelly has stated, the MPC recommendation is based upon the constraints of the urban growth plan adopted by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7221)|
| 2:00:34| the town of Farragut and the city of Knoxville, adopted January 12, 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| If you go to that plan on page 8, it has other recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7240)|
| 2:00:48| It says, one, a standing growth policy coordinating committee should be in place at all times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| so that if the plan is to be amended, time will not be lost making appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7254)|
| 2:01:01| Two, the growth policy plan should be periodically reviewed and, if warranted by change conditions, amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7261)|
| 2:01:08| This review should occur every three years, beginning with the third anniversary of the effective date of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| which would have been January 12, 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| We're here in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| The committee, as far as I know, is not still meeting and hasn't met since this plan was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7282)|
| 2:01:31| There have been no further reviews of this plan since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| so it should have been reviewed probably five or six times since it was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7297)|
| 2:01:44| To date, that has not occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| And some of the committee members have moved off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| One who was a partner in our law firm lives in Greenville now and probably would not be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| I think there have been other people who have moved off or who perhaps have passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| But by not following the urban growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7324)|
| 2:02:09| I think it's really been abandoned by Knox County, the city of Knoxville, and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| Furthermore, the annexation ordinances of the state of Tennessee have been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7335)|
| 2:02:21| I call that Urban Growth Boundary Act that required the establishment of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| after my friend Victor Ashe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| I called it the Victor Ashe Bill because of the way he handled annexations for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| which involved going out corridors, Chapman Highway, Kingston Pike, even Fort Loudoun Lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7355)|
| 2:02:44| to acquire properties that, by using the finger annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| would be construed as contiguous to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| Well, this statute was adopted in response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| But subsequently, today, a property owner cannot be annexed by a municipality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| be it the town of Farragut, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| or any other municipality in the state of Tennessee unless the property owner requests it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7386)|
| 2:03:15| So, in effect, the state has repealed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Now, I know Mr. Armstrong, the law director, has requested an opinion from the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7398)|
| 2:03:25| or has had one of the legislators to request an opinion from the Attorney General on this very issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7405)|
| 2:03:33| but has not heard back on that as of a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| I think Mr. Sanders can confirm that we have heard nothing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| So, I think being guided by a plan that is not being implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7423)|
| 2:03:50| i.e. being reviewed every three years, with a committee in place to, as it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7430)|
| 2:04:00| if the plan is to be amended, time will not be lost making appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| and we don't even have a committee that can make amendments to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| It's hampering the growth of Knox County, especially along the Pellissippi Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7449)|
| 2:04:17| in this instance on Choteau Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| and I think you will start feeling the effects of this up at Harbison's Crossroads, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| which is facing the growth pressures with the new middle school you all are building up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7465)|
| 2:04:33| So, we would simply ask for 3.27 units per acre, which is eight additional houses in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7473)|
| 2:04:43| 3.3 or 3.7? What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| 3.27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| 3.27, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| Did you have the total number of residences versus the total number of residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7490)|
| 2:05:00| Was there eight residences difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| Yes, between the three and the 3.27. Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| Yeah, seven or eight residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| I need to get this in the record, so you're asking for 68?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| No, no. 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| Ryan, come up here and help me out on my math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| While you're engaged in your math, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7524)|
| 2:05:30| Is there anyone else present who wishes to speak to the issue at hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7530)|
| 2:05:37| Is there anyone else who wishes to speak to the issue at hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7537)|
| 2:05:45| Observing none, let me go back now to the total number of residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| Total number of residents, Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| Please say that again, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| What we'd like to request is the density to be at 3.27 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| which would equate to 89 single-family detached dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| Versus 81.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| Versus 81 at three units to the acre, which is what MPC is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7572)|
| 2:06:21| The plan that was submitted to MPC and approved, the concept plan that's approved currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| proposed us meeting the three units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| We didn't change any roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| All we did was start deleting lots out to get down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| So the actual roadway and design of the subdivision wouldn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7596)|
| 2:06:44| I believe Commissioner Gill is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| I missed the total acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| 27.3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| I think Commissioner Brantley and I were actually in the audience during the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| when they first went for this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| And please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| but the unanimous decision from the MPC commissioners was that they did not want to violate the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7633)|
| 2:07:22| and that's why they set it at three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| There was quite a bit of discussion regarding the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| and they did vote to approve the matter at three units per acre as limited by the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7652)|
| 2:07:38| Right, because they didn't want to violate state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Even the developer on the MPC commission voted three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7661)|
| 2:07:50| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| If I could just ask Deputy Law Director David Buch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7675)|
| 2:08:00| he was very much involved in the Urban Growth Policy Coordinating Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| Do you feel that this statute has been set aside by the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| I agree with Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| I think there is a doctrine in law when it comes to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| because with legislatures you have laws that are passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| This was 13, what, let's see, 2000 to 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| 16 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| When did they pass the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| But then just within the last two years they passed the statute that says no more annexations, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7716)|
| 2:08:43| unless it's by request of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| I think that there's two things, that there's a doctrine of implied repealer in legislative actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7726)|
| 2:08:54| I believe and I agree with Arthur that that is a case here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7734)|
| 2:09:03| because, number one, nobody's followed that statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7743)|
| 2:09:08| and that makes it invalid in my mind in and of itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| because these factors could have been dealt with in every three years as they're brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| And then when the state legislature, the slamming door for me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| when the state legislature passed the new anti-annexation statute that says no more annexations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7762)|
| 2:09:30| and all of this growth policy had to do with cutting off the Victor Ashe approach to annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7770)|
| 2:09:37| Since that's not an issue, bottom line to me is it's an implied repealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7777)|
| 2:09:45| And then also, what was the reasoning then, if you were waiting for a decision from the Attorney General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7785)|
| 2:09:52| that you went ahead on, it's not me guys, if you appeared before the MPC on, I'm not touching anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7792)|
| 2:10:04| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| Then what was the reasoning to appear on July 13th at the MPC to submit your documents for the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7811)|
| 2:10:20| and the use on review based on a total of 82 lots, which is three units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| At that time, MPC had made a recommendation, Commissioner, for three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| and we did file one that went for the 3.27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| They said take out the eight lots, and we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Why didn't you just defer it for 30 days until we could make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| and then you would apply for the August meeting based on what decision is made here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| Well, we wanted to go ahead because of contractual arrangements to make sure we're pushing the process through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7852)|
| 2:11:00| and one of the triggering events is the rezoning, I think, on that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7860)|
| 2:11:07| So if we are successful at 3.27, we will amend our concept plan and go back to MPC for their September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7867)|
| 2:11:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| I just want a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| There was a mention of the law being broke, and I was on, again, on the MPC at the time we did the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7886)|
| 2:11:36| I didn't think it was urban growth law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| It was guidelines of how you develop your future property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| and it seems like we're now using that to beat people over the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| But am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7908)|
| 2:11:49| There was no law passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| It was just said we had to do that as a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| Was that right, Mr. Booth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| The statute required all the county's municipalities to enter into a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| The one in Knox County was particularly brutal and bloody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| because if the three entities, Farragut, City of Knoxville, and the county couldn't agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| and everybody was in agreement except Victor Ashe did not want to agree anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| and so step two was it had to go to Nashville for a mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| And there was a very brutal and bloody battle over there with the mediators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| and then finally what came out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| and I don't recall whether it was a mediation or an arbitration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| was this plan, as you say, Commissioner Busford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| it is a plan that was agreed upon amongst the three entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| And so that's not the law in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| That was the plan that was agreed upon, if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| We as a commission have struggled with this for a couple of years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| because Knox County has grown to the point that we've brushed up against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| these expandable sections of the county that are limited by rural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| Now, I have a lot of respect for the MPC Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| but one thing that the MPC Commission doesn't have to worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| is being the funding body for roads and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| And we've let this handcuff us in the amount of tax we're going to be able to generate in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8003)|
| 2:13:29| and I'm ready to try and see if someone's willing to go slightly over it to see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8009)|
| 2:13:39| Seeing I do not see other continued discussion, I need to ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8019)|
| 2:13:48| are there any other questions by my fellow commissioners of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8028)|
| 2:13:56| Seeing no further questioning of the presenters, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8036)|
| 2:14:03| I'll make a motion to accept the MPC recommendation of three dwelling units per acre for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8043)|
| 2:14:11| now it's called the Woods at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8051)|
| 2:14:18| I would make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| 3.27, and let's vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8060)|
| 2:14:29| Wait a minute, I don't know that I have a second on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| Is there a second on the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| There is a second on the original motion per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8080)|
| 2:14:47| I entertain a substitute motion at 3.27 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8087)|
| 2:14:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8095)|

| 2:15:48| I was going to say, I think they've taken steps to already meet with Dwight and start facilitating that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8148)|

| 2:23:02| Continuing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| 5-B-17-RC is a request of Marsh Dawn LLC for rezoning from RA Low Density Residential to PR Plan Residential at a density up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8584)|
| 2:23:17| Property located east side of North Campbell Station Road, south of El Rancho Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| This is in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| Representative of the applicant, could you give your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane, representing the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| Our request is as it was last month for the two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8615)|
| 2:23:43| I think you should have all have seen the concept plan that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| And I believe it addressed some of the concerns that we had at the meeting last month about how much we're going up the hill, what the maximum number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8628)|
| 2:23:57| I think there was a stream issue that we've had a determination made on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8637)|
| 2:24:02| And again, I think there was a question on exactly how many lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| And you see there's 22 on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| Our reasoning, again, just to kind of go back over this, the property is currently zoned RA, which are 10,000 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8648)|
| 2:24:17| And so what the PR zoning allows us to do is shrink the entire footprint of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| We could go with 10,000 square foot lots and get this to work at 22 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8663)|
| 2:24:28| But the PR allows us to go to somewhere between 7,000 and 8,000 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| which really squeezes us down and lets us get off that hillside and get away from some of the things on the property that we also see as issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8673)|
| 2:24:42| So we would ask that you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| I understand that there was a comment last time about 24 or whatever, and we're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8685)|
| 2:24:52| But we think we've addressed those concerns with this concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8692)|
| 2:24:58| We've stayed off the hill, we've protected the stream, and we've definitely limited the units to what we talked about limiting them to last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8698)|
| 2:25:05| So I would ask for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| Mr. Kelly, do you wish to make comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| The Planning Commission did recommend approval of the planned residential at a maximum of two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8710)|
| 2:25:17| As requested, the matter was heard on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| I appreciate the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| That gives us advance notice of what's taking place, helps us look at what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| and also I think did away with the misconcept that there was originally a different developer, a high wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8727)|
| 2:25:37| and in this development a wall of only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| Yeah, so the one that was the wall, and you were right and I was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8742)|
| 2:25:49| We had done an extremely preliminary layout just to see what it was looking like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| and there was a wall on there, and that's one I'd forgotten about because we did it early, early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8754)|
| 2:25:59| It was not economically viable, and so we went back and started doing some other things as far as grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| The only walls that may be on here, we're talking about the possibility of a three- or four-foot wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| along North Kimball Station in different places depending on what our dirt availability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| That helps get our lots at a better elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| If we like dirt, instead of having to haul stuff in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| we can kind of build some of these almost decorative walls in the back of units for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=8779)|

| 2:35:28| The letter was from Chairman Wright to Travis Fuller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| Who was it returned to, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| I don't know that the letter came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| Did it come back to the office, the service of the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| Are we going to follow the procedure that we have in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| The certified letter was never delivered by the post office, else we would have received the return service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9345)|
| 2:35:53| So I renew my motion to say let's defer one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9362)|
| 2:36:03| Are we going to resend the letter? I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| We will make some phone calls this time. I will make phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| Even on a certified letter, if they miss the delivery at the home or the address, there's a note left that they've got to go to the post office and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9370)|
| 2:36:21| So it's not the commission's fault, it's Travis Fuller's fault for not following through, because I guarantee the post office notified in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9381)|
| 2:36:32| My only question is, did we get that certified note back from the post office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9392)|
| 2:36:38| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| I agree with you, we've got to wait another month. If we got it back, there's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| And I sent regular mail as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| Can Drusilla say what she's done procedurally wise, so we all can hear it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9408)|
| 2:36:55| Yes, speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| I don't have a mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| I sent a certified mail and I also sent regular mail. I did not receive the green card back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| You did not receive the green card back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9425)|
| 2:37:10| So she sent it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| She sent it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9432)|
| 2:37:16| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| She's indicated that she sent the letter, both certified and regular mail, that the green card did not come back for the certified mail, but that the regular mail sent to that address was not returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9438)|
| 2:37:30| So it indicates that they received the regular mail but didn't sign it for the certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9450)|
| 2:37:38| He's not a first timer either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9458)|
| 2:37:43| The regular mail is not indicative of we had the right address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9463)|
| 2:37:54| I have residential mailboxes near me that are full of stuff that nobody picks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9474)|
| 2:38:03| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9483)|
| 2:38:04| It seems to me we fulfilled our duty to try to contact them and if they wanted this to be heard, they would eventually show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9484)|
| 2:38:10| Obviously they're not ready to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| So let it ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9492)|
| 2:38:15| We've done our duty and then take it off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| I think the question that's raised by Commissioner Smith is that this is two separate people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9499)|
| 2:38:27| One is the developer and one is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| If we throw this out, then the property owner can't come back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9510)|
| 2:38:36| And it may not be their fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| That's if we deny zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| If it dies, it's not a rezoning, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| I think our rule said we would deny it, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9521)|
| 2:38:44| Oh, I'm not in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| Yeah, the rule says we would deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9526)|
| 2:38:58| Just let us pause for just a second, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9538)|
| 2:39:07| What are you saying about the county internet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9547)|
| 2:39:37| Mr. Chairman, can I ask a question in the meantime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9577)|
| 2:40:03| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| It's not a first timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| He's done a few transactions in Knox County before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| I just called his phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| I got his voicemail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| I left a message for him to give me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9619)|
| 2:40:23| The commission rules state that in this circumstance that the application shall be deemed withdrawn unless the commission votes otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9623)|
| 2:40:32| When they fail to appear and it's moved to the next agenda and they fail to appear again, it's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9632)|
| 2:40:39| And that doesn't hurt the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9643)|
| 2:40:47| Withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| Do you want to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| Who wants to make a motion to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9652)|
| 2:40:55| By rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| By rule, we automatically withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9657)|
