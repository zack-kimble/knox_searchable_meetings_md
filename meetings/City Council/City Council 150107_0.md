| 0:02:25| of all, I hope that everybody had great holidays, whatever holiday you celebrate, and that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| weren't celebrating that with family and friends, and I wish you all a Happy New Year. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| we're going to have some very exciting things happening in the city this year. They're already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| going with the President visiting on Friday and lots of different activities. So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=161)|
| 0:02:48| looking forward again to work with Council. We had a good year last year. We're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| preparing our year-end report. All the departments have done that, and you should be seeing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| soon. But we look forward to another great year and appreciate our City Council and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| work that you all do with us. I do also want to recognize and welcome, we have the Interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| Executive Director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, Jeff Welch, who's with us. Please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| stand, Jeff. He's been on, is this day two, I think, or so, of being the Interim Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=191)|
| 0:03:21| This is not a new role for him. He's actually been, as you all know, with MPC and Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| Planning Organization for some 30 years, and he has served in the Interim role. And, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| course, our Executive Director, Mark Donaldson, has retired, and we wish him much success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| and peace of mind and relaxation in retirement, as we all look forward to. And we also want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=218)|
| 0:03:45| to recognize Dan Kelly, who's sitting here, who is the Director of Development Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| for MPC. He's kind of the expert on zoning and has been doing that for 37 years. So I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| like to welcome Dan Kelly as well during this time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| And so between the two of them, we have 67 years of experience with the MPC. So any question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=241)|
| 0:04:11| you have, one or the other is going to be able to answer it. Correct? All right. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| he says okay. The answer is I'll look into it. Well, that's an answer. We'll research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| it. We hear that from the law department all the time. All right, a couple of important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| events I want to mention in the next few weeks. This Saturday, January 10th at 3 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| the City is hosting a special screening of the new film, Selma, and that is at the Regal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Cinema's Pinnacle Theater at Turkey Creek. This is the start of a series of events that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| we will be organizing this year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| Act of 1965. Most of Council actively participated in the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| Act, which was last year. We had a series of events. So this year, we want to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| the tremendous impact of Voting Rights Act of 1965. So the tickets to Selma, to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| special January 10th screening, are available for $8 for adults and $7.50 for children and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| senior citizens. The movie is rated PG-13. Before the screening, there will be a panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| discussion, a brief discussion, with local civil rights leaders who actually participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| at the grassroots level to register voters or at the national level at the White House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| with this whole issue of voting rights. The City is offering CAT bus transportation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| the movie. We will, since it's out at Farragut at Pinnacle, so we'll be leaving promptly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| from the Civic Coliseum parking garage at 2 p.m. on Saturday and returning about 6.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| p.m. And you can find information about how to RSVP. We do ask that you RSVP. If you call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=351)|

| 0:06:03| Saturday, January 10th at 3 p.m., the Selma premiere. And next week brings the annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=363)|

| 0:13:58| if Jeff can can maybe fill us in. It sounded like it sounded like. I'm going to ask Anne Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=838)|
| 0:14:06| to fill this in. Okay let's get Anne. Anne Wallace with the Redevelopment Department of the City will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=846)|
| 0:14:14| explain this. Hi good evening Mayor and Members of Council. As noted Anne Wallace with the Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| of Redevelopment 400 Main Street. This was a unique situation where a request had been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| for the hardship pertaining to the slope of the sidewalk versus the finished floor elevation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| the existing structure that is being renovated to make this property move forward to redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| and reuse. We're actually very pleased to see that a new property owner has come on board. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| property sat vacant for a number of years. So the variance is specific to the hardship of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| conflict between the finished floor elevation and the sidewalk. The reason being that the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| didn't move forward with the Board of Zoning Appeals is it requires three votes of affirmative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| action for an appeal to be granted. There were two votes, a motion and a second, but unfortunately we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| didn't have a full quorum of board members and one person had to recuse themselves. So we ended up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| a situation where the variance while approved by majority was not approved based on the operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| rules and procedures of the Board of Zoning Appeals. Thank you. Certainly. And in fact there's no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| that here to oppose it. There's no opposition to this as far as we are aware. That is our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| Okay all right any other questions Council? Thank you Ms. Wallace. So we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| to grant the appeal. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| 11a is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a sub-lease agreement with Associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=942)|

| 0:16:05| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 11b is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| into an agreement with the State of Tennessee Department of Transportation for the installation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| operation, and maintenance of a traffic signal at the intersection of I-75 southbound and Callahan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| Road. Move to approve. Second. Councilman Dela Valle. Yeah Jim if I could ask Jim Hagerman a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| question. Sure. Talk into your microphone please. Jim there's a there's a I know there's a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=987)|
| 0:16:35| light when you're going northbound and it and that's a pretty busy intersection actually it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| often queues up. You're doing the same thing on the other side. Is the state building this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| and then we just take it over or what is the exact relationship? Jim Hagerman, Director of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| Engineering for City. You are correct. The state is building it. We're taking it over. TDOT doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| own any signals. They'll install them where they see it as appropriate and it's certainly within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| their purview when you're talking about getting off of the ramp onto a surface street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| So they're building it and the one at the at the west end which is southbound off-ramp southbound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| on-ramp it's pretty busy. It's it's a good place for a signal. They're also reconfiguring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| intersection somewhat so there's going to be two left turn lanes onto the southbound ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| but yeah you you are correct that the state builds it. We take over operation. Will this be one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| the ones that we'll be looking at along with other signals to modernize controls and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| It'll be somewhat far down on that list since it will have new hardware in it so and it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| let me let me consider this before I say it out loud but it's it's there are fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| signals on that corridor so communication won't be as as important. Okay. Probably you'll probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| want to synchronize it with the one at the other end of that bridge. So you can move that traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| out of the way. Okay well thank you. Thank you. Okay we have a motion and a second. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 11c is a resolution authorizing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1099)|

| 0:19:35| moved. Second. Okay um we uh we have two people signed up to speak. Do you want to hear them now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| before we get into discussion? Sure. Okay those two are Mark Taylor and Kevin Faddis. Do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| the consultant here too or not? Uh no the consultant is not here tonight. Okay. But uh Vicki Hatfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| Jim York and staff are all here to answer questions. So Mr. Taylor uh please come down and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| as you know uh you have up to five minutes. I'll set the timer and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1200)|
| 0:20:13| Mark Taylor 720 Hall of Fame Drive. I'm the fraternal order of police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| president for volunteer lodge number two here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| I'd like to talk for a second about communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| What I try to do every time I speak for our people is I try to provide our decision makers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| with not a demand or a specific request for a resolution to a problem because I don't supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1235)|
| 0:20:43| to be a city council person. I'm not qualified. I'm a police representative. What I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| is police work and I know police. So what I try to do is I try to as best I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1250)|
| 0:21:00| uh give folks an understanding of what it means maybe the the gritty understanding of what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| means to be a police officer. Some of the challenges of that and uh but of course in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| communication there's always the chance that it'll fail and there's a lot of reasons it'll fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| So I try to use an example with retention to help folks understand some of the unique challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| that I think our guys perceive or that I perceive and I try to use that as a basis to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| stimulate thought about a broader issue and but there's always that danger that folks don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| understand what you're saying or they don't get the point you're trying to get across and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| I've done that the last time I spoke to you. So I wanted to take a chance and just publicly say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1304)|
| 0:21:54| and and let you know where I where I was on that and how I feel about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| If you focus specifically on the numbers or the illustrations that I give then you probably missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1319)|
| 0:22:07| the meat of what I was trying to tell you and that's not good because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| I can understand outside folks missing that or whatnot but you're my audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| and the folks that make decisions about our people. So what I'm trying to say to you when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| I talk about those things or if I talked about clearing a function a level two malfunction on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| the Sig P220R emergency response driving is that I believe policing is a exceptionally difficult job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1346)|
| 0:22:36| even on a good day and I believe right here we have some of the best police officers and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| best public servants that you'll find anywhere in the nation. I've served in the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| I've served overseas, I've served in combat overseas and I've known some really great people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| and honest to God I put these people that I work with each day against probably any of them. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| believe you have that level of service and I'm humbled to have the opportunity to even speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| on their behalf. So the last thing I want to do is give the wrong impression or not do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1387)|
| 0:23:16| effectively. That weighs on me heavily. So what I was trying to say last time when I spoke to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| about retention I was trying to give you an example that you could frame that from. I think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| great people. I think they do a great job. I think Knoxville is a great place to work and I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| probably have one of the best police departments, some of the very best people right here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| I support the mayor's proposal not because I agree with every bit of it or as if I was mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| if I was supposed to such a lofty dream it's how I would do it. I don't. But at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1424)|
| 0:23:52| like I told her I believe it's a fair proposal that attempts to address a problem. That it kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| of moves us in the right direction towards competitive wages with our peers. And I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| that we have great employees. They're already here. This is a good start on that path. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| as always I'm not supposed to tell you a dollar figure or a course of action or anything but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| would greatly appreciate any consideration that you give to the employees that I'm elected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| represent. And I know they greatly appreciate it too. Thank you for your time and we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| your consideration. Thank you Mark. Next is Kevin Faddis. Thank you for being here and I'll set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1473)|
| 0:24:41| timer. Thank you. Excuse me I got the flu. I'm kidding kidding. Kevin Faddis 614 North Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1481)|
| 0:24:53| Street and I'm the Firefighters Association representative. I want to start out by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| number one I support we support not just I but the Firefighters Association supports the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| proposal. As Mark said not because it's everything we agree with but it's something that we met over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| and over and over as Vicki and Jim York and Dr. Lyons and Mark and Michael Passeur and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| can tell you. We're definitely not going to get everything we want in the world. Life's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| It is what it is but we think we're moving forward on this. The two gentlemen from MPC that have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| combined total of over 60, 65 was it? 67 years. 67 years. That's not an anomaly. That's because these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| guys like what they do and apparently they want to be paid fairly as well. We want the same. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| don't want this to be a job. It's a career for us. We swore to uphold, protect, save, help the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1547)|
| 0:25:56| community. That's what we want. That's all. Nothing more, nothing less. So I'd hope that City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| supports this. Doesn't pick it apart. We want to move forward with what the mayor's proposed and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| certainly thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you, Kevin. Okay, council discussion. Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1569)|
| 0:26:19| Yeah, thank you, Mayor. I appreciate you bringing this forward. I can remember back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| probably since 1994 hearing these discussions and I know I see some folks out there that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| probably scoff at 1994. They've been thinking about this for a long time but I think it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| right thing to do at this given point in our history here. Mr. Taylor talked about retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1601)|
| 0:26:50| and then it was written in the paper that, you know, it was very low turnover. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| if you take one percent or whatever it was, that's four or five uniformed bodies a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| that's still getting close to a half a million dollars. And if you keep, you know, rolling that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| eventually that gets to real money. So this does play into, you know, retention. And I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| fair for our employees to be paid equal to the peers in like communities. So again, the timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1635)|
| 0:27:25| I mean, I would like for it to flow, you know, more through the budget process. But as they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| the longer we wait, the further behind we get. So I'm going to support tonight moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| with this. And again, thank you for bringing it forward. Thank you. Councilman Delahopey. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| thank you, Mayor. I had several questions. Maybe they're best addressed to Vicki. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| whether we're 100 percent done with our consultant's work. Some of the information that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| all presented at the workshop indicated that we were getting additional data as early as March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| and that it was sort of better to have two years of data in the analysis than one year and it left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| you a little iffy. Are we going to make any attempt to do that, to put that additional data into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| analysis? Vicki Hatfield, Civil Service Director. The data I was talking about is the data that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| do every year in our salary survey. Yeah, our normal survey takes place in the fall. The data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| is actually in and being analyzed now. I'll consult with the mayor in March on that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| That's actually one of the reasons this is unusual timing for this request. But this request is based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| on data that was collected prior to July. Our salaries and everyone we surveyed salaries changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| in July. If we wait another July, we've now gotten farther behind on the data. So that's why it was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| recommendation to go ahead and make these changes based on that old data now. We'll have our survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| in and we can look at that in the spring for our normal budget cycle to see if any additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| changes are necessary. We would do those with the normal cycle in July. Okay, second question is, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| didn't understand why the report said it wasn't going to look at cost of living in the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1753)|
| 0:29:21| cities. But we have some big cities in there that include some in Virginia and, you know, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| Lexington, Kentucky and places, Nashville, Memphis, places where the cost of living might be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| And that certainly bears on the amount of wage you need to to keep up in terms of what ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| to pay your bills and, you know, and run your home operation. Why did he not put that in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| somehow? I can't really speak for Mr. Sussels. I did have this conversation with him. So I can at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| least tell you what my conversation with him was. When we got the first draft data back and I saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| the geographic adjustment as opposed to a standard cost of living adjustment, I did question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| The thing where the labor costs were higher in some cities. Yeah, they basically use a cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| labor versus a cost of living. And his response basically was that's the methodology they use and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| that was the methodology they were going to use. And that was not up for discussion. That's part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| their art. That's simply, yeah, that's simply what they do and there was really no give on that. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| was simply the way they do it and they would not consider doing it differently. All right. The next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| question is why did he use only normal employer contributions to pension as opposed to actual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| Because that bears on. I think that's a Jim question. Is that a Jim question? Okay. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| thank you for your part. Jim, take the Jim question. Jim York, finance director. The reason that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| would use normal cost in comparing pension is that's the best way you can get to an accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1857)|
| 0:31:07| comparison. And even that is somewhat difficult because people use different rates of return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| assumptions and so forth so you don't have a clean match there. But if you're going to try to compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| pension from a cost perspective, you would use normal contribution rather than what your actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| contribution is because different people have different unfunded liabilities and that's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| not a true comparison between pension systems. Okay. I have one more Vicki question if I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| answer that. I assume it's a Vicki question. It might be a Jim question. Well, you ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| question and they'll figure out who's best qualified to answer. They'll sort it out. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| A question arose, I think it was at the workshop, but certainly in the process of looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| And, of course, everyone wants to look at, you know, what's a fair wage? How are we doing? Are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| we competitive? All those kinds of questions. Why do we do this and then not talk about some kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1920)|
| 0:32:09| of pro-rate adjustment to, like, automatic pay increases or things that are outside of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| salary? In other words, if we're going to put everyone on sort of a, you know, a medium type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1935)|
| 0:32:24| wage as a minimum, why then do we have some automatic levers on the side that don't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| accounted for in this process? Are you referring to basically pay supplements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| things that get, any of the other things that get added? Right. And I noticed they looked at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| of them. I have the full report and it was really exciting to read, I want to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| several hundred pages. They did include that. That's one of the reasons. Thank us for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| sleep you received. There's tons of pages. We did ask them to do that. The reason even Mercer didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1967)|
| 0:32:56| roll pay supplements into the total comp, in my understanding from what they say, is it is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| difficult methodology. We have an educational incentive. Someone else may have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| different. It's just not apples to apples. You can't find good comparisons and there's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| good methodology to account for it. So typical compensation, it's always just base pay to base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| pay. So that is one of the things that, you know, I do take a look at. I did take a look at how do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| our supplemental pays compare to some of the others and I do feel like we have some richer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| supplements than others. That was part of, that was one of the reasons that my recommendation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| that we go to the 95th rather than to the to 100 percent because those things were not accounted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| for and I do feel like those things matter and I felt like we were in a very good marketable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| position on those items. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Palmer. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| Mayor. I too, when we got the data and looked at the numbers and all, had a couple of sleepless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| nights and gave this a lot of thought. I would like Vice Mayor Pavlis to be more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| if we were doing this during the normal budget cycle but I really do understand that it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| hurrieder we go, the behinder we get. So I'm going to be supporting this tonight but I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| concerned that we not set a precedent to do this at mid-budget in the future. Yeah and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2060)|
| 0:34:29| I asked Jim about that. There's the city on occasion this has happened and I will raise this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| now because a couple of council members have asked me. So Jim, do you want to talk about where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| in the past, in past administrations when this was done? A few examples anyway. Changes in salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2079)|
| 0:34:48| from across the board and that's what I would call this, are somewhat rare but they have occurred in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| the past. The best example that I've found was in 1992, in January of 1992. We'd had an across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2095)|
| 0:35:04| board increase in July of 1991 and we had a subsequent across the board increase in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| of 1992 and then we had another increase in July of 1992. In 2003, this one is not quite the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2111)|
| 0:35:22| but we had an adjustment in October that was really a delay of the two and a half percent salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| increase. My memory tells me that we did that retroactively but I can't find any documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| and the civil service person says that she can't find any documentation as well but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| my memory says that that we did that retroactive back three months. And then the third example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| would be in January of 2011. That's when we implemented the third year of the Mercer plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2147)|
| 0:35:55| at that point in time. So it has happened in the past. Again, it's not a commonplace experience but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| this is not a precedent setting. And just counsel from my perspective as mayor, it's not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| that I would see us routinely doing. It's not something that I would wish to do but considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| that we budgeted for this, it was the 13-14 budget year that we actually approved the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2174)|
| 0:36:23| study to occur and ideally those numbers would have informed the current budget year, the 14-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| So really this is something that should have gone into effect seven months ago and as Vicki mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| you know, the longer you wait, then the numbers are older and older or the figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| So this is something that really should have happened July 1 if we had had the study back by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| then. And so we're really trying not to get further behind as has been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| But it's not something that we would see as a routine action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2213)|
| 0:37:01| Councilman Wallace. Yes, thank you mayor. And my comments are right on the same lines with Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| and Pavlis. You know, this is something that typically we look at annually and not mid-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| and that's really been my only angst. It's not about trying to, I think you need to be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| fair and competitive salaries. I have no issue with that. I supported the study to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| salaries. I support it and I would support it again today. That's the right thing to do. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| looking at it in January is the only thing that gives me angst. And then you couple that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2252)|
| 0:37:40| we're going to be looking at it again in a couple more months and more salary increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| My preference would have been to do it one time, to look at increases one time as opposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| you know, having to look at it again. I totally agree. The professional, everybody I've met on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| the fire and police have been nothing but professional and the best of the best. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| qualm that at all. I just think the timing of it and how to implement it is probably more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| Aspect of it. It did not surprise me at all that the general government salaries were much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| in line with the public. Because I've seen in my business and businesses that I track that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| seen salaries go down since we're adjusted in 9 and 10 and 11. And they've begun to come back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2301)|
| 0:38:29| and we're paying more today for entry level positions than we were in 9 and 10. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| doesn't surprise me to see that there's fewer adjustments there where you're really competing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| head to head with public. Where in the other, in the fire and police, not so much. So that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| surprise me. And so there's fewer adjustments. So I support it. I support the people. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| support the timing of it. And I wish that part was different. But it is what it is, as Mr. Faddis said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2333)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you. Thank you. I also want to, you know, I said this is really should have happened July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| But Vicki, would you address it really, particularly I think for firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| is something that's been several years that we have known that has not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| Would you talk to that, Vicki, about Mercer and how somehow the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| This is basically a kind of, in my opinion, it's a follow-up to Mercer. Mercer was a big study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| We took big actions and we committed to follow up about five years later and kind of test it and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| how we did. Did we get it right? Did we need to make further adjustments? How did we look on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| broader scale? And so we've done our normal survey that we do, which is not a total compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| It's just base pay survey. But we've done that survey every year since 2008. And 2008 was when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| we started implementing the Mercer changes. And the pattern I've seen with general government since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| 2008 is that general government has been at market. We have made almost no adjustments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| the structures in general government, and that's the reason. So for whatever reason, when we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| Mercer, they got it right on general government. Police and fire, the very first year we did our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| survey after Mercer, police and fire were already a little bit low. And the next year, in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| they were a little bit lower. Every year since Mercer, I have found police and fire to be below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| market. I have not found it to be 12 percent below. Police, we've averaged about five or six percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| below. And on fire, about eight percent below. That's another reason that I'm not recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| we go to 100 percent of the Siegel survey, because that was one data survey. And I'm more of a let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| look at several years of data kind of person, and I want to go with a consistent pattern. And I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| like the 95 percent sort of hits closer to what we've been seeing since Mercer. So these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| changes that have been needed for quite some time, but we wanted to have a trend and a pattern to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| that these weren't just sort of a knee-jerk reaction to one year of data. So this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| that's been supported for many years. And I do understand, you know, the concern with the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| Normally, as the mayor said, our survey would have been completed in the spring, and any adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| would have been proposed with the regular budget. But because we didn't get the results from Siegel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| until August, we simply weren't able to do that. So we're really just trying to do this as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| as we're able to from when we receive those results. Thank you, Ms. Hatfield. Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| Thank you, Mayor. I support the comments made by Wallace, Palmer, and Pavlis. I won't repeat them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| We've got great employees, but I did have a timing question. You mentioned we received, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| it is important to do it this year, we received the report in August. What was the delay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| bringing it to us until now, five months later? Basically, it was everything that had to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| place between August and December. We got the data at the end of August. The actual first, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| draft of the survey that I received was August 20th. So we're actually talking the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| Because we had an executive committee and we had the extended committee that included the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| and fire chief and the three employee reps, we then had to bring Siegel back in so that Siegel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| could present the results. So I didn't even start working on the recommendations until after Siegel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| had come in, gone through the results. Everybody was happy with the survey. We determined there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| wasn't anything else we wanted them to do. We didn't have any issues or questions about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| So by the time that process was finished, we were up into the fall. So it wasn't until we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| finished and it had been communicated to the group and we all agreed the survey is final, it is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| that I could even sit down and go through making the recommendations. At that point, then I started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| working with Jim and the mayor to go through those recommendations. And it literally was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| the amount of time that it took to go through that process and then get Siegel back in to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| workshop. The earliest we were able to do that was December. So it was really, part of it was working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| with a consultant who was in Washington and we only had limited access to when he could be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| and working with a larger group than I'm used to working with. Usually it's me and Jim sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| down with a bunch of paper. So just trying to coordinate with more bodies and a timeline that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| we didn't have complete control over. Thank you. And I had a question for Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| We had talked, I mean, my frustration was the same as Mr. Della Volpe's about the actual numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| being used. And a bigger frustration of mine is when I reviewed the numbers for the other city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| it appeared that they submitted their actual numbers and not their normal numbers. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| what your impression of the numbers, Mr. York? In terms of pension, my impression of the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| that were submitted is that we did not get a clean comparison on pension. Again, some of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2649)|
| 0:44:18| you see some outliers where people say that their normal contribution is 30 and 40 percent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| that's clearly out of line with anything in the marketplace. And so they probably submitted what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| their actual contribution would be, which would be the normal contribution plus the unfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| actuarial liability contribution. So, and again, if you take a look at the kinds of surveys, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2677)|
| 0:44:47| it's understandable. You ask this kind of question, you almost have to go to somebody that deals with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| this, you know, fairly frequently. And again, I think Ms. Hatford would agree that if they asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| civil service this question about normal contribution that they, she would probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| you know, give an incorrect answer. So you really have to refer to either pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| or the finance people who are working with this daily and understand the difference between normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| contribution and unfunded actuarial contribution as well. Right. And so it's not a true apples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| to apples comparison, even though that's difficult with any defined benefit pension contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| Yeah, and again, you know, we have talked before. I think this, in terms of the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| sometimes we're comparing a kumquat to an orange or a grapefruit. But even in normal contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| what you have is you can't, it's hard to do it because people use different discount rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| And if you don't have consistency of discount rates, the plan configuration, certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| like that, then you're going to have, you know, bad comparisons. If what the survey did is what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| think we just discussed, if it used a normal contribution rate for Knoxville and then for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| many of the other cities used their actual contribution rate was much higher, wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| that make our pension benefit look relatively less compared to the other cities? Our contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| rate, if somebody is using, you know, their total contribution and we're using the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| contribution, that's probably going to make us look under, you know, priced, I guess, in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2785)|
| 0:46:35| of pension contributions. If we use what our total contribution is, you'll find that we're pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| comparable to, again, the Chattanoogas, probably Memphises and so forth in terms of total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| contribution, which is up in the 40% range. Right. Okay. Thank you. And as I said, the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2808)|
| 0:46:56| today just deals with base salary and, of course, I think that's, anybody that's ever received a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| paycheck, I mean, I think that's the most important thing. And I think it's something we certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| have to address. I'm going to be supporting and I just wanted to discuss some of the frustrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| I had with the survey, but I will be supporting. We have terrific fire and police department in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| those agencies and our turnover is low and we need to do what we can to keep it low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Grave. Thank you, Mayor. This has been a real struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| in terms of when it comes to pay because just like Mr. Faddis and Mr. Taylor mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| who you represent, you know, we're also the representative of the taxpayer, as you're well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| aware. And that doesn't mean that we don't think that you don't do a good job and that you're an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| excellent group and this sort of thing, but we do have that struggle where we have to balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| between the two. And just like my colleagues have said, I'm not going to repeat everything that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| said. I think, George, you did a great job in terms of expressing myself. And I do think I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| struggled with the timing of this. I do hope that when it does come time for a budget review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| we look at not only the salaries, but we also look at the automatic pay increase that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| giving. I think this is something that we need to look into. I know a number of people have called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| me about this and I think it's something that we ought to review and see whether or not that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| right way to go. I don't really have any problem with what's on the table before us. I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| ask Mr. York, though, a question. Jim, I was a little bit taken back with your answer when you said we can find the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| when we talked about it. And it sounded as though that we had this fluid budget that if we really want something done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2917)|
| 0:48:47| we can find the money. So I think it would be a good idea if you could explain exactly how the budget works and why we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| have some extra money at this time. The most significant thing this year, and again, we've talked about this before, is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2933)|
| 0:49:02| the cost of fuel. When we did the budget last year, we were basing it on estimates of around $110 a barrel of oil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2942)|
| 0:49:12| Now, again, I was a little bit concerned that right after we proposed it, it jumped to around $117 a barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2952)|
| 0:49:21| But since that time, we've seen a steady decline, and now we're looking at prices in the $50 a barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| Now, that translates into some significant dollar savings that we will see this year, primarily in terms of fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2969)|
| 0:49:38| The other area that we do tend to see, but it's not necessarily the case, is vacancies. The fire class, we have a fire class that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2978)|
| 0:49:48| going to start soon. We had anticipated that when we did the budget that it would start earlier than it actually is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| and so we'll see some savings in terms of expenditures there as well. But again, the big change is probably fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=2994)|
| 0:50:04| Now, if fuel was selling at $140 a barrel, we might be seeing something differently right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| But at this point, I think we're in good shape, and, again, fuel is the big savings that we will experience this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| Okay. Thank you. And then also, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| And anybody that knows Jim knows he's never flipping about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Yeah. Well, this is why I was kind of taken aback with his comment, because we do know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| So, anyway. And also, Mayor, I just want to thank you for your availability to be able to answer our questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| and this sort of thing, and I really appreciate that. So, thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Councilman Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Yeah. I think pretty much everything's aired except we left out one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| Jim, can you tell us the total cost of this ordinance change, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| or pay classification is about $925,000, or did I read the background material wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| I'm just trying to get the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| A full year worth of salary would be around $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| We're looking at, again, less than that because we're prorating it for five months out of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| The estimate, I think, is about $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Now, when you take benefits that we will pay on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| that you're going to, since this is primarily police and fire overwhelmingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| that will be around 1.5 times by the time you add benefits into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| So, you're looking probably at $600,000 for the balance of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| All right. And that last remark, what you're saying is by increasing the base salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| a lot of the other benefits key off that and you'll have a bigger base to multiply charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| Well, again, not all the benefits key off of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| but the big difference is obviously you've got Social Security and Medicare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| and that's 7.65%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| And the big difference is pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| And, again, our total contribution is around 42.5% for police and fire in terms of the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3112)|
| 0:52:00| So, you add those two together and you're up around 1.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| 1.5 times the base salary cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you so much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| So, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| Article 2 and Article 4 regarding floor area ratio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3149)|

| 0:52:33| and other area requirements for certain commercial zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| 12C is an ordinance approving the request of Cindy Bradley for an amendment to the North City sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| from civic institutional to office and low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| for property located on the northwest side of Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| northeast of Rowan Road, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Just for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| before we move on to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| I just do want to take a minute to thank Vicki Hatfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| to thank Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| Mark Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Kevin Faddis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| our two chiefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| for all the work that they put into this and bringing this to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| A lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| A lot of hours went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Thanks to all the employees who showed up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| I know you all need to get back to work or get some sleep so you can work tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| So thank you for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| So we have several people signed up to speak for and against this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3214)|
| 0:53:47| First we'll hear from the people who are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| Does Council want to go ahead or do you want to say something first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| I was going to ask that we go ahead and listen to the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| I was going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| and I'll defer to the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| if our law department would tell us what seems to me to be the pivotal question in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| I guess there are several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| But the pivotal question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| can we approve half a zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| And I just don't think legally we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| We have a system that has a map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| and then it has an ordinance that tells you what the map means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| And how do you find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| well, it doesn't really mean what the ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| It strikes me as we have gone beyond our authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| But I think that's an important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| If you want to wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| I'll be happy to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| Councilwoman Palmer has asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| I think she's right in asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| she wanted to hear from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| I'll be happy to hear the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| I just think that's something we need to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| You want to hear first, though, from the speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| And then we can let the lawyers define the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| Let's start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| The first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| those signed up to speak for this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| this trio of ordinances is Cindy Bradley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| followed by Arthur Seymour Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| and Betty Jo Mahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| So, Miss Bradley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| And as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| you have up to five minutes to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| and it's my job to keep you on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| So thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| My name is Cindy Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| I live at 1308 Fieldwood Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| within a half a mile of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| I have lived there for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| I worship in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| I belong to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| I have my business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| This is a very unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| It is an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| It was built out as an office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| through permits from the city of Knoxville in 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| It has not been a church since 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| It is an office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| 12,000 square feet on three acres of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| It is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| We are currently a non-conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| pre-existing use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| We want to make it legal so we can have signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| or financing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| You know, we intend to use it for offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| The issue of conditional zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| you know, I served on MPC for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| They were done as a routine matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| I would contend to you that even without conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| a one is the proper zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| It would be my wish for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| and as a member of that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| to not have this property become apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| which everything else in the neighborhood is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| up and down Cedar Lane, up and down Inskip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| up and down Highland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| and we have multifamilied this area to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| I would like to do something more productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| and more beneficial to the neighborhood with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| and I would ask your support in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Thank you, Ms. Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Betty Jo, do you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| You want Ms. Mahan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| If that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| I'm Betty Jo Mahan, 5325 Rowan Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| and I live about a block and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| from this particular building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| And the Inskip Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| started looking at this back in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| We looked at it in October and November, December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| The only objections that were to that was that we don't want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| she said, we don't want any more apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| We just did a general rezoning last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| to kind of down zone and keep so much density from our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| It's supposed to be multifamily use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| And this is such a pretty site and a nice area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| and a good building, and it just seems like a good use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| I know not everything fits every zone or every ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| and this is one of those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| where the best use for that particular building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| would be something like an office or some kind of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| and then the issue about it not having the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| that's funny because there was going to be a dance studio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| that was proposed to be in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| and they had some temporary signs up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| and I decided, well, I have my grandbaby that lives with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| and I thought, well, I'll call them and see what the program is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| and what age and stuff, and I drove by there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| and their signs were gone, so I couldn't call them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| because I had no way of knowing their number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| And so that would make it more useful, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| would be able to know who's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| and be able to call them and use their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| And the recommendation of office and professional only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| would let not only the Bradleys know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| but future owners of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| what the intended use of the property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| That's what, if you look at it in the long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| it would make better sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| because there's been questions about apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| and halfway houses and method-owned clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| and a lot of those which would be hard to put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| but there would be no question about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| if you put the condition on that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| Because, again, not every piece of property is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| and it has to be dealt with a little bit differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| And another thing that I found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| in talking about the dance studio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| because that would give our children in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| another activity, because we have a good park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| and a good ball field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| but they're on both ends of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| and this would be something like right in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| that children could walk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| and the offices might even provide jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| for some of the youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Because I was looking the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| and found out that 37% of our people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| living in the Enskip area are between the age of 20 and 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| and I kind of thought they were all older people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| So that was real interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| So there is still growth and vitality in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| and things do change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| and I just felt like this would be a good use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| for this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| And I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Thank you, Ms. Mayhem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| I'd like to know, are you speaking...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Ms. Mayhem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Are you speaking for yourself or the neighborhood association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Is the neighborhood association taking a position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| Yes, because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| we've talked about it since October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| and the only objection from anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| that I've talked to has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| no, we don't want any apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| and no, we don't want any halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| They didn't really have a problem with the office concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| That's the same thing that's popping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| about not wanting multifamily apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| That's the Enskip Neighborhood Association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Everyone I've talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| which obviously I can't talk to 4,313 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Councilman Palmer, do you still have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| All right, so next, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| Mayor, members of Council, Arthur Seymour, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| I am here on behalf of Mrs. Bradley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| and her husband, Rudy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| who requests that this rezoning be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| The property is presently zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| The city of Knoxville issued permits nearly 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| 25 years ago, 1985,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| that would retrofit what was once a church building for offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| and that was done openly and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| The property is not satisfactory for a residential of any type at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| It's not satisfactory for a halfway house or apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| It is, and Mrs. Bradley wants to use it for what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| has been permitted for, an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| She also has a great deal of interest, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| from a dance studio that wants to use part of the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| and she already has her own office building in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3727)|
| 1:02:14| The NSKIPP Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| has spent a long time looking at zoning in its neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| This started last year, actually the year before, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| with neighborhood meetings with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| to look at what would be the best zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| And after numerous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| including public meetings at the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| and two or three meetings here at City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| it's basically decided to try to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| a good part of the neighborhood single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| So this is a neighborhood that has been active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| thanks to Betty Jo's work and leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| in looking at what is the best zoning for properties in the NSKIPP area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| And Betty Jo has done the same thing when Mrs. Bradley went to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| I think she may have actually talked to her before she bought the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| to discuss her proposed use for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| and what would be good zoning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| And I think Betty Jo's remarks just a moment ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| indicate that she and her neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| concur with Mrs. Bradley's request for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| And I think that should be given a lot of weight in your deliberations tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| Now, the issue of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| MPC and you all have been doing this for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| Tonight there are four zonings on your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| one of which you just passed on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| in which you have imposed a condition on a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| This is something that has not generated any objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| until Mrs. Bradley's rezoning came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| which I suggest to you the objections to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| might be just an attempt to derail the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| I received an e-mail sent out to a number of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| in which it is alleged that this could be an adult strip club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| the Pink Pussycat or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| and if you all approve office here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| you'll find it in Holston Hills, Sequoia Hills and Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| I suggest the city already has ordinances on its books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| that deal with the location of adult businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| That would not allow it in the location of Mrs. Bradley's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| Halfway houses requires a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| The objectionable uses that have been raised require a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| Now, the question, I'm not going to speak for Mr. Swanson or Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3893)|
| 1:05:01| We may have a little disagreement on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| but I think there is certainly law that permits conditional zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| as long as it is imposed by the Planning Commission and you all, the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| Sir, you have 50 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| All right. Mrs. Bradley did not ask for the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Those were imposed, as I recall it, at the meeting by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| The Planning Commission imposed these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| The zoning map, when there are conditions imposed on the zoning, have a K on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| It's very easy to see where there are conditions imposed on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| Some have said, well, this is allowing commercial into the interior of a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| There are apartments everywhere which are commercial enterprises around this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| This is an office use, and that's what Mrs. Bradley wants, and we would ask that you all approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Okay, now to speak against these ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| We have Carlene Malone, Ryan Bradley, and Clark Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| Who's going first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3970)|
| 1:06:22| I'm Clark Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| I live at 1200 Stalewell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| I'm here representing my sister who lives at the intersection of Roland Road and Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3986)|
| 1:06:34| My sister and three or four of her, not everybody in the NSKIPP community agrees with the NSKIPP representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=3994)|
| 1:06:43| This is a prime example of spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| This particular property is approximately 900 to 1,000 feet east of the railroad track there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4006)|
| 1:06:57| West of the railroad track, there have been numerous restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| They're all tore down around the Ingalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| There was an olive garden, Orion's, the Texas Roadhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| And one of the reasons of those failures is this immense traffic from the interstate accessing the found city community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| It's very dangerous in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| This is a prime example of spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| They're concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| If we've got four businesses, we've got maybe four requests for signs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| And it's impossible to access off of Roland Road, Merchants Road, the peak flow hours in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4050)|
| 1:07:40| You can wait some time at Roland Road trying to access as much as 30, 45 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| particularly if there's a railroad train crossing Cedar Lane and Merchants Road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4065)|
| 1:07:58| All right. Thank you, Mr. Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| Mr. Bradley, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| Bradley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Is that her son?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| No relation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| Mr. Bradley, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| Yeah, I'm Ryan Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| I live at 601 Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| So I just want to say that it seems like it's being presented that everything around here is apartments and multifamily dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4108)|
| 1:08:38| and that what's being neglected is that we live right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4118)|
| 1:08:46| And there's a Griffins Gate community across the street as well that's all primarily single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4126)|
| 1:08:54| as well as several houses next to that and this gentleman's sister's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| I feel like I'm in public speaking in college again, so I've calmed myself a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| Just take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| You're doing fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| No grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Yeah, I know, right, but I'm on TV, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| Anyway, we all bought here knowing where we were buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| We bought knowing that we're in R1 residential, which is, I think, primarily a single-family dwelling zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4162)|
| 1:09:30| if I understand correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| So this is already zoned single-family, so I don't know why we're worried about turning into multifamily anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| because I feel like that would require rezoning too, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| I think R1 is single-family zoning already primarily, so I don't know why we're talking about multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4185)|
| 1:09:54| I've got here a sign of petition with over 30 single-family residences on there against rezoning to R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4194)|
| 1:10:07| Again, we all knew what we were getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| We all knew we were buying in R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Cindy Bradley knew we were buying in R1, and so she's already grandfathered in the usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| so I don't understand why it's necessary that we change things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| I think the railroad tracks has always been the dividing line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| and I feel like if we decide to rezone this property, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| at the NPC meeting there was a gentleman that was concerned that there had had multiple requests to rezone different properties along Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4235)|
| 1:10:44| and I feel like we're kind of opening up a can of worms here if we decide to rezone this property for other people to attempt to do so as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4244)|
| 1:10:55| Also, we just ask who this benefits in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| Again, I've got over 30 households here that are against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| and to me it seems like the primary benefit is to Cindy Bradley in this regard if we do rezone to R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4264)|
| 1:11:14| Additionally, the usages, she says that it's for signage, that she wants to put a different sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4274)|
| 1:11:24| and personally I believe that it's more related to the annex of the building that was for sale up until a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4284)|
| 1:11:35| so we're already looking at a threat to the usage restrictions there if we're talking about selling part of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4295)|
| 1:11:45| so that's concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| Just to summarize, we live in this community. We care about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| We would like to continue to have it as R1 zoning, single family usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| I would loud ask that you uphold the natural border of the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4322)|
| 1:12:09| and I feel like the benefit is greatest to more people to continue to keep it the way it is, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4329)|
| 1:12:18| Thank you. If you'd like to submit this, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| Mr. Lyons, Dr. Lyons, would you please take those and we'll get them to the recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| Thank you, Mr. Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| And now, Ms. Malone, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| I'm afraid I'm suffering from whatever voice thing that's going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| Members of Council, Mayor Carly Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| I'm here on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| The Board of Fountain City Town Hall asks that you deny the rezoning and plant amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| because the uses in O1, as MPC points out, are incompatible with surrounding zoning and land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| and bring about additional rezonings to R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| The requested changes are fundamental changes in zoning on Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| What is requested is not the extension of an existing office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| It's the introduction of office zoning in the middle of solidly residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| There are profound negative impacts from the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| In fact, MPC states that if the rezoning is put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| additional land ought to be rezoned southwest to the railroad tracks, Mr. Ryan Bradley's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| And it appears that that would indeed be necessary, that is to rezone other properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| because MPC says that the subject property that you're considering tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| will form only a, quote, portion of a transition zone, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| The remainder of the would-be transition zone will be formed by rezoning the additional property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| including Mr. Bradley's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| And MPC never contacted these additional owners, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| whose property they discussed in this plan, in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| Why even mention forming a transitional zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| The answer to that question is because without it, tonight's rezoning looks a lot like spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| which, in fact, is exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| MPC acknowledges that almost all of the uses in the O1 district are inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| their word, inappropriate, for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| And they prohibited 13 out of 15 permitted uses, and all 13 permitted uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4468)|
| 1:14:37| Is that what's going to be done for the other properties that will come up as rezonings in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4477)|
| 1:14:44| And it might be nice to think that, oh, well, once this council acts and prohibits those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| in the absence of any lawsuit or legal problems or mess-ups in enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| in the absence of all of that, it's wonderful to think that no other council is ever going to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| and say, oh, yeah, just one more use, let's go ahead and amend it to add this or to add that use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| that this, two uses out of 15, will be the full extent forevermore of the O1 property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| That's baloney, and you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| This is what I don't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| Why recommend rezoning to O1 if you believe that almost all of the uses are inappropriate for the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| And if this single zoning will necessitate rezoning additional properties to O1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| whose uses, again, are believed to be inappropriate for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| This is the weakest recommendation I have ever seen from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| and I've been reading recommendations since the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| The legally required standard that must be met in order to rezone has not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| According to MPC's own report, there are no changed or changing conditions in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| which is a required standard that must be met in order to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| MPC says that has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| What MPC appears to base its approval on is a, quote, trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| Quote, allowing a mix of more intense uses along arterial streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| particularly in areas with houses that rely on the arterial street for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| Office uses are similar in intensity to CI civic institutional uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| and are compatible with residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| Members of council, I don't know what a trend is, but I do know that a trend is not an adopted policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4586)|
| 1:16:34| You have one minute, Ms. Mullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| And a trend is too broad and too general to satisfy the standards required to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| As far as offices being similar in use and compatible to residential uses, let's be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| R1 allows churches and schools as permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| On review, R1 does not allow offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| A zoning ordinance reflects the values of a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| and we appear to see churches and schools in a different way than we see offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| The impact is more than mechanically counting cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| Please note this property is grandfathered for office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| The property is afforded all the protections under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| Members of council, Cedar Lane is the kind of area we are told repeatedly that we need more of in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| Provides a variety of housing types from single family detached to condos to apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| broad mix of housing and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Public transportation is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| The interstate access is convenient and in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| If we actually value the need for housing and the need for diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| then this is an area worthy of protection and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| Do not approve this rezoning and squander the opportunity for true progress in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| Thank you, Ms. Mullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| For these reasons, we ask that the plan amendment and rezonings be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Thank you, Ms. Mullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Okay, council, we've heard from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| I'm going to take it down a notch here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| She's got a lot of passion and we all appreciate it, Carly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| And, you know, this is a major artery that goes to Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| This is the NSKIPP community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| And, you know, I like Ms. Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| I've met with her and spoken with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| But regardless of her intentions, the long and short-term uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| I can't support at this time because of legal unknowns that involve conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4704)|
| 1:18:32| And I would like to call on Rob or Charles to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| But as I understand it, based on case law going back many decades in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| we can't condition the zoning to allow certain types of businesses while barring others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| You've got to compare apples to apples when you're talking about conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| So into an 01 zoning and for that, you know, I don't want to take a long-term chance for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| because what Ms. Bradley wants to do is well-intentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| We don't know that a decade from now or 15 or 20 years from now what might be challenged in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| So I guess at this time if Rob would like to say anything regarding case law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| or, you know, what we might face or another council body might face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| Preferably the best meeting is one where I don't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| But eventually my time comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| As Council and the Administration may recall, a couple of months ago this matter was postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| to allow the law department and myself to review this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| I've taken a considerable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| I've reviewed the Tennessee cases concerning conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| But to the best of my research, there's not a Tennessee Supreme Court case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| that settles this matter for once and for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| I do have less of a concern with conditions, for example, that, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4797)|
| 1:20:05| add landscaping, add screening than I do with a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| and my concern may be right, it may be wrong, it's not settled yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| that remove uses that are already permitted in a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4817)|
| 1:20:25| For example, if you have a zone where you have on the book 10 uses that are permitted as of right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4825)|
| 1:20:34| and then you decide to take away a use or two or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| I think that that has not been judicially settled yet within the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4839)|
| 1:20:47| So until that time, it's hard to predict the set of future circumstances that can come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4847)|
| 1:20:55| and what the court may or may not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| But I also need to point out that MPC's own attorney is comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4860)|
| 1:21:07| So, you know, there's some comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| There's a little not the same level of comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| I mean, I wish I could give city council a black and white Tennessee State Supreme Court case on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4876)|
| 1:21:25| but I don't think I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| I mean, I spent a number of hours researching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Another, you know, issue, you know, that was brought up was the letter that I was sent a copy of today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4891)|
| 1:21:40| that you all were sent a copy of from the Bradley's attorney, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| Now, what I did with all members of council before Christmas break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4906)|
| 1:21:52| I called each and every one of you all one at a time and explained, here's what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| Here's what my research came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| And I also said, and which I did, I shared with Mr. Seymour all of my information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| And he, I told him the cases that I reviewed, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| I told members of council that I fully expect Mr. Seymour to say, you're wrong and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| This case doesn't apply to the applicant, and I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| But unfortunately today, you know, I received a letter, like you all did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| that attacked me for the time that I was on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| So, you know, those were votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| I mean, one vote was practically ten years ago when I served on this body, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| But if you look at those votes, some of those things didn't really involve removing permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4961)|
| 1:22:49| It was things, landscaping, screening, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| So, you know, instead of being able to have a reasonable legal disagreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| unfortunately I took it as basically an ad hominem type of attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| But council needs, as they do in all other circumstances, weigh the merits of an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4982)|
| 1:23:12| I know you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| I've talked to you all enough about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| And so that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| You don't ever make flip decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| You all definitely do your jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| I just can't tell you with any certainty what a court may or may not do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5001)|
| 1:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Well, thank you, Rob, if you'll let me finish, Mayor, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| You know, and it's that uncertainty that makes me uncomfortable with allowing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| I mean, again, I like Ms. Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| I think her intentions are good for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| And who knows what will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| It will be, you know, a dancer's studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| She can still lease the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| We're not taking away the use of her building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| She has an office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| She bought the property with an inherent risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| And there's no guarantees what she would be able to do with this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| So here we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| And that's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Well, this is a very unusual piece of property, given its history, given that it was a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| in the R1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| It is a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| And it's been used as an office, and they're granted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| But they're not really granted that without the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| Because they can't use, they can't, it's going to affect their mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| It could affect their, certainly their financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| It affects their signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| And it does affect their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| You know, it's certainly been, I've talked to Mrs. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| I've certainly talked to Mrs. Bradley as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| I've been out to the property, looked at it, studied it, and was very familiar with it from before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| But I think that the use is a good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| We always refer to O1 zoning as the transitional zone from commercial through to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| It's a low-impact use on three acres of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| We're never guaranteed what the future, on any zoning that we'd handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| We've got to decide if this is the highest and best use for the property as it is right now, as it's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| It's built as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| It's an all-brick building built as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| And I think that that's what we're here to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| I would have preferred that, you know, I would have preferred that NPC had looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| especially when you get to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| that this sector plan included the seven properties between this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| and the railroad tracks to be considered for O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| You're not rezoning in O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| You're just giving it the opportunity to in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| And I think it's likely that that will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| I mean, there's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| And that very well may be its highest and best use going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| It doesn't diminish the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| No, this is not a trying to tear down the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| This is a support the neighborhood as much as anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| support the property owner and support with the right zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| I particularly, and generally speaking, I don't believe in giving exceptions to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| I've raised this issue before on another piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| and that's where Mr. Donaldson explained this lowercase k in the brackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5171)|
| 1:26:18| Because if I pull up, my question was a year or so ago, I asked Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| I said, I pull up the zoning map on a piece of property, I see it's zoned O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| How do I know those exclusions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| I'm going to sell the property or I'm going to do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| How do I know what's the permanent record for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| And that's when he told me that it was the k.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| And I generally don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| I think that it's limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| And these uses, as it's been discussed, these uses that they're worried about are used on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| So it comes back before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| And it's certainly appealable here, again, if those uses are inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| So there's mechanisms in place to address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| So I guess my question to Mr. Frost is, is it permissible to make the motion to approve this without those exceptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5221)|
| 1:27:12| If there's concerns about those exceptions and voting it in and we'd rather not have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| is it appropriate to make a motion and vote on it without the exceptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| Councilman Wallace, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| I did review the transcript of the matter, the initial application put forth by the Bradleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5248)|
| 1:27:38| and I conferred with Mike Brousseau, the MPC planner tasked with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| and I'm of the opinion that it would be a one of many proper motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5264)|
| 1:27:52| This could be a proper motion to be made to pass it as office with no conditions attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5272)|
| 1:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| And, you know, so it's before us with those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| And, you know, if that pleases more people to have those conditions on there, I can support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| But, I mean, I think the highest and best on these things is to support zoning as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| And I'm in more in favor of voting on it without those exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| I've heard tonight the statement that the zoning will always go with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| and it seems that we pull that out of the air when it's convenient, and if it's not convenient, we don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| Every ordinance that we pass, every zoning that we do in 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 years, another council can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5323)|
| 1:28:54| So I think that when we look at these things, we need to look what is right for the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| and we would like that to go with it forever, but we know that the next council may have very different ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| I'm going to be supporting this, and, in fact, I'd like to make a motion that we approve this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| I think that it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| I do not think that it's going to negatively impact the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| I think that neighborhood is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| I think a transitional zone is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| I've also looked at this property and the uses of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| I remember in 2012 when Family Promise was looking at the property, there was a huge, huge outcry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5370)|
| 1:29:39| But we do have the support of most of the NSKIPP neighborhood group, and it is closest to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5379)|
| 1:29:47| It's farthest from Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| So I would be moving that we support this for the reasons I've stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5389)|
| 1:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Councilman Dela Lope and then Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Well, it seems to me that what we're being asked to do is approve office light, something that's not O1, that's something that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5403)|
| 1:30:14| This body has the authority as the legislature to create an office light, an O1A or an O1B or some different zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5414)|
| 1:30:24| but that's not what's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| They have come here through MPC with an Office 1 that has stated legally of right uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5426)|
| 1:30:35| and they attempt to clean up the potential mess because there were a number of people on MPC who were concerned that some uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5435)|
| 1:30:44| whether it's the Kitty Cat Club or the halfway house or an apartment, that they didn't think was desirable in this R1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5444)|
| 1:30:52| And it seems to me that this whole area just recently went through a sector plan and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| This was not brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| It was not discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| If we want to create an Office 1 light, we should do that first and then consider this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| But what we've been asked to do is to add conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| Now, George would waive the conditions, but the conditions, if you read the case law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| and I know you probably haven't had a chance to do that or don't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| it deals with MPC and this body's power to put peripheral conditions on land use to mitigate harm to surrounding users and owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5479)|
| 1:31:30| And so maybe you limit the entrance only from the main road or not from the side road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| Maybe you make a setback deeper than you otherwise would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| Maybe you put shrubs that screen some activity that might be noisy or not aesthetically pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5498)|
| 1:31:45| Those are fair limitations on the actual use, but it doesn't take away the right that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5505)|
| 1:31:52| And I'm surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| I don't care if there's a Supreme Court decision or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I'm surprised that we would entertain a request to adopt just a part of O1 and then try to defend it later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5516)|
| 1:32:04| because this does go with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| And, Brenda, if it gets Office 1 and you want to put it back to R1 and the owner doesn't agree, you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| You can't do it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| You can't do it against their will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| They have a grandfathered right under TCA 13-7-208 to use their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| And Ms. Malone stood here and told you the city, or if you read the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| the city has already acted and stated that this property is grandfathered as office in light of the 1985 use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5548)|
| 1:32:36| So she gets to use this as an office and to sell it or parts of it as an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| except for the back part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| I mean, she's not hindered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| She bought this at a great price, apparently half price, because of the zoning restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| She's a realtor and she knows how to flip it with a better zoning on it and make more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| And that's great if you can do it, but this zone has pieces in it that are destructive to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| that are out of sync with the residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| I think we should deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| If we want to take up Office 1 light, let's adopt that and let her apply for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| That's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| I had a question concerning the history of the use of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| I just wanted to be clear, and I guess I'll just ask Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| After it was no longer a church for the Bradleys, the Nakes people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| and I've been over there and looked at the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| but during that time was there anything else in it when it wasn't used as a church until the Bradleys had it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5608)|
| 1:33:37| Yes, it's been used as offices for the Presbyterian Church of East Tennessee since 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5617)|
| 1:33:47| It's been used for offices since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| It was vacant for two years prior to Ms. Bradley purchasing the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5630)|
| 1:33:58| but the Presbyterian had gotten building permits from the city of Knoxville to use it as office space for the Presbyterian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5638)|
| 1:34:09| It was used as church offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Yes, Presbyterian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| It has not been used as a church and not consecrated to worship since the early 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| Okay, so the only thing that has been there is a church office and then the Bradleys came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5661)|
| 1:34:28| but nothing else has been there is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| I just wanted to be clear on the history of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| This has been used as an office space on that site for several years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| and that has really been a nonconforming use of that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| It's my understanding that Ms. Bradley wants to get the property conforming to how it is used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| and I think that that is an important issue for us to address here and consider in approving her request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5695)|
| 1:35:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| I'll go back to some of Dale Vopey's comments about her right to use the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5705)|
| 1:35:13| Let's go to Dan Kelly and ask him, can she have a bill to sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5713)|
| 1:35:20| and use the signage as she could in an O1 zoning as it is right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| No, that would not be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| The sign regulations and residential zone are very restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| So, Mr. Valevobey, back to your comment that she can't use the property as she's been grandfathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| as she's been permitted, and you're wrong about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| So, you know, the fact is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| She can go to the BZA and get that changed if she needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| Well, you can't, and that's what we're here for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| and that's what she's trying to get, the conforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| and trying to make a conforming use for her use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| My guess is, is Ms. Bradley, to have a real estate office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| the Tennessee Real Estate Commission requires that a letter come from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| that says that you have the proper zoning for a real estate office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| A real estate office is not permitted in R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| Would she get a letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| Would you authorize a letter that says she has a proper zoning for that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| I don't believe we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| So, she could not use it for a real estate office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| because the Tennessee Real Estate Commission has to have a letter from the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| that says she has authorized...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| Says she's using it as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| She can't use it as her formal real estate office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Or, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| You ask me, Ms. Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| The city of Knoxville gave me a temporary letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| The city law department is who asked me to come and rezone this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| So, it's a temporary letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| I think that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| And that's the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| You're denying her that she's been granted under this grandfather use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| So, it is very unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| In my short time on council, we've not seen a property that was used as a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| in an R1 zoning, you know, and to be challenged in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| It's a very unusual case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| Councilman Steyer and then Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| This was a tough, tough issue for a lot of the issues that have already been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| I think first, just looking at it with just ignoring the condition issue, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| to me it makes sense that O1 would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| I think things have changed on Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| It is a unique property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| It's not a single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| If it burned down, would someone be able to build single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| with access on Cedar Lane and sell them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| I think that would be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| So, then you're looking at multifamily, which there's a good deal in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5860)|
| 1:37:48| The sense I get is the Neighborhood Thanks office will help stabilize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| and stem some of the multifamily growth there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| You know, that's sort of my take on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| Again, it's a tough, tough issue, and I think there's good arguments on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| But that's looking at just as a plan O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| In terms of the conditions, I do not have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| I didn't look at the case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| But I do know that the attorney for MPC, Steve Wise, who's been doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5895)|
| 1:38:22| I think that's been dealing with these types of issues for a long time, feels one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| Our attorney feels another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| Just as an attorney, that means there's probably a good argument there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| and a good legal battle is not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| So that may be sufficient enough to stop any potential investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5917)|
| 1:38:44| from trying to do the different things that are conditioned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| So I'd be a little bit more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| I think the neighborhood was more comfortable with the conditions in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| Given the mixed opinion, I'd feel a little more comfortable with the conditions being left in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Ms. Bradley, you agree with the conditions that have been placed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| Do you plan for any expansion of this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| What about parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| Do you have enough parking there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| There's nobody using the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| We're in and out sporadically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| You need to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Yes, please speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| First of all, yeah, do you agree to the conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Everybody that uses the building is in and out sporadically, so there's never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| I don't think we've ever had more than four cars there at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| We're all sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| And then I'd like for Mr. Swanson, can you throw a little light on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| Of course not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Never heard you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| I can give you one more lawyer's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| Oh, let's have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Essentially what I would say is that I have, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| researched the case law with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| And there's some case law out there from the Court of Appeals that would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| that you can do conditional zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| but it doesn't really talk about what conditional zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| It's also not a Tennessee Supreme Court case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| and it doesn't really reference any cases upon which it bases that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| So there is case law out there that suggests some approval of conditional zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6019)|
| 1:40:29| but it's not analytical and it's not an opinion of the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| So my final answer on that question from the state of Tennessee is we don't have a definitive opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6034)|
| 1:40:41| from the Tennessee Supreme Court as to whether or not conditional zoning would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| Because we didn't have that, I actually researched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| I didn't research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| I had lawyers who know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| Researched from other states the issue with respect to conditional zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| and found a number of cases from other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| and they're not precedential here in Tennessee at all, but they may be persuasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| And the case that was most on point was a case from Maryland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| and the case from Maryland divided it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| Just like your attorney mentioned a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| it said that conditional zoning is okay in terms of structural issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| things like buffer zones, things like how many stories you can have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| things like things on the property itself that will provide some buffer to prevent harm to adjacent neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| But it said eliminating uses from a permitted use is not something that is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| They called that conditional use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| And that was not permitted in Maryland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| So I can tell you what the answer to this question is in Maryland if you care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| But I can't tell you what the answer to this is really in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| because we don't have a really close opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| So we might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| So that's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| And one other thing that I would like to say is no matter what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| I know that we have done conditional zoning in the past, and I don't think I've ever had to defend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| I don't think we've ever had a lawsuit about the fact that we've done conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| I can remember telling counsel when I was in Mr. Frost's position that I don't know what the answer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6141)|
| 1:42:29| and there is a little risk to doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| But that risk has been there for many years now, and it's never come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| So we still don't know what the answer to the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| Finally, I would like to say that in this particular case, you know when MPC adopted this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| they adopted four conditions to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| And we've had some talk about whether you want to retain those conditions or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| In my view, you need to decide that question, whether you're going to retain the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| If you're going to do this, you need to decide whether you're going to retain the conditions or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| And we need the record to be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| And frankly, I think the record needs to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| Even if you're going to keep the conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| the ordinance as it is presented to you tonight doesn't say subject to four conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| So if that's what you want to do, if you want to leave those conditions in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| I think it needs to be amended to say subject to four conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| and I can tell the city recorder where they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| And the caption and two other clauses in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| That would come up in second reading then, the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| Yeah, well, you could do that on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| That might kick it back to the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| You need to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| When you vote, make the record clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| Amend it to say to include the four conditions, to include three of the four conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| to include none of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Whatever you're going to do, amend it to say specifically what you're doing with respect to those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| until at least the record is clear whether it's defensible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| And then, Mayor, if I can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| And I'd like to ask MPC, there was some question brought up in terms of whether or not this is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| Would you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| We certainly wouldn't object to the idea that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| I'm Dan Kelly with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| We would object to the idea that it is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| You know, part of the reason we say that is that's why we're going through these plan amendment processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| The sector plan, the one-year plan, these items are coming before you in order to avoid being spot zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6262)|
| 1:44:31| because if you're rezoning property in compliance with approved plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6271)|
| 1:44:38| at that point you have skirted a lot of the argument as to whether or not this is spot zoning or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| If you were to appear before this body and say rezone it and it be contrary to the existing plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6284)|
| 1:44:52| then there may be an argument for spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| But in this particular case with the adoption of the plan amendments, I think that argument has been settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6295)|
| 1:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| Well, and then the other thing I just want to say is that sometimes, and this I'm saying to Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6305)|
| 1:45:11| Mark, sometimes it's difficult to, you know, represent a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| and have your fellow colleagues not go along with you as happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| But I think that, you know, with the neighborhood behind this and with what we've heard so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| I think it's one thing that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| I don't know if you have any further comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| Well, I mean, let's talk about the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| I mean, we're talking about a young budding neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| that prides less than 10 or 15 people that attend regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| So we're not talking about a whole lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| I love Betty Jo and all the work she's doing to help get it going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| but we're not talking about a vast number of people that are in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| You know, this needs to go before public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| We're going to do a big plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| We're not having any public meetings except this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| so we're making that decision now instead of annually or how often we like to do these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| Anyway, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| I appreciate your concern, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| I still feel like we're potentially allowing something that will have negative impacts in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6370)|
| 1:46:19| Do you think there needs to be further study on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| I mean, I would like to see if fellow council would like to see a small plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| or a small area plan amendment or something that we can look at other properties beside this one specific property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| That would probably be more prudent than just allowing this one particular property in parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| I mean, we're talking about potentially doing pocket developments or courtyard-style developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| This property would be great for something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| It doesn't have to be a huge apartment complex or whatever you could cram into the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| So I think there are options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| We're not diminishing the value for Miss Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| We would only be increasing the value probably by rezoning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| We all like to make money, but I think we've got a community to consider here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6420)|
| 1:47:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Council, it looks like it's the end of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| We actually are dealing with three different ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| The first is the amendment to the North City Sector Plan, then the one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| and then the actual rezoning where, if there were conditions, they would be added at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| Currently, we have a motion to approve the amendment to the North City Sector Plan by Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| Repeat that again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| All of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| We've got three ordinances, 12C, D, and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| And the first, 12C, is an amendment to the North City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| If that is approved, then we move on to the one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| If that's approved, then we move on to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| If the first does not pass, then the other two are moved at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| So if there are conditions that would be attached, then that is done on the third ordinance, just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6476)|
| 1:48:04| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| So we have a motion and a second to approve the amendment to the North City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Let's do a roll call on this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6503)|

| 1:48:26| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6506)|

| 1:48:28| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Vice Mayor Pablis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6512)|

| 1:48:36| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| So this is approved 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| So we go on now to the ordinance to, oh, I'm sorry, you have to read it formally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| That's not to the third one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| 12-D is an ordinance approving the request of Cindy Bradley for a one-year plan amendment from low-density residential to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| for the southeast portion of the property described as being located on the southwest side of Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| northeast of Rowan Road, Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| Just roll call again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6557)|

| 1:49:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| 5-4 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| So now we move on to 12-E, which is the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| 12-E is an ordinance to rezone the southwestern portion of the property located on the northwest side of Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6578)|
| 1:49:43| northeast of Rowan Road, from R1 to 01, Cindy Bradley, Applicant, Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Does this have the conditions in it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Can I make a motion to send this back to MPC at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| The law director says yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| For what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Yeah, for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| For what purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| You ought to tell them why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| Why now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| I wanted to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| Does MPC get to decide whether they want it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| No, I think in the conversation like that I was having with Mark, that it seems like that possibly what we need to do is to look at those seven properties going down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6616)|
| 1:50:25| and that what I'd like to do is to send it back and have MPC look at that particular area through there in terms of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6625)|
| 1:50:36| So that's a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| That's a motion to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| I'm a little concerned about sending it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| They weighed in on this once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| The additional properties between this and the railroad track or whatever, those could come at a separate time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6649)|
| 1:50:56| but I don't think we need to be looking at sending this back and then come back up here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6656)|
| 1:51:03| I mean, we've had this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| Well, my thought is part of what Mark is saying, that I'm not opposed to this particular property being 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6667)|
| 1:51:15| I have a problem with a piece of property being 01 in the center of the R1 area when we know that there's a number of situations between the Bradley property and the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6675)|
| 1:51:26| For instance, I know Cindy and I had a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| There's some offices already there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| And so it seems to me that instead of just – I feel like what we're doing is we're spotting out one piece of property within this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6691)|
| 1:51:40| when there's a whole – there's seven other properties along Cedar Bluff that really need to be looked at that possibly what needs to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| is that all of that area through there needs to be 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| And I think that that ought to be looked into and brought back to us to say whether or not it should or shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6710)|
| 1:51:56| And I'd like to see MPC take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| In fact, frankly, I really thought that's what they were going to be doing the last time we talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| I'll make this a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Okay. We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Well, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| That's what I suggested last time when we delayed it a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| And there was no discussion about it at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| And I said it again tonight, I think, in an ideal world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| I mean, I ask Ms. Bradley, would it be a hardship on you to postpone this for at least another 60, 90 days while it goes back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6743)|
| 1:52:30| This application has been in since June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| It's a huge hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| I have tenants there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| The city removed all of our signs on New Year's Eve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| And the tenants are going to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| While I appreciate the consideration for the other properties, Mr. Grieve, you know, this is a very unique property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6761)|
| 1:52:48| I served on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| I understand the difficulty you're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| But by the same token, when there are very unique properties, that's why you're here to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| And no other municipality in the state does an elected body get to make decisions from a zoning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6777)|
| 1:53:05| And that's by choice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| But this is a unique property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| This is one of those votes that, you know, it's a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| But it is a huge detriment to me to have this delayed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| And for that reason, I can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| I mean, I think in an ideal world, yeah, but we've already postponed it and we've said on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| But it doesn't preclude the planning commission from looking at those other properties, you know, in the future and considering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6806)|
| 1:53:36| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| I withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| You're going to withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| Okay, that's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| We're back to the motion to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| I'll move that it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| Please speak into your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| I'd move that 12E be approved with the four conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| You moved in the ordinance to include the four conditions that were adopted by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Has it been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Well, it really didn't get drafted in that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| And so, really, it would be an amendment to what is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| Has someone moved and seconded already for 12E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| I guess I'll move for 12E to approve 12E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| So we have a motion and a second for 12E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| I would move to amend the ordinance to add the four conditions contained in the agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| Is that sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| Is there any discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| So we're voting on the amendment first, which is the four conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Okay, and so now we go back to the original motion to rezone as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6905)|

| 1:55:11| So it passes 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=6914)|

| 1:57:34| word way since you had a uniform street system that required this to be called a road or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7054)|
| 1:57:42| a street as I understood it if it was north-south as opposed to east-west and that ways were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7062)|
| 1:57:49| sort of a deviation along private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| That's how I read the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| I understand that it's a lot of pizzazz to call it Joan Cronin Way, but I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| about keeping uniform sort of criteria on how we name streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| Could you address that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| Dan Kelly with MPC again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| The street naming guidelines would suggest that this should be Joan Cronin Road or Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7091)|
| 1:58:21| and the Planning Commission, though, since the word guidelines are in there, they chose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| to accept the name of the street as applied for, which was Joan Cronin Way, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7107)|
| 1:58:34| their recommendation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7114)|

| 1:59:02| No, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| This is, I know we've had a long night, but I had some serious concerns on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7146)|
| 1:59:14| M?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7154)|

| 1:59:19| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| We're on L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| This is the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| And South and North Shore Drive rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| I guess, you know, my first concern is it looks like this individual had been selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7166)|
| 1:59:33| cars, you know, violating the zoning code to begin with, and that always raises a red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| And I had concerns regarding C4 at this location, and C4 is highway and arterial, and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7180)|
| 1:59:49| didn't think that was appropriate for this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| And then talked to MPC and Mr. Hagerman, and it's also in the F1, which complicates things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7191)|
| 2:00:01| quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| I learned a lot more than I woke up with about F1 zoning and FEMA regulations, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7203)|
| 2:00:14| we should consider postponing this matter to better understand F1 and what can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7214)|
| 2:00:25| in this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7225)|
| 2:00:30| And Mr. Hagerman, could you explain to Council a little bit about what we discussed and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| challenges with this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Well, the big challenge with the property is that it is zoned F1, which means that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7239)|
| 2:00:46| basically can't build any kind of structure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| So if there is any economic use to be gained from that piece of property, it has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7249)|
| 2:00:58| from display of stuff to sell, including cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7258)|
| 2:01:05| And that's under base zoning, I believe that's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7265)|
| 2:01:12| So in order for anything to be done there commercially, it has to be, the zone has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7272)|
| 2:01:22| be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| So that's sort of where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| There is no way to build anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| Everything that's built in that area is grandfathered into the floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| And Mr. Kelly, can you explain why the MPC staff recommended that it be denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7296)|
| 2:01:44| Well, looking initially at it, the idea of, the way the process has worked in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7304)|
| 2:01:56| is the property adjoining in this particular case was zone C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7316)|
| 2:02:03| The building official's office has interpreted for years since the adjoining property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7323)|
| 2:02:10| zone C3 that they would permit C3 type uses on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| So the issue then became, do you want to have open sales on the property or continue with the C3 uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7335)|
| 2:02:25| Well, after the staff decided that the C3 uses would probably be the most appropriate use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7345)|
| 2:02:33| because they are generally determined to be of less impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| the C4 zone that the planning commission, C4 slash F1 zone that the planning commission placed on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7359)|
| 2:02:47| after hearing the arguments regarding the F1 and what could and could not occur with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| actual building construction in the F1, they decided the C4 was the better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| That way it would limit the uses basically to the open type uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| A used car lot, if you have a flooding event, those vehicles could be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| and would not impede the flow of floodwaters, whereas if a building were in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| there's all kinds of, even if a building could be placed on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7396)|
| 2:03:22| there would be all kinds of issues with regard to the rise in flood levels and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| So the planning commission took a reasoned approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| and decided that the C4 was probably the best alternative for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| Thank you. It's an extremely complex piece of property given the flood zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7417)|
| 2:03:45| but I think it's something we should take carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| This is on North Shore Drive to the highway to the Veterans Cemetery as well as Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7428)|
| 2:03:55| the new cathedral being built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| I just don't feel comfortable with the used car lot at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| I think it makes sense, and I'd make a motion to postpone it for two meetings, I guess 28 days, to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7444)|
| 2:04:16| Do I have a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| There is a second. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| Sir, are you the applicant? I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| Counsel, if you'd like, allow him to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| All I wanted to say is that I'd like to have Mr. Green have an opportunity to speak to counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| in terms of why he's doing what he's doing and how long he's been there for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7470)|
| 2:04:36| If you could go ahead and address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| Jerry Green, 1706 Maple Green Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| I started down there in 1995, which was just 302 South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| As our business grown, I bought 300 South North Shore Drive, which is right beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| Then I came back and bought 302 North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| What was beside me, I'm already C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| 300 and 302 is already C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| It's been C4 for nine years when I went before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| My business has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| I'm not doing anything any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| What I did was when I got 204 North Shore, that had been a piece of property that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| if you drove by there for the past few years, it was a little bit just out of shape, you might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| But I cleaned it completely up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| Then I went to the codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| When I first was told by the city and county, hey, you're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| State, call the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| You're just moving your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| You're expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| You can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| But as I went to get a demo permit for an old house that was out in front, then I got involved with codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7535)|
| 2:05:42| They said, hey, that property is not zoned correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| I understand you're zone 300, 302, C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| And that's really how I got here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| But 204, I went through the whole process of bringing it all into code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7550)|
| 2:05:56| through all the fire, electrical, plumbing, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| I put 204 back into compliance with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| And this whole property down through there, if anybody's drove down through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| it's been a problem for a few years, I mean for probably a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| because for years it was just basically businesses that never did go before codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7570)|
| 2:06:15| and see exactly what could and could not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| But nobody ever said anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| So when I did that, I went through codes, got everything up to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| cleaned that whole lot up and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| But on the C4, my 300, 302, I'm already C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| I've been that way for nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| I'm not doing anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| Just by making it C4 or giving you C4, it don't override the F1 anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| You can't do anything with it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| All you're basically doing is giving me the opportunity to do what I've always done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| Can I do anything different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| Can I add on to it? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| Can I do this? Can I do that? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| You can't do anything because that F1 overrides it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| There's nothing I can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| To the right of me, for any flood concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| there's a railroad berm that is almost 30 foot high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| There's no way that property, and I've been there 20 years, it don't flood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| It floods on down at where Agnes and the bridge used to get stopped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7628)|
| 2:07:14| But now they've cleaned that out, and we never have had a problem since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| But I'm basically here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| I went before MPC and explained, I guess, like I am right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| But, you know, it was unanimous when I went before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| I'm not trying to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| I'm not trying to, if you've been by there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| I'm not trying to turn something into a used car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| That's not my intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| All it enables me to do, I never had the parking and the space to do what I was needing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7655)|
| 2:07:40| And it was just so crammed when you had 50, 250 foot lots by 175,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7660)|
| 2:07:46| and then you took 5,000 square foot for a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| It was just absolutely crammed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| There was no way that I could do what I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| So when I got 204, it just really opens me up for the next, you know, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7673)|
| 2:07:59| I don't have, you know, it's plenty of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| It's nothing fancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| It's a building that's up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| It's a shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| It's a 5,000 square foot building to work on cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| It's nothing more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| But we've got so much room that when you got the license in to buy automobiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| I do sell some cars out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| I've always sold cars out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| I mean, I've done that for nine years and really did it before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| And MPC helped me get my C4s on, and then to be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| I've always tried to be in compliance and be, you know, within the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| And I haven't had one bit of opposition to anything I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| My neighbors, you know, the person that would be to my left is me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| The one that's to the right of me is a railroad track, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| So there's not anybody down there that's up here with any type of opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| You know, I know it's a little, I guess, how the flood zones and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| it's a little complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| Thank God it's not a church and going the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| But, you know, I'm just trying to basically put it into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| And I think codes and everybody else, it's one piece of property they can put a big X on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| And, you know, they don't have to worry about that when it's up to compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| You know, when everything's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| And that's, you know, that's always been my whole goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| Mr. Green, I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| One of the things that we don't have in our document that shows that your property is C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| Is it C-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| This property is actually not Zone C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| He did come through the Planning Commission some years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| through what was called a special use determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| And, again, following the city's practice of the building officials' practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7774)|
| 2:09:41| of allowing the uses on the F-1 property of the property across the street is Zone C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7781)|
| 2:09:52| So, therefore, he was allowed to have C-4 uses on his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7792)|
| 2:09:59| which entitled him to get a dealer's license and sell cars from that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| It is not Zone C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| It is Zone C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| I just want to make sure that's clear because that doesn't show up on our document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| It says it's C-4, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| Unless I'm wrong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| Across the street doesn't look like it's C-4 to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| I read the map to say C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| The whole point is, and, again, Dan, correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| that all through that floodplain area down through there on that side that no buildings can be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7836)|
| 2:10:43| unless we really bring up the elevation of the soil, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| I would leave that up to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| Wrong person to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| You know, you can't even build a building if you build the elevation up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| Outside of the floodway, it's still floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| The F-1 is basically the floodway where you can't build anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| Anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| Outside of that, you still have floodplain and it's regulated floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| and that's where the floor elevation is relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| So you can't even build anything in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| So everything that's there is grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| And I think if any of my colleagues have been down to see his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| and see what he's done to the Quonset hut that was there in terms of what he's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| in terms of meeting all the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| He's had all the city go through that, you know, in that particular area on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| But I just wanted to be sure to have clarification that in terms of what the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| Let me say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| Mr. Green is legitimately selling cars from his current location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| where the transmission shop is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| There was an action by the planning commission that allowed him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| His property is not in C4, but he is legitimately selling cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| And I don't want to leave you with the opinion that he's doing something improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7920)|
| 2:12:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| Because it's on C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| I don't know what I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| Mr. Green, just at this point after you've made your statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| you have to wait for a council member to call upon you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| If he has another comment, I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| Mr. Green, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| It's not really what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| I went and got nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| That's all I'm asking to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7946)|
| 2:12:27| It's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| You know, I'm legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| That's all I ever wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| So that's really why I'm here today, just to be legal and everybody's in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| Councilman Wallace and then Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| Yeah, I guess my question would be back to Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| Would he be allowed to add any non-pervious surface?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7966)|
| 2:12:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| Because it's gravel now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| So it's gravel now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| So would he be able to pave it with a non-pervious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| Parking of whatever surface is allowed, as I understand it, in the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| and by FEMA regulations, the main thrust here is not to add a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7985)|
| 2:13:14| or fill that would resist the flow of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| which would cause the flood elevation to rise on the adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| So I guess back to Mr. Steyer's comment, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| would you be willing to study over the next few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| and look at a landscape plan and submit a landscape plan as part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| you know, in the screening or a little bit of screening from the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| I don't think there's really a purpose for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| because everything you've got all the way to there is no landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| There's no landscaping if you go down South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| If you go, you can turn straight off South North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| and into Harper's Schwinn, or I think it's Harper's Bison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| to into the pub, anywhere down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| Would I mind to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8040)|
| 2:14:01| But I'm really, my big concern is I want to get legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| You know, and that's the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| But if you go down either side of that road, there is no landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| All the way from Frank's Barbershop, you turn right off North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| and into the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| There's ham and goodies, I mean, all the way down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| There's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| But I can tell you this, that there will be some beautiful landscaping put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| You know, the only thing that's got me put on hold is just being sure I'm getting in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| That's kind of what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| So in C3, he can sell cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| You're saying it's zone C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| You're reading the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| I'm reading the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| It's zone C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| Again, he went through what was called a special use determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| because the property across the street from the existing transmission shop is zone C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| And based on the interpretation of how to treat that, he was allowed to do the special use determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8090)|
| 2:14:57| And he did that, and he's selling cars legitimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8097)|
| 2:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| I think you just answered the question I had when Councilman Wallace asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| But if it is a postponement and it's studied, is that going to be a hardship for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| I think you just said you were willing for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| I'm willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| You know, it's just, you know, I would be grateful to you if we could close it out tonight and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| But if it's a concern to you, I understand that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| Councilman Dayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| I guess this is just to plead the motion to postpone it for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8137)|
| 2:15:42| We've got a situation where the applicant said his property was zoned for nine years, C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| and the NPC representative says it was not zoned, C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| We've got zoning happening based on what's the other side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| We've got a flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| I mean, this is a complex, confusing matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| And, you know, I think it makes sense to not deny it, not to approve it, just postpone it for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8161)|
| 2:16:09| We can all take a look at all these different rules that apply to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| and figure out really what's best for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| I'm going to totally disagree with my colleague to my right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| First of all, this gentleman has gone through everything that's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8182)|
| 2:16:29| And he found out what he needed to do, and he's done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| We know it's a flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| He also has complied with all the wishes of NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| It went through NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| Not a single person showed up at NPC that was against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| I have received no telephone calls whatsoever in this district about this until two hours before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8206)|
| 2:16:54| And I think in all fairness, I think that by postponing it 30 days, what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| We're going to come back, and we're going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| You know, here's an individual who's been in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| He's got a thriving business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| He's hired additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| He's taken a piece of property that was a landscape company for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8229)|
| 2:17:15| I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| It was a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| And he's really cleaned it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| He's added it to his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| He doesn't have big signs out there saying Jerry's cars for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| or he doesn't have these waving people and balloons and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| And, in fact, he's assured me, he knows how I feel about signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| but he's assured me that he wants to continue the business that he has, which has grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| because basically what he needs, he needs an area to, and maybe this is not the proper terminology, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8262)|
| 2:17:48| but you need a place to store the cars that you go and buy and repair and fix up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| He's been in business there for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| and I think that he's jumped through all the hoops that we've required him to as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| and I think that we should go ahead and allow this individual to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| because he's come back to us and asked to be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| And the only reason, part of the reason that he's here is because someone called and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| hey, by the way, there's a used car lot down on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| Would you look into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| And I called the city and said, would you go look into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| And then that's when he found out that he needed to go ahead and be legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8301)|
| 2:18:24| and he's done everything he can in order to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| So I'm opposed to postponing this 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| Let's vote on it and let this man get back to business and not have to worry with us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| And remember, he is not a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| He may wish it was a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| So right now we have a motion to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| We have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| So let's do a roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| No to the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| I mean no to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| No to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| Just no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8351)|

| 2:19:15| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8357)|

| 2:19:19| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8364)|
| 2:19:25| So it fails six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| So is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8371)|

| 2:19:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| We had a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150107?start=8374)|
