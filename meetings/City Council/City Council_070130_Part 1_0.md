| 0:04:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| First of all, let me find it all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| I want to move to postpone 10A and its companion item, 11P, for two more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=289)|
| 0:05:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=302)|

| 0:05:04| That item number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| 10A and 11P as in Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| These are the South Haven Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| And was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| There was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=315)|

| 0:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| By the way, when we actually get to voting on this or whatever, I want to clarify the record that it wasn't an application by the South Haven Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=319)|
| 0:05:29| But I just brought that up because the mayor mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| But we'll get into that when it actually comes before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| There was 10A and 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| I want to make sure I got P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=340)|

| 0:05:44| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| And was there another one, Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| We have some items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| I don't know if this is the proper time to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| On the consent agenda, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| And don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| I'm not going to bring up the pension for Victor Ashe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| That's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| Is it the one for Jack Barnes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| No, it's 11HH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| I want to take it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| I think we may need to postpone that just until we can clarify how that fits into the South Waterfront plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| You want to take it off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| I want to take it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| And I think at the same time I can probably make a motion to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| So just when you ask for it, it actually comes off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| It's off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| Now I want to make a motion to postpone for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=414)|

| 0:06:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=418)|

| 0:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=420)|

| 0:07:24| And maybe to ask Mr. Swanson to give us a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| I know there are several folks here for that one tonight, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Members of counsel, as you know, we recently tried a case in the circuit court before Judge Rosenbaum having to do with Westmoreland Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=453)|
| 0:07:49| But one of the issues raised in that case was the constitutionality of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| Let me get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| The constitutionality of the statute, which is TCA section 13-3-404B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=484)|
| 0:08:13| And 13-3-404B is the authority that is given to counsel by the state legislature to deal with issues having to do with subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=493)|
| 0:08:29| The appeal of issues related to subdivision regulations comes to city council when they are appropriately appealed by virtue of the authority granted under that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=509)|
| 0:08:43| And essentially what Judge Rosenbaum did in that case was decide that section 13-3-404B was an unconstitutional statute because it applies essentially only to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=523)|
| 0:09:01| We are in the process of determining at this point where we go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| But I think it would be inappropriate at this time to have persons in neighborhood organizations believing that they have a right of appeal that they may not necessarily have under an unconstitutional statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=547)|
| 0:09:23| And, you know, if I was someone in that situation, and 11-Q comes under that situation, it is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| It's an appeal that arises out of approval of a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| And our authority to hear that appeal comes through section 13-3-404B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| And I would suggest to you that we ought to, until we are determined how we are going to deal with this decision from Judge Rosenbaum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=582)|
| 0:09:54| that we ought to give some thought to how we're going to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| And that's why I would suggest to you that it would be a good thing to do to postpone that decision at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| In the meanwhile, if I were in the Norwood Homeowners Association's situation, and this is a very, very unusual situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=605)|
| 0:10:17| they might want to consider whether or not they want to go ahead and file a writ of certiorari in the court in order to preserve their rights of appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=617)|
| 0:10:27| because under Judge Rosenbaum's opinion, that's the only place they have a right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=627)|
| 0:10:36| There are two folks signed up to speak for and against Mr. Redman and Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| Mr. King, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Members of the Council, Mr. Mayor, I'm John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| I'm here on behalf of the applicant for this particular plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| And I hear what Mr. Swanson says, and I don't argue with his interest in being cautious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| making sure he knows where he is on the judge's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| But I'm simply going to want to make an observation, and then if this matter is postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| we'll have opportunity to have further discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| My preference, I guess, would be if it's going to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| You know, certainly no more than four weeks because there are other issues involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| I would remind Council members, and I will discuss with Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| two things occur here in this process that you currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| You have two things occurring at MPC and two things then depending on what happens thereafter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=705)|
| 0:11:53| two different tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| What happens is you have action on a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| and separately you have an application for a use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| and a review of a use-on-review under standards promulgated by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| Currently, appeals of uses-on-review come to City Council not by way of the provisions of 13.3.404b.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=732)|
| 0:12:24| That particular statute, if you read it, I believe plainly discusses a purported basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| for giving this body appellate authority over approval or non-approval of class plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| A use-on-review is a separate sort of a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| I do not believe, if we could sit and discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| I do not believe that Judge Rosenbaum's decision could be taken quite so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| as to say that this body doesn't have authority to hear appeals on uses-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| even though in this particular case that may be to my advantage if that's your ultimate conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| But I just want to call attention to the different things that occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| As far as the request, the suggestion for postponement, I really don't have an objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| Mr. Redman, did you have anything you wanted to add, just to keep things even?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| Very quickly, we agree with Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| If you notice, the two things that were approved at MPC, we only appealed one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| We didn't appeal the part of it that dealt with the subdivision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| So I agree with your counsel, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| An abundance of caution right now is probably a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| The motion was to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Is that right, Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Everybody, there was a second I think I heard over here somewhere, wasn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Everybody in favor of postponing 10B and 11Q, signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Anything else, other items for the agenda before we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| Have we moved the consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| We haven't gotten there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| That's our next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| I'd like to move consent items 11R through 11EE minus double H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| 11II minus double H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| 11II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Okay, we got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| Okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| A few quick items for Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Chief Key, Ms. Pelow prayed for one of our firefighters who was injured this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| Do you want to give us a quick update on him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| As Ms. Pelow said, James is at Vanderbilt in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| I spoke with his wife this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| I'm pleased to report that he is being moved out of intensive care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| Tomorrow will be the first of many surgeries to come that he will have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| I would ask everybody to keep him in your thoughts and prayers, he and his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| A few other quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Can I just, after I said amen, I thought we have another young man who was injured in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| His name is Blaise, and if you would just comment on his condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| and let him know that he's in our thoughts and prayers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Firefighter Gary Ellis was also injured in that fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| He has some facial burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| He is resting at home, and he will be treated on an outpatient basis here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Two or three just meetings so everybody will know about tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| There's actually two separate meetings that might be of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| The Neighborhood Task Force has been working under the leadership of Lyons and Woodhull and Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| and several others, and Ms. Pelos helped on that, several others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| is going to present their conclusions tomorrow at 4.30 at the L.T. Ross Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| Following that, at 5.30, the South Waterfront Oversight Committee is meeting at 5.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| here behind us in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| And then I think everybody on council knows, but for everybody else's information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Arts and Crafts Center at 1127 Broadway on February the 6th at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=979)|
| 0:16:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| I just wanted to bring up, you all probably remember as well as I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| the issue with Michaels and their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Well, as everyone is certainly aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| they were temporarily given their liquor permit back by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| And I heard some comments made by the owner in the media after this decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| He said, I certainly respect the decision of council, but I certainly disagree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| and people can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| And then after the decision that was done by the state ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| he indicated that he got less than a fair and full hearing with his council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| I just want to – I don't pretend to talk for other members of council at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| but the ABC basically gave a three-hour hearing to Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| It was one of many on their agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| When Michaels was in front of this body, they were it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| They had the full undivided attention of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| and we gave at least seven hours of fair and thoughtful consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| Michaels got to put on every single witness, every single piece of evidence that they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| So I certainly want to publicly state that I very much disagree that what happened here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| was anything less than a full and fair hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| I certainly respect the work that the police department did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| I certainly feel the pain, or I should say I can't begin to feel the pain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| of the person who lost their life that was inflicted upon the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| One, I just want to say there's been a group of folks who have been meeting for some community discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| sort of trying to build social capital, getting people in the community to talk about issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| not relating to making a solution, but to share ideas, get to know each other, build a society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| They're going to be meeting again next Wednesday, February 7th, 530 at Lawson McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| It's a discussion, I believe, Mr. Woodall, it's again on downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| That's my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| So public's invited to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| The second thing I've got is actually a question for council related to the budget retreat coming up Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| As you know, we've talked after our last budget where we made some decisions late in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| trying to decide things a little earlier, talk about it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| We have set our next dinner meeting, which is two weeks from tonight, to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| And I wanted to see if folks would be willing to add maybe 15 minutes on to the retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| to talk a little bit about how we talk about the budget, what we're trying to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| see if folks are willing to do that, if they're willing to stick around afterwards to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| I think it might help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| If people wanted to let myself or the vice mayor know that, that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| And let me say that's a good suggestion from Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| We know the budget process comes in to play very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| One of the problems is the tight time frame laid out by the charter for good deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| discussion about the budget after the mayor has had his budget addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| It doesn't leave us much time, sometimes less than a month or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| to kind of have it fitted and vetted before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| But also what I wanted to talk about is, I've got Melissa who's going to hand something to some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| Those of you who read the paper, and I think maybe Hayes may have written an article several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| several weeks ago that there are meetings going on and that I'd called for a meeting with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| and some folks from the community with regards to just those things that were happening back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| and the tenor and flavor of how things were going on in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| We've had a couple of meetings along those lines, and I appreciate the mayor for being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| and he had Larry Martin there, and he's had Madam O'Hara subsequently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| And even out of that meeting, we've broken down into smaller discussions with regards to just the empowerment zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| and trying to be more of a, now let's move forward and talk about what's good for the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| what's good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| One of the things that has come out is that I've made some suggestions for Mr. Martin's consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| and for Madam O'Hara's consideration, and they've come out of those discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| and I want to thank those folks that were involved in those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| We've had representatives from the NAACP and black business contractors and racial justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:11| We've had other individuals, concerned citizens, sit there and just kind of discuss, where do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| And we know that one of the things on the agenda tonight is the contract with the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| but I'm thinking of a more broader thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| and this will dovetail into when we actually start talking about the Urban League contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| so you will understand kind of where I am coming from and why I have my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| What I have before you all for you all to take a look at that ultimately council is going to need to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| and vet as it relates to the empowerment zone is really the whole empowerment zone, where do we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| and how do we get accomplished what we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| It's not a formal proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| It really talks about the board structure of the empowerment zone board, whether it's the P&I, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| One of the things I feel very strongly about, and I've been very clear about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| and I don't hesitate to say it again today, I have concerns about inclusiveness of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| and whether or not it's truly representative at this juncture the way it is of the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| One of the things that I propose is that that board should be comprised of two individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| from each of the geographical ZAC areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| It needs to be reconstituted, and if P&I is not willing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| then maybe we need to go forward and try to figure out if we put a new empowerment zone board together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| The whole key and thrust is we must empower the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| We must keep the decision-making with the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| When the empowerment zone was put together, when these monies were given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| the whole bottom line was, hey, we want to make sure we take the voice, hear the voice of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Some of the concerns I have is that as we go forward, if we do not do this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| we may not be listening again to the voice of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| You know, I've met with the Urban League board chairman and the Urban League board director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| and executive director and some of the board members to make sure they heard me loud and clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| with regards to the Urban League contract and with regards to the Urban League and the loan fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| and I think that the city should contract with the Urban League for a lot of services and programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| I'm still not convinced that putting the loan fund under the Urban League umbrella is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| but what I wanted to do because it's come to my attention that there's been a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| about what is being said, what's not being said, what is Mark's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Is he talking about the overthrow of the world as we know it, or is he trying to actually do something positive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| And I think he's trying to do something positive, and there's a lot of folk who are trying to do something positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Ultimately, as I've said to Larry and Madeline, as we have these small group discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| we must now open it up to the larger council, the P&R board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| I thought it's best to kind of put it in writing, at least the basic framework of what I've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| I think there's an opportunity now to expand the Empowerment Zone board, what it's called, P&R,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| whatever it's called, to get more involvement from technical support and from other organizations like TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| the city, the county, TVA, UT, the chamber partnership, and if done appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| we can together in partnership move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| And when we get more specific to the Urban League contract, I can address some of those specific issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| But as it relates to the P&R, the Empowerment Zone board, I wanted you guys to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| because there's a lot of discussion about what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| and understand that against the backdrop of what has been happening in the community here lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| and the whole issue of black-white, and it seems like every time we look up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| there's a black-white issue going on in the community, whether it's involving what happened in the Kessler situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| or even every time I look up, I see something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| But this is not about black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| This is about empowering those folk in the Empowerment Zone for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| making sure that the monies get out there to those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| making sure that their voice is heard on how these things are done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| and making sure that we do this in the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| This is not about a black-or-white issue or east nozzle or south nozzle issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| This is about an Empowerment Zone issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Mark Brown has always been about understanding one thing, that there's more that unites us than divides us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| I don't appreciate sometimes if I get painted another way or a different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| so I wanted to stay on the record as I did to the Urban League board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| and I'll discuss that contract early and what my suggestions are about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| But I wanted to make sure that this council at least saw a very, very brief statement here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| with regards to the Empowerment Zone, the Empowerment Zone board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| what I think our opportunity is and how we can move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| understanding that the city has three options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| and this actually kind of dovetails into one of the three options the city put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| And so I wanted to put this in front of us because ultimately when we deal with the Urban League contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| I'm going to make some recommendations and some suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| and this is part of the underpinning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| So I wanted to pass this out for you to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| and for council members to see it so you can hear from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| and also see in writing what we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| In the same way that the Strong Neighborhoods Task Force is going to be presenting you a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| the Fifth and Broadway did also a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| and part of that report mentioned that we would continue to meet this Thursday at noon at St. John's Lutheran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:12| We're going to have a meeting to discuss what we thought about your response to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| No, we want to continue the work, and we're a working board, working task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| and we understand that it's not just about giving you the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| It's about us working with you to enact the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| So everybody's invited this Thursday at 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1592)|

| 0:31:26| Yeah, I know there was, I made some comments about sort of how unhappy I was with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| and I've had a chance to talk to the developer and I feel like this is something where one of those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| that we make because we sort of have to, we're not happy about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| because of past decisions and I don't want to dwell a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| I know there's engineers here to talk a little bit about what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| I actually want to talk a little bit to get, I guess, Mark Donaldson actually to talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| about what needs to happen now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| This is a place where commercial is encroaching into a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| has unfortunately sort of, you know, not quite ruined Shasta already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| but I think the encroachment is enough there that that's not going to be a neighborhood street 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| But further south there still is a thriving, strong neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| I want to get some ideas here from Mr. Donaldson about how we protect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| and even ideally get some support from council about taking some of those steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| But I don't know first if people have questions about this specific development for the engineer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:38| Ms. Roddy, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| I spoke with a representative of this project today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| and he indicated that someone would come with some photographs of a prototype of a similar land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:50| in another community in our area that might show the efforts to which they are going to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| Do you have that to share with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| I do not have that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| I had it earlier today and misplaced it earlier and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| This will be a Waggles building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| I think you've seen many Waggles throughout town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| I'm David Harbin at 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| I'm the engineer for this project up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| I did have those earlier and that was my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Could you give us a verbal description of what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| If I'm a homeowner on Shasta Drive and I am looking northward across Shasta Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| to the rear of this property that you're asking for the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| could you give us a verbal description of what that might look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Basically, I guess the best example is the one that the Waggles did out in Maryville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| where we were backing up to a residential area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| It had several layers of screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| One was large evergreen trees first and then they had some smaller bushes through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| and it was able to give almost a complete screening to the back of their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| No access will be on to Shasta Drive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| All of the access will be in front towards Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| There won't be any driveways back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| We won't do anything to increase the traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| It will be a complete landscape screen between us and Shasta Drive to protect those neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| My understanding is that you are going to do the same thing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| that you did with that prototype project in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| What is the depth of the landscape screening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| We have probably about 30 feet in there that we can put trees and smaller bushes and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| So there are several layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| There will be several layers, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Okay. That's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Ms. Pelo, and then I'll come to Councilwoman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| I've been grounded from driving because I've had some problems in my back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| so I wasn't able to go out and make a site visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| But I would like for you to explain to me just how that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| is not going to contain your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| So which other pieces of property are involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| There is one to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| There's actually, I believe, three pieces of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| There's two that's fronting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| I don't have my map here in front of me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| There's actually four pieces of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| I've got the survey here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| There are four pieces other than this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Ms. Pelo, my understanding, you know, where the property is divided with the C1 to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| and the C3 to the north is that the store will actually be sitting on that C3 portion of the lot that we're resenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| That had to be my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Because it will sit quite a ways back from Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| And it's going to actually involve the properties both, is that north or south or east or west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| I can't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| But both properties adjacent on Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| I believe it's, I don't know if the lot numbers are on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| It will be lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| The corner lot and the lot, the interior lot on the other side, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| The corner lots, the pizza hut that is next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Oh, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| So it's already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Another establishment there that's already commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| That other one is zoned 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| That's the one to the southwest of us right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| That would be on, what is that, Fennel Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| And on Shasta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| That is an old house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| I don't believe it's used as a residence right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Well, it's zoned 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| It's zoned 01 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| So it's just a small house that's been there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| So it's not been developed yet into an office situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| Basically, it's three lots in this PLO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| It's lot 16, 15, and lot 22 is what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| The actual rezoning, the only thing we're asking for the rezoning is on lot 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| That will make all this lot be identical with the C3 in the front and C1 in the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| So it's the interior lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| You don't front on fennel at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| You know, I agree with Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| It would have been helpful to have some descriptive material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Councilman Holtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Well, when we split a lot like this in zoning, I think it's an awkward thing to do in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| It doesn't strike me as a particularly good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| That's something I'd be interested to hear Mr. Donaldson opine on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| or speak to in terms of splitting lots with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| To me, it's an awkward thing to do, and I'm not sure if it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| And, again, there's no C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| There's only one C1 partially zoned parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| A portion of that parcel is zoned C1 on Shasta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| and nothing else on Shasta is commercially zoned at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| But, Mr. Donaldson, do you care to make any comments on split zoning on a single parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2273)|
| 0:38:03| Well, this request continues a pattern that has been established on Shasta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| on several lots that run from Cedar to Shasta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| They have zoned the Cedar frontage, C3, which is our general commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| and then the Shasta portion of the lot, C1, which is our neighborhood commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| which is less intense in terms of uses and the size of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:36| and that sort of thing that could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| So they've started to establish a transition on those double frontage lots from Cedar to Shasta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2318)|
| 0:38:50| It occurs down near the Leo's Restaurant, I think that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| El Chico's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| El Chico's, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| And then the large lot that Weigel's already owns has that split zoning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:12| There are two large double frontage lots, but the one in question is not a double frontage lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| Not now, but in order to do any development, they'll have to re-subdivide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| Essentially, we're writing off Shasta as a residential street by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| Currently, all of the north side of Shasta is zoned either commercial or office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| and the south side of it is zoned R2, which is our multi-dwelling residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| Most of what is actually on the south side of Shasta currently is actually R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| single-family residential probably, the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Well, it's zoned R2, but mostly there may be a duplex in there somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| but mostly it's single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| There's a lot of places in the city that are zoned R2 that we are now in the process of downzoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| because they've, in fact, been developed as R1-type developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| The majority of the zoning on the north side is a 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| which is intended to be a buffer between commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| For the most part, functionally, that's still what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| There are a couple of exceptions with those double frontage lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| but most of it is still buffered by office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| which, of course, I guess you can use as parking in some cases for other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| But in theory, we've got a buffering going on there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| and we're getting ready to do away with that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| So that's a decision we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| You're right, it's creeping and it's incremental, but it hasn't been fully made yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| and I think we're on the verge of making that perhaps tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| I think, Mr. Olkowicz, you hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| Functionally right now, I think at one level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| I don't know if the buffer looks any different if it's O1 or C1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| because the store is backing up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| It's going to be wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| It's going to be used the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| In terms of your big question about the buffer, I think the buffer is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| The buffer is gone because there are several parcels on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| that extend from Cedar to Shasta and have commercial development on them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| Whether it's zone commercial, one of them is on C1, one is on C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| The other one has an O1 piece, but it's a parking lot for a commercial establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| So effectively it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| My understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| is that the Weigels is actually going to be built, as Ms. Roddy said, on the C1-C3 line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2513)|
| 0:42:01| So we can't have the C1 section remain O1 and have this store built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| At some level, because it's already destroyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| what you'd do is you'd move the store, I guess, a couple feet closer to Cedar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| You wouldn't change the look from Shasta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| That kind of seems like a fight it's not worth having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| It's not worth making them redesign things, giving them less of a product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| just to provide some line that only shows up in a different color on a map in somebody's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| I think the key question now is what do we do about a buffer on Shasta?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| If we've assumed we've lost the north side, how do we protect the south side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| I think Mr. Donaldson has some ideas on that that I'd like to see pursued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| but especially how do we prevent the creep from going any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| I appreciate the questions. I think they're real valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| I'd like that there was more we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| Just in response to that real quickly, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| Councilman Pilo, will you allow me just to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Is that okay? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| Practically speaking, most of the commercial uses that are going to land there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| on the north side of Shasta between there and Cedar Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| are going to have to have that kind of depth to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| I think that's pretty evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Right now on the south side of Shasta, the corner lot on the corner of Shasta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| south side Shasta east of Central Avenue Pike is zoned 03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| and the rest, of course, is currently zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| That's something that we could look at, zoning it all office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| but I just don't know how long that's going to last because we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| over time, maybe see the same pressures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| I know my colleague wants to speak, so Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| I did want to make an observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| and that was the reason that I commented that it would have been so very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| for you to put something before us about the plan for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| Fully aware of the encroachment has already occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| and this is a marginal piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| but there is one aspect of it that really concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| because this is still single family, and that would be the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| I mean, you know, it's a bit different having some commercial establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| and having a, I assume there will be gas pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| I assume there will be full service at this Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Most of them are, and they're very attractive redeveloped properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| but generally they are located in an area where you are not going to be intruding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| on a neighborhood with your overhead lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| which of course is vital to the security and the safety of your establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| but I guess maybe that is my biggest concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| because I think we do have a responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| and I think Weigel's would have a responsibility to the area in which you are moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| and knowing that your establishment is going to be much more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| have much more impact on that neighborhood than many other commercial buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| that don't have that need for lighting and other activity of different hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| The outside lighting, of course, will be contained on the Cedar Lane side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| so good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| And basically the need for this is Weigel's position is they've got an existing store down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| It's very hard to get into that store with the railroad track right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| It's very unsafe, especially turning left to get out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| There's a traffic light that's installed from the Ingalls across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| This will provide a much safer place for this high-generating traffic place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| to be able to turn left on the Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| So they bought a couple of these lots many years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| in hopes that they would be able to move the store down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| and this other lot just came available recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| and so that necessitated the request for the rezoning now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| So they've built a very attractive store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| I think the lighting will be contained to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| There may be a small lot in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| I just have to really, in reality, differ with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| because, you know, we've had issues with parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| and the impact that lighting in a park, which is vital to the safety of the people who are using the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| has on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| I mean, the neighborhood I live in has that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| and that was going to be a huge impact to the properties next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| So while you contain it, it also is designed to give illumination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| which will disperse over the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| and I don't think you're going to be able to successfully prevent these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| that live over here on Chest and Fennell running that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| to be unaware of the intrusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| I guess a couple thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| I actually appreciate the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| I kind of thought I'd just sort of give a little oration here when we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I'm glad there's participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| and love to see the fellow council members taking such an interest in the fantastic 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:08| I wanted to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| One, I guess, Mr. Holquist, I think you've hit a big problem we've got that we're not dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| It's sort of the creep that we can make a decision now to keep this 01, deny the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| and down the road something's going to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| and I don't know what we do about that because we can come up with some good plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| I think we've got some, the MPC has some ideas about what should happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| but how you enforce that over a 20-year time as this develops gets to be a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| I wanted to actually ask Mr. Donaldson to talk a little bit about the idea of the south side of Shasta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| what to do with that, and how to make Shasta a better barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| and then maybe even talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| It sounds like there are some people who would like some more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| and maybe even talk about a postponement if you, Mr. Harbin, want to think about what that impact would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| But, Mr. Donaldson, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| With respect to the south side of Shasta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| we do see that as a transition area from the commercial activity on Cedar to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| starting with homes up front on Nueda, currently zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| We're about to kick off the process for our one-year plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| and we are going to suggest to folks that come out that we change the designation on the south side of Shasta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:28| to a mixed use for both moderate density residential and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| Based on our feeling that offices at that scale make a much better neighbor to residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:44| than does a multifamily project for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| They're occupied during the day when you want to have people in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| and folks tend to leave at night when you want it quiet in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| A lot of communities have had good success with using office as a buffer between commercial activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| and low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| So we're prepared to make that recommendation on the one-year plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| What's the schedule on the one-year plan update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Is there anything set yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Yeah, the meetings have been set, and I'm afraid that I don't have them memorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| About mid-February, I think, is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| They're posted on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| And February 14th, I think, is the one for the central, east, and north at Richard Oakley School in Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| I think starting at 6 or 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| I remember getting a notice about this, and it's not on my calendar yet, so I'm glad you were up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:48| Mr. Reynolds, do you have any thoughts about Mr. Holquist's sort of issue of long-term, how do we do this better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| Because it doesn't feel like we've done a good job here of saying, I think 15 years ago folks would have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| the buffer line is going to be the lot line between Cedar and Shasta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| We're going to have a barrier there, and that's fallen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| You make another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| What keeps it from changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Just any thoughts you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Well, I think that the nature of commercial development along Cedar, which is a significant arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| is that it demands a greater depth than just the half a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| We require folks to provide lots of parking, and we require them to do landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:32| and they're finding that they need more than 150 feet of depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| So in this case, they've started to encroach through the block to Shasta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| I think that's an appropriate place to draw the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| There should be a very hard line on the mid-block between Shasta and Nuada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| That neighborhood is fairly well organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| They have a very strong sense of where the edge of the neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Going back to something that Councilman Becker just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| I think on this side of the room there would be an appreciation for a motion to postpone for a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| so we can find out more and see the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| Let me ask, Mr. Hartman, is a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| My understanding is things are not moving quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Is that a problem for you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| I would be agreeable to two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I'd like to make a motion for a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Motion and second for a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| Any questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| If you could bring us just some great pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| I have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| I have no idea where they went before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Both the Marable site and then some drawings, maybe with color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| of what this site is going to look like and where the lighting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| and the landscaping and the ingress and egress and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| I think that would really help us to visualize how this is going to integrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| with backing up to the neighborhood on Shasta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| The motion and second is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to request the public building authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| of the County of Knox and the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| to perform project management services for the amphitheater renovation project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| under the agreement for project management services for designated projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| at a budgeted amount not to exceed $850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| for moving forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| The money is coming from something that I voted against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| but if you're going to take money from something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| this is a heck of a thing to put it towards, I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| You know, Doug McCarty has put a lot of time in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| and he's doing it for free, in which this city should be eternally grateful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| I know he's here to talk about the amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| This is a great thing that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| It will be returned to the use of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| and help accommodate some of the lost uses of the candy factory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| and I wholeheartedly support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| I'm going to, I guess, take the other side on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| because I don't necessarily think this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| It is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| It's about as much money as we spent about 10 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| in budget hearings last year fighting over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| and it doesn't bring it back to the original use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| All this does is fix a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| We can't actually have public performances here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| because it doesn't meet ADA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| We know from the workshop that's a whole lot more money to get after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| and I think we all know that even once we get it to that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| this is a facility that maybe can pay for itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| and I don't know that investing what sounds like could be as much as $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| in a facility that will continue to cost us money and not be very useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| Is that wise a decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Where is your investing $3 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Well, to get it ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| That's not part of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| That's not part of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Part of this proposal is we take the fence down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| I mean, it can be used for a rehearsal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| It can't be used for public performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| It's not bringing it back to what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| It certainly gets it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| It doesn't take $850,000 to $3 million to bring it back to ADA compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| So for folks wondering, ADA is not that expensive to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| That $3 million was putting in a sound system and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| Well, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Is that right, Mr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Well, that's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| It's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| I don't know if there's that much use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Yeah, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| I appreciate your effort to move forward what's been closed, condemned for 20, 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:08| and it doesn't reflect well on our city to go down to our World's Fair Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| and see a condemned area fence around it and weeds growing and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| But I really concur with a lot of what Councilman Becker said in the fact that $850,000 is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:28| And although I think that this landmark should be preserved in some shape, form, or fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:37| I'm not so sure that we know what we're fully getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| I think at best we should try to do what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| and that is take it from being a health, a safety, a risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| and remove the fence and bring it up to some sort of specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| But, you know, once you do that, I don't know what use the 99.9% of the public would have of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3357)|
| 0:56:06| And how do you run it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| And who uses it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| And how do you go about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| And as someone explained to me, you know, you do like you do the West Hills Gazebo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| But I think this certainly warrants, you know, more discussion and debate on what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:23| And if anything, I was prepared just to ask you to sort of move at a pace to see what we're getting into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| because if you take down that tent, is it going to break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| You know, what's it made out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| What are we really getting into, and what is our vision and goal really for the whole World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| which includes that amphitheater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| I've heard a lot of people come up and mention to me that maybe we could relocate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| and make it a fully utilized functioning asset someplace where we could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| enhance it and restore it back with the icon, the tent, maybe across the railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3412)|
| 0:57:00| where you could have Ashley Capps come in and we could really make it something that we could all be proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| that the convention center could use to market itself, that, you know, that this whole World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| there's only one of them here in Knoxville, and this is a great asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| And every day, as we're all working for downtown World's Fair Park, South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:25| all these assets, public and private, the value goes up every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| So I think this really, like Councilman Becker says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| it really warrants some discussion and some, you know, vision and some goals for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| I think Councilman Becker and Councilman Bader make some valid points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| I thought that was an interesting suggestion you just made, Councilman Bader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| with regards to the whole issue of the tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| It seems to me that, and I could be wrong, and I don't want to put any words into anyone's mouth on this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| or into any architect's mouth, but it seems to me that folk appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| and want to preserve the uniqueness and the flavor of that tent that is covering this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| And I just heard you suggest, you know, could it be moved possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| I remember when we were dealing with moving and putting over another area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| that makes for a more accessible area that could be used for public performances, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| which is an interesting thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| And cost-wise, you know, would that be cheaper overall than trying to bring this into ADA compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| as well as putting in the PA systems and those types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| to make it something that would be desirable for people to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| I do remember when we were dealing with the Smith Coughlin House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| and I made that suggestion then about the moving or moving the Smith Coughlin House to a better spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| and actually did a lot of research and saw where whole airport buildings were being moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| and all these things were being done to move edifices and structures and to preserve them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| so the technology is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| Right now, we don't have the Smith Coughlin House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Now, it would be some fault right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| I wish that maybe we would have thought a little more about the whole concept of moving that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| but that became a win-lose kind of struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| And I don't want us to have a win-lose kind of struggle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| And the suggestion about maybe dealing with or looking at or maybe looking at this issue from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| if we're really concerned about that tent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| is it a possibility to move that and develop or build another structure that it would be over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| that would be one that could be used for functions and performances and those types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| and what would that cost incur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| So I do have a concern, and I want to see it preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| That's why I had my law school graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| I like that tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| I thought it was very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| And I worked at the World's Fair site right there at the sale of souvenirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| and that's where I asked my wife out on our first date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| So, you know, it has that historic perspective for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| And I don't know if she thinks that was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| You know, some days she thinks it is, and I think some days she has her doubts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| Well, we're going to put a plaque there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| But my point is maybe this is an opportunity to kind of think out of the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| and take some time and think out of the box a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| and see what is our main goal here and what is our main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| And so I kind of have some reservations myself here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Councilwoman Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Well, it had been my intent, and that was a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| to see if I don't want to put Mr. McCarty on the spot, but he is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| and I would wonder if he would like to comment on some of the comments that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| and just what you see as the function for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| And, of course, you know, I'm one who wants to preserve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| but I would like for you to comment on, as an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Yes, I'm Doug McCarty, President of McCarty Holeshopper McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| I live on Knoxville 4019 to Wanda Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| It's been a good discussion already tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| and I understand there are some difficult issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| I guess when I read the article a few months ago about the different options that were being considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| I became sort of re-excited about the potential of saving the amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| I had talked to Bill about it, I guess, two or three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| and at the time there were a lot of things on all of our plates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| and it didn't seem to be the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| But since then, there's been some reconsideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| and I think PBA has done a very good job analyzing it with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| And the different proposals, I thought, were very intriguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| I mean, as I remember, the demolition costs, and Jeff, you'll correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| but the demolition cost was like approaching $600,000 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3713)|
| 1:02:01| And then there was the possibility of saving the tension structure for some $850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:11| And that also, I mean, in my opinion, I don't think it'll take $850,000 to fix the steel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:19| which is the main problem with the audience tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| The stage tent is really in pretty good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| There are two separate tent structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| So, you know, I'm guessing at this point, and there's been some estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| and Jeff probably is more on top of it than I am at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| but probably $600,000 would more than pay for fixing the steel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:45| and also painting a lot of the steel that obviously needs to be painted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| for the facility to look appropriate for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| So that will allow some monies, I don't know, $150,000 or $200,000, I'm hoping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| to help fix some of the other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Now, that wouldn't get into fixing all the AV systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| and it wouldn't solve all the ADA problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| It definitely wouldn't get into the underground building and fixing some of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| But I don't think there are huge ADA problems out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| And I think as part of what we can do, we can address some of those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:28| as it relates to ADA and seating and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| I guess my opinion also, for the $850,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| even though it won't be a performing amphitheater with all the sound and lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| of a very sophisticated performing arts center or amphitheater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| I think it will be appropriate for a lot of neighborhood gatherings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| Also, possibly for the convention center to use during nice weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| there could be informal meetings tied in with the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| So my opinion is that in more of a low-tech way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| it could become a very good gathering place for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| And there are so many different events that can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| that doesn't take a real sophisticated sound system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| Smaller groups, it's not a real big amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| So I think that kind of thing can happen over the next five to seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| And if during that time people can get more excited about really wanting an amphitheater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| that does have some of the more sophisticated sound systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| one at that time can make another decision as to whether more money needs to be put into a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:49| because one at that time wants an even better amphitheater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| than what we will have after this $850,000 expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| Thank you. Did you have a follow-up, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| I have one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| And this is probably just wild to ask you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| but there has been this comment about moving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Would you like to respond to that or would you prefer not to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| Well, I'll be glad to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| One thing about when I designed with the structural engineers the building back in the early 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| at that time there was about $400,000 of foundations under the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| to hold up the steel to hold up the tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| So if one had the same concept, there'd be more than a half million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| just putting foundations in the ground to hold up the tension structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| Also, even though the steel can be removed, because that's what we plan to do for the stage tent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| the fabric, even though it's in pretty good shape right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| you couldn't take it down and put it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| So you'd be talking about basically starting from scratch on the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| and I tend to think if you started from scratch, you'd be designing, it'd be a different structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| It might be one tent instead of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| It might need to cover more seats than we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| So it basically would be a brand new project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| I can't estimate what that would be, but it'd be well over the $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| that has been discussed in the study to renovate that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| It would be, I would guess, to have the sophistication that an amphitheater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| that really has all the audiovisual and all, it could be $5 to $7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| and I don't think at this point the will of the community is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| and that's why I sort of got excited about this other option that gives a good facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4005)|
| 1:06:53| without spending that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| I really appreciate the concerns that you bring up, Councilman Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| about wanting to know what we're getting ourselves into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| You know, I don't want this to be like the movie Home Improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| where it just is an endless pit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| I do think, though, that it's a good investment for the kind of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| that you were suggesting, that this is a public venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| public venue for conversation like the stuff that you and I are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| with the public conversations, Bob, public performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| There aren't very many places for theater groups to perform and practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:47| I think it could be just a wonderful asset for the World's Fair and for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| I also think that this idea of moving it, what I heard you say is that you really can't move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| You just have to try to rebuild something somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| Your design, you were thinking about the place when you designed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| It was a very custom design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| It was one of the centerpieces for the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| In as much as it is a custom design theater, that's why I wanted to preserve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:22| because it provides the kind of memory of the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| It's a compliment to the Sun Sphere, and I think it's a tremendous asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| I guess I actually thought I'd be sort of sitting alone on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| and that there actually is a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| One of the things I've learned in a couple of years on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| is sometimes it makes a lot of sense to postpone a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| that you don't have to make right away and let people think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| I'd like to make a motion for a two-week postponement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| There's a motion and a second to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| Only to the postponement at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Mr. Frost, is yours a different light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| I can make it this light too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I can adapt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| We've had a workshop on this issue where the different issues were laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| In the two years that I've served with Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| I know he's wont to often to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| we're not getting all the way there, and he does these hand gestures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| but this is a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| This is what we have right now, so I think we have a good opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| We have had a workshop, and I would like to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| I'm going to go with Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| I don't know who is next, but I'll go with Ms. Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| since I don't think she's spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| I concur with Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| I can't support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| I think we had a lengthy workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| We looked at a number of alternatives, some which were practical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| some which maybe were impractical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| but I feel like this is a good middle ground for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| Mr. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Councilman Becker, do you think if we do decide to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| if two weeks is a reasonable amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| that's not much time if we're going to do any further analysis or anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| Would it be better to go four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| I mean, my sense is if we need more time in two weeks, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| I'm generally a believer in a two-week postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| but I don't feel strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| If I could, could I just, and I won't take long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| but give kind of a one-minute review of how we got to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| When we came into office, we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| I don't think the whole World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| what we call the World's Fair Park assets were being fully utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| And we had some expensive parts to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| in that we own the candy factory and Victorian houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| which if you remember from our discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| we anticipated costing us about $10 million over the next 10 to 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| in upgrades due to ADA compliance and ongoing maintenance and operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| And we had a good, healthy discussion with some disagreement about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| but we had a discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| So that was one issue, and we ultimately made the decision to sell those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| I thought it was wrong to have the SunSphere closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| and I thought it was wrong to have the amphitheater fenced off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| And we, after a series of RFPs, came back with a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| and the SunSphere deal will come up later tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| With the amphitheater, we came back to, whenever that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| a month or two ago with the proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| I think we had three at the time, as I remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| and I might be wrong, so somebody correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| But one was for $300,000, $350,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| which basically entailed taking the roof off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| The other was for $600,000 to basically scrape it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| And the other was an estimate at $3 million to make it fully functional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| with everything from new bathrooms, ADA to PA system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| It was the full shebang to make it kind of a state-of-the-art performing amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| During that conversation, several members, I think maybe Mr. Hall suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| well, if the roof is what's unique, why don't we try to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| And then we came back and see what it would cost to save the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| but not make it fully functional, compliant, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| And that's where we came back with the $850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| It's really important to me, and the postponement we can live with, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| I mean, that's up to council to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| But it's important to me that we come up with a scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| that doesn't leave that fenced off and blocking the rest of the fair site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| And if the council decides they want to postpone, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| One other piece of news with all that, and we announced this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| Some of you all heard this and some didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| And it's not really germane to the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| but I'll throw it out as I've gone through the history list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| If you remember, with all this, we basically got about $1.8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| from the Candy Factory Victorian Houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| We're going to get a little, hopefully about $600,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| from the sale of the Poplar Street parking lot to Game Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| which comes up later, an issue related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| We've had some associated costs with all the moving around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| with putting people in the Emporium, setting up the new Fine Arts Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| But basically, when that's all said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| we're going to have more than enough to pay out of what we've sold here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| to pay for the Sun Sphere and the amphitheater renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| Enough so that two years ago in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| you all put $1 million in there for a Sun Sphere renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| and the proposal is to take that money back out of the World's Fair Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| and apply it to sidewalks out throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| As you all know, we have unlimited needs there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| and we could spend $10 million and still find $10 million more good to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| But it would be to take that million that you approved for capital on the Sun Sphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| two years ago and put that on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| So I just want to say that all in terms of background of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| The reason I seconded the motion for postponement is I just have a big concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| about going halfway on this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| If you remember in the workshops and the discussion we had, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| my whole vision was, and I even talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| if we're going to keep this and if we're going to preserve the ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| and utilize this, we should put it into a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| of where it could be utilized for helping the convention center draw people in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| be utilized as another venue in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| And I'm just not sure that right here what we have now does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| While we will preserve the tent and we're going to take the fence down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| but from what I hear there's still some issues here that we won't be able to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| for much more than if I want to go out and reminisce with my wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| and have a little picnic out under it, I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| You know, that's an expensive picnic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| So that's why, you know, I'm thinking the postponement makes sense to kind of talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| And Rob just mentioned this is a first start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Well, if it's a first step, has anybody thought about step two, three, four, and five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| And I appreciate what Damaris just said about dealing with sidewalks in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| and around schools and support that wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| I'm glad we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| But that's the reason I think maybe a postponement makes a little sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| so that even if this is step one, someone needs to be talking about step two, three, and four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| because hopefully our goal is going to be putting the thing back into use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| and not just let it be something we can drive by and look at for $850,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| but something that can be put back into use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| And that's just my concern, because if we're just putting it back into use for people to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| $850,000 could go a long way to more sidewalks or houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| or dealing with blight and plight in South Knoxville and in Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| and in East Knoxville and in North Knoxville and, well, West Knoxville, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| I don't want to say just blight and blight in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Somebody will call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| But I'm talking about those areas where I live and where I deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| So that's my underlying concern here, and I appreciate the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| And actually the administration coming back and trying to find a middle ground here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| But that's just my concern and why I would support the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| I'm going to go to Ms. Pelow, then Mr. Frost, then Mr. Becker, and then Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| Well, I just wanted to comment that I'm not going to support a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| for the reasons that have already been stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| but I asked Mr. McCarty to come and talk to us because his response was very clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:18| I don't believe that two weeks or four weeks is going to give me any more, any further information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| I really, you know, this goes back for some of us on council almost five years, over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:33| And I recall so hoping that a Bruce McCarty or someone would step up to do what he has offered to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:43| which is worth a lot of bucks to us as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| And I'm grateful for that opportunity because it seemed to me then it was the amphitheater was doomed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| if we did not have someone step up and offer to do as he has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| really a gift of his time and his resources and his capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| So in my mind, two weeks will not change my mind, nor will it help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| And I don't think another workshop would be the least bit helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| because I believe we understand what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| I, too, as Councilman Brown has so well stated, would like to see, you know, a more complete project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| I think Mr. McCarty gave us some sense of how we can phase toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| But I don't think two weeks is going to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| So I think we need to get in a position for that to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| And I think by making a decision, we will be closer to having those gaps filled in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| I thought one of the benefits of there was going to be economies of scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| or some economy savings by timing the construction of the amphitheater together with the sun sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:57| I think that is true in that they'll have a crane down there on the site at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| And Jeff or Dale or somebody, if I'm wrong, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| So there is some economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| I don't know if you can quantify that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| Jeff Gallion, live at 1624 Joe Hinton Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| Johnson and Gallion is the contractor that we would use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| There's a term contract out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| They have the contract on the sun sphere, and that work is getting ready to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| So we would anticipate using them at the same time, using the same superintendent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| all of the temporary facilities and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| So there would be some savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| Mr. Becker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Does two weeks make a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| No, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| The lights are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| Seeing no lights, are you ready to vote on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| Why don't you go ahead and call the roll, because I think it might be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Just to be clear, an aye means you want to postpone for two weeks, just so we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| It fails four to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| So now we're back to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Well, Mayor, having heard that, and I think it's a good discussion, I personally don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| see why we get in a hurry on these things that have been out there for 20 years or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| And I thought Mr. Brown made a very good point halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| I'd just like to ask you, as we move forward, that we move, you know, cautiously and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| we understand what we're getting into and that, you know, it's just a sort of pay-as-we-go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| sort of thing, because I envision other things coming along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| It's just obvious as daylight is to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| And, you know, I want to make that, you know, the best place we possibly can for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| because I think it's a great tool for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| And our convention center's there, and I think, you know, we've got a grand opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| do some great things around the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| So I just ask you to move cautiously and optimistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| And we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| I agree with Councilman Becker that $850,000 is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| And I agree with Councilman Bailey that this is halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| But I think halfway is the best consensus-driven solution that we've come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| When the mayor reminded us of the three options that we looked at at the workshop, and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| three options did not include this option, you know, there was take the roof off, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| was level it, and there was fix it fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| Well, I don't think we can afford to fix it fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| So I was down to level it or take the roof off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| And I was the one that said that, for me, taking the roof off wasn't a solution because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| everybody's love of this structure, you know, I use the word iconic, is the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| That is the symbol of the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| And so, to me, this solution, which isn't a whole lot more percentage-wise than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| cost of leveling it, and it preserves the roof, gives you that, you know, that feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| of having this World's Fair icon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| It is an icon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| As Mark Brown said, you know, it may be a place where you go and have a picnic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| It's like preserving a statue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| I should have said Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| You know, it's like the statue of Rachmaninoff that's on the World's Fair site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| It's something that's symbolic of our community and of our past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| And if we feel as a community we want to preserve it, then that's how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| But it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| It's going to be like a statue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| And it will be usable in some capacities, but not as much as it was then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| But I'm personally not willing to approve the $3 million in funds that it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| to make it fully usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| And I would prefer not to have to level it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| If it only costs $200,000 more to keep the roof than level it, then to me that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| best solution at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| So I plan to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| I think just in response, I think my recollection is the cheapest option was just to take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| roof off over the stands, leave the stage there, leave the stage covered, which gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| us, I think it doesn't give us the iconic feel with the roof, it gives us the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| And that was about $350,000, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| That was a fairly inexpensive option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| And I'm, I mean, I do, we talked for a long time about $850,000 in the last budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| You know, a couple months from now we're going to be having discussions again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| I don't know that this is the right tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| So I'm actually going to be voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| I'd like to see, I'd actually like to see us go with the option, the cheaper option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| that gives us a public space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Barring that, I actually kind of agree with Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| If we're going to fix it up, let's fix it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| Mr. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| Well, I voted for the postponement because I felt like there were enough unanswered questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| still in terms of, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| I agree with Councilman Marotti that it's probably not an unreasonable expenditure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| spend an extra $200,000 or so over the cost of demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| I think it's sort of like incremental decisions such as rezoning, the rezoning we just dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Once we make that commitment, we probably are committing ourselves down the road to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| more expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| I don't think, I don't know that we'll see it as satisfactory over a period of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| to leave it at this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| But I can see us feeling some real pressure to take it on, as Councilman Brown said too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| So I'm a little concerned about that, but I'm going to vote for this because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| it's a reasonable step to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| But I want to caution the rest of Council that I don't know that this will be the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| decision we'll have to make on the amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Give me a second if you'd call the roll again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| I'm sorry, this is for the approval of 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| An aye is a vote to approve 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| Motion carries six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| 11C is a resolution approving a lease agreement between the City of Knoxville and Sunsphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| KPH LLC for the lease of portions of the Sunsphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| Right now, no one signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| There is one person signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| I'll go ahead and take the person who signed up to speak against, and if someone is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| the audience that's in favor, they can come back after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| David Buckwalter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:21| I'm David Buckwalter, 813 Maplehurst Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| It would be helpful to hear what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| I know that things are in flux, and I'm not really clear on what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| I think that's fair, and with Council's permission, I'd like to ask whoever wants to represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| Kenzie Provasco-Hayes to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:45| Just as a way of reminder, Kenzie Provasco-Hayes was the, I guess, winning bidder on the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| for the Candy Factory and Victorian Houses, and a proposal on the Sunsphere was part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| This has taken a lot longer to work out for various reasons, but if you'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| Mr. Mayor, members of Council, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| My name is John Kinsey, and as we reviewed the Sunsphere, which, by the way, we did respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:13| to an RFP actually in 2004, what we're here to talk about tonight is exactly what we proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:22| at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Just as we spent a good bit of time about four months ago at the workshop, our intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| and I've got Mr. Bob Sukenik is here, and, of course, he made a presentation at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| He will be taking two floors and having a restaurant facility and be available for catering events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5198)|
| 1:26:49| I will tell you that Mr. Sukenik has told me that since the workshop that he's been getting a lot of calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| wanting to know when people can start getting back into the Sunsphere, and they're really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| The upper two floors will be office use, and we're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| I think that the Mayor heard everyone say, let's get City Council involved on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:18| which is why we came to the workshop and had a clear understanding that what Council wanted to see happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:28| and that is what Mr. Kaiser has made sure is in the lease agreement that is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| I'll ask Mayor Kinsey a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Today I was able to go up onto the fourth floor observation deck, and there were the little, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| stations around there that showed what you were looking out upon during the time of the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| Do those exist on the other floors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| I mean, wasn't there an observation deck on the top as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| We might let Dale Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| PVA has been managing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| They're only on the fourth floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| So the ones on the fourth floor will be, I mean, those will be preserved, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Including the picture of his predecessor and family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| I have a concern I'd like to express and also a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| Along the same lines with the amphitheater, you know, the Sun Sphere is probably the most identifiable, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:28| symbol that Knoxville has, and every day our assets go up, like I said earlier, public and private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| and I think the World's Fair site and the Sun Sphere, the potential is phenomenal in the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:43| I've had discussions, and I appreciate the hard work on behalf of Kenzie Provasco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| and the process leading up to this, and I've had discussions with them on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| and other folks around town that in the near future there may be something that would be a bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5334)|
| 1:29:05| and better and higher use of the Sun Sphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| and I know Brian Connolly and Kenzie Provasco, their hearts are in the right place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| and I know they want to do the right thing for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| and so I would like to suggest, recommend to the administration that we work out some sort of clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:22| some language that would be suitable to both parties that would give the city sort of an out clause down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| if something that was good for the whole, the mass of the people, for the city, for the public that would come along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| that we might have some recourse with Kenzie Provasco in some sort of a sublease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| or a release, lack of a better word, that would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| allow us to have some sort of a better use of the Sun Sphere in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| Thanks. Mr. Kenzie, do you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| Well, you know, that's one of the things that municipal governments have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| is they always have the right to take something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| You know, so that out clause is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| You know, I'm not sure how we could, I mean, certainly if there's something that comes along in the very near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5407)|
| 1:30:15| as things are, you know, we'd love to see the most maximum use there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| but if it is three years down the road or six years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| I'm not sure how to structure an out clause at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| I think one of the issues, I think, from Kenzie Provasco's standpoint is they put dollars in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| making sure that they protect those dollars invested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| but I think it's fair to say from the beginning you all didn't get all into this to run the Sun Sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| It was part of your entire bid, and so because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| I don't think they've based all their decisions around running the Sun Sphere for the rest of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| Yeah, and we would love to see, you know, if there's something better to look at in the near term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| you know, we certainly would like to play a role in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| and would be anxious to try and work with you on that through the weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| And I've talked to members of your party, and I hear that clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| and I just wanted to ask the administration to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| to work out something that everyone's comfortable with, whether it's a 12-, 15-, 18-month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| where they, you know, you redo it in case something comes along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| or, you know, with some monies for, you know, money that's gone into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| something I know it can be worked out, so I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| Mr. Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Well, Mr. Kinsey, of course, being a former mayor, I'm sure he has a pretty good idea about the local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| or municipal government having the power to take things back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| Of course, we would be in a contract with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| and would be subject to the provisions of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| But I think what I hear you saying sounds very reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| and I think that if something does come along, that all the parties say, hey, this is a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| I mean, if all the signatories to an agreement agree, then they can all agree to amend the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| It's just not that big a deal at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| We'd be excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Seeing none, are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| Mr. Buchwald, did you want to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| Did you get your question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| Yes, I got my question answered, and I'd still like to say a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Please, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| I guess there's a lot that could be said and maybe some things that shouldn't be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| I've thought a lot about what I need to say tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| and I took a little walk today, and I walked down to the Victorian houses and looked around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| and it didn't appear to me that anything has changed in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| They seem to still be in the same condition and the same use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| One of them, looking in the windows, seemed to be used for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| A couple of them just were empty, and I actually helped an artist friend move out of one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| and where she was, it looks just like the day I helped her move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| So I don't know whether that's a big deal or not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| I did hear some rumors a year ago that these properties were blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| so maybe the city might think about taking them back at some point if they remain blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:27| And then I walked down to the Emporium, and I guess I think this ought to be of particular interest to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| since you all voted a second time to hold these developers to an agreement that they made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:42| and there's nothing been done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| There's absolutely nothing been done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| And I don't know what more to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| I mean, there's a lot more I could say, and I appreciate Councilman Bailey's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| in making sure that something really befitting the stature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| and living up to the potentials of what's there is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| I'm really disappointed the city didn't reach higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| and didn't engage the community and challenge and provide the leadership for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| to do something really, really exciting and meaningful with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| And I think it's good that it be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| In a sense, I'm not exactly opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| I just have some disappointments, and I have some questions about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| whether these developers have lived up to obligations that have been before them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| and if that's something you all need to talk about or think about as you make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Mr. Kinsey, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| I would just like to address where we are on the Emporium and the Candy Factory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| and the Victorian houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| Of course, the Candy Factory is well under construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| and we actually have sold all the units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| and actually have made sure that the South's Finest Chocolate will always be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| because they also have that under contract to purchase their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| We were asked at one point to, rather than us do the work at the Emporium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:14| to give $200,000 toward that effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| and then we were asked, well, no, you all go do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| So we have been ready since September 15th to get a building permit to start that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:30| But, you know, there's three parties involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| and the city and the owner of the building have had issues to work through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| which has been resolved, and we actually did start work there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| But we've been ready for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| And, of course, the Emporium is tied into the Victorian houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| because until that work is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| we are restricted on what we can do on the Victorian houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| So we are anxious to get going on those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| Mayor, I just want to say in conclusion that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| I really applaud all the work and effort that's gone in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| and for you and your administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| and for everybody getting these projects off the dime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| because it's been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| And I sat around today in different places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| and heard the news and the buzz around town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| and people are really excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| So I think it's a good start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| and I appreciate you entertaining the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| and working with these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| and look forward to bigger and better things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Any other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| 7D is a resolution approving a First Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| to the Development Agreement with Game Day Centers Southeastern LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| for the purchase and development of attractive real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| located at the intersection of Cumberland Avenue and Poplar Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| I guess this would be Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| I think Bill can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| They just stated or the description here states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| that it's just the access to the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| it's always in use, et cetera, because of the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| Is there any way that we know that that's going to get better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| or they're going to have enough time and access to do this in the 90-day extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| Yes, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| What we had is during the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| the convention center had a lot of things scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| and had not been given notice that the folks needed to get on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| and now that we've gotten into the period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| they've made one series of core drillings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| They will need to go back again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| but the convention center folks are aware of that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| and we can work that schedule out, so I think we can proceed without any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5869)|

| 1:39:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| Vice Mayor Brown, there are some folks signed up, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| However you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| I'll start, and I'm sure I'll have something to say after they're heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| We're heading now to what I was alluding to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| Let me tell you, in just sitting here listening a few minutes ago with regards to the amphitheater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:43| and we kind of came to a juncture where folks just basically said we found a halfway point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| and maybe we're halfway and maybe this makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| And that may make sense with a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| but what I'm going to ask this council to do as we listen to everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| is we do not need to go halfway when it comes to the lives of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| and improving their lot in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| Right now we're going to consider a contract that's only a small part of the empowerment zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| and dealing with all those issues as it relates to the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| Halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| Without a plan on how we're going to go the rest of the way with regards to governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| with regards to the P&I board or the empowerment zone board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| with regards to what Roe Coyne plays in that, with regards to how we're going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:31| I think it is very important, and we have a golden opportunity now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| to actually fashion where we go forward in a holistic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| Right now, quite frankly, I think it's much like going into a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| and say you want to order soup and they tell you, well, all I know is water is in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| but we don't know what else is coming down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| If you're going to order it with just water and potatoes, you don't know what else is coming down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| I want to make sure I know what's all on the menu, what's all in the soup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| I do not want us to go halfway in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| Now, we all the time deal with contracts piecemeal and we do a contract for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| and we've got another one that comes on for this and another one comes on for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| but the empowerment zone is so important and these pieces are so intertwined that after we hear from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:18| and then I'll come back and speak again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| I think we need to think very carefully about taking this step without knowing a couple of basic questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| Who's going to be responsible for dealing with this contract as it relates to compliance with the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:33| We've got a contract here that doesn't have the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| How are we breaking down the budget here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| We've got a contract here that talks about 90 days to lay out the goals and objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| We're going to approve a contract without the goals and objectives in it, without a budget here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| without knowing who's going to hold the Urban League responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| and how they're going to hold them responsible for the duties that are yet to be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| We've got a situation where we've got what's going to be involved in the P&I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| what's going to be the role of their board, how they're going to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| who's going to sit down and monitor this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| Are we sure that it's appropriate for the empowerment zone's loan fund to be put under Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:12| or is it more important to make sure we contract with the Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| for all those supportive services that they're talking about doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| and that the empowerment zone's loan fund stand on its own as it has done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| It is probably, and I'm going to propose and suggest that it is probably cost us less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| to leave the status quo than it will be to move it currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| and that will put more money out there into the community, into the lives of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| So I look forward to hearing from everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| but I've got some suggestions specifically on the loan fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| and how maybe we can save a little money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| and I hope we take a hard look at this and not decide today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| well, we're going to go halfway and this is good enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| and hope down the line everything else falls into line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| Mr. Martin and Mr. Howard, would you like to speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| If that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| I certainly appreciate the opportunity to take just a few minutes to frame for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| the rationale of our resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| I'm sure we'll have full discussion of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| and in the course of my comments you'll get a flavor of, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| the rationale for the resolution tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| and then Madeline will speak to the details of what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| As council is fully aware and Vice Mayor Brown has talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| the empowerment zone designation for Knoxville ends on December 31, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| So it's incumbent upon the city and all of us to make sure that we're utilizing the empowerment zone dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| that are available to us, that we're deploying those in the best active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| and working programs and projects that we can propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| One of our priorities over the next three years is the empowerment zone small business loan fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:06| We have available for that fund, there's funds that are already lent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| but we have in addition to that close to around $3 million of lendable funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| We have both a short-term and long-term objective to our resolution tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| Our short-term objective is to implement a viable lending program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| that gets the dollars working in small businesses within the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| This can be startup businesses or the expansion of existing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| all of which are aimed at job and wealth creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| Our long-term objective is to have built by December 31, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| a viable small business loan program that is self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| And the key here is to try to get it to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| where it is not dependent upon empowerment zone administration dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| because, again, the designation ends at the end of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:07| With these two objectives in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| we have over the last two and a half months looked at the best approach to our opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:15| We quickly determined that bringing the loan fund in-house to the city was not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| The city does not have the skills or relationships needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| and it did not fit our core competencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| We considered continuing to transition P&I into such an implementing entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6330)|
| 1:45:38| While we greatly appreciate P&I stepping forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| and helping the city at the city's request to take responsibility for the loan fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| when the EVI ceased to exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| we did not believe that long-term this was the best role for P&I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| the best role for them to serve in regard to the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| Given the limited time left in the empowerment zone designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| we strongly felt that P&I should continue to serve in its governance role for the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:15| and that given that, there would be an inherent conflict for them to serve both in the governance role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| and to be an implementer of the loan fund beyond an interim basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| And we have heard Vice Mayor Brown in regard to his concerns about the P&I board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:35| the representation on the P&I board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| and making sure that the P&I board does reflect the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| and his points are well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| I will tell you that the prospectus for the empowerment zone speaks to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| It speaks to low-mod income neighborhoods being represented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| The P&I bylaws themselves speak to that point as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| And we can elaborate later, but we've had discussion with P&I leadership in regard to the city's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:08| about making sure the P&I board reflects the low-to-moderate income neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| that are affected in the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| We looked for an entity that could be the implementer for us for the empowerment zone small business loan fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:27| and we considered these attributes, that that entity be located in the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| that it have an economic development focus, that it have a proven track record of success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| that it have a diverse board providing strong oversight and governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| that it have good leadership at the executive director level, and it has staff capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| We wanted an entity that was financially strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| and we wanted an entity that had resources and programs beyond just this empowerment zone small business loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6474)|
| 1:48:03| We feel strongly that we have found those attributes in the Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| The Knoxville Area Urban League has been in existence in Knoxville since 1968.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| Nationally, the Urban League has been an entity since 1910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| So we're proposing that the empowerment zone small business loan fund, and that's a key,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| and another, quite frankly, help from Vice Mayor Brown for us to make sure that we branded this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| that we call this loan fund what the loan fund is, which is the empowerment zone small business loan fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:39| We're proposing that it be managed by the Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| We've had experience with the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| The Urban League, for example, has provided support programs for our affordable housing trust fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:52| which has worked very well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| We approached the Urban League in late November about the empowerment zone small business loan fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| In fact, it was just a few days prior to the council's workshop on the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:07| They were receptive but cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| They wanted to make sure they understood what the city was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| They wanted to understand why the city was moving from PNI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| and they wanted to understand where the city was headed with community development in the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| Equally important, they wanted to understand the components of the loan fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| and they wanted to make sure they could fulfill those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| They went about this very carefully and exercised good due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| The board of the Urban League prior to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| and this is an important point to make here, that prior to the city approaching them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| the Urban League board had made a strategic decision to move more heavily into economic development activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:54| To that end, they recently hired Sherman Jones to be vice president for administration and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| and Dr. Jones brings extensive financial experience to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| The importance of this is that our then approaching them about the empowerment zone loan program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| fit very well with their strategic decision by the board to really focus on economic development activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6611)|
| 1:50:20| A week ago tonight, we presented our empowerment zone small business loan fund plan to PNI in their role as governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:32| I can tell you that we had a spirited discussion over an hour and a half, and as you read in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:42| it did pass the PNI board with one dissenting vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| So what we're bringing to council tonight is the formal approval of the PNI board again in its role of governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:56| And I'm going to stop at this point and ask Madeline just to give you a flavor, and it's very brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| a flavor of the specifics, if you will, of what we're proposing, and then we can respond to questions at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:08| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| The contract that you have before you is a one-year contract that can be renewed annually based upon performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:18| with a 30-day cancellation by either party with or without cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| As Mr. Martin already alluded to, the loan fund will be marketed as the empowerment zone small business loan program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:31| managed by the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| The loan fund has its own identity in this way and yet is also still who is accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:39| An extensive marketing plan will be developed to make sure that we reach the target audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:45| for whom these funds are targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| The existing loan officer, it is proposed that the existing loan officer that is right now with PNI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:57| that he would move over and become to the Urban League, move across the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| and would become an Urban League employee, and he would bring his files, his computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| his list of current and prospective loans, and he would be in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:13| And being in that office, we think a real strength is that he then has access to the receptionist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| the clerical support, the accounting, the accountant, the program staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| and their computer and training facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| It adds a lot of value to the existing loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| In addition, as already been mentioned, there will be strong staff support to oversee his work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| and to help develop this program into an effective loan program with the addition of the Vice President| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:44| for Administration and Development, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| As Larry mentioned, he has an impressive background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| including an MBA from the Harvard Business School and a doctorate in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| He's had a career as an educator, a college administrator, a financial advisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| and a management consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| We're proposing a loan committee that will be appointed that will review loan applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:09| recommended by the loan officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| and this loan committee would have the final authority to make the loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| The loan committee would be appointed by the Urban League Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| in consultation with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| and we are developing a profile for membership on the loan committee similar to what Vice Mayor Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:30| has suggested in his document tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| And it would likely include people such as local bankers and lenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| easy residents and business owners, and a city representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| That is still to be determined, but these are some categories that would be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| Both the Urban League and the city invite referrals of qualified individuals to fill these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:53| But ultimately, the Board of Directors of the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| it is our proposal that they would make the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| and therefore, because they are ultimately accountable for the implementation of this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| yet remember that the loan committee would be the final authority to make the loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| not the Urban League Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| Within 90 days, the city and the Urban League will enter into an amendment to this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| that establishes performance criteria under which the Urban League's performance will be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| This will be done after researching the best practices in the field of microenterprise lending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| in order to develop realistic expectations based on successful national models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:37| It's very important that we agree on the front end what success looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| in order to fairly evaluate the outcomes of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| and I think that's something that may have suffered in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| There's been a lot of disagreement on what was success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| and what wasn't with the prior loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| We know that there are the Urban League itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| Several Urban Leagues in other cities have microenterprise loan programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| so the Urban League can tap into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| as well as we know that there are other empowerment zone loan funds like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| and there's National Association of Microenterprise Lenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| That's not exactly the name, but there are standard practices that have been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| and best practices that we can learn from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| Utilizing the Urban League staff, contracted services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| and in collaboration with other technical assistance providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| such as the Tennessee Small Business Development Center, SCORE, and the SBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| this program, the loan program, will provide support services to potential loan applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| including advice in creating business plans, preparing loan applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| credit repair counseling, financial management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| There will also be post-financing business support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| ongoing technical assistance such as one-on-one counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| and group workshops on topics such as financial projections, business taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| bookkeeping and accounting, human resources, inventory management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| whatever it is needed, again, through either these contracted services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| existing staff, or the use of the other agencies in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| We don't intend to reinvent any wheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| The Urban League will provide the administration and collection services related to all EZ loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:20| including our existing portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| The first-year operating costs are $265,000, which is comparable to the last budget for EVI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:31| And that is an overview of what we are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| Vice Mayor Brown, would you like to go now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| Yes, Mr. Mayor, just very quickly because I appreciate, let me say also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| I appreciate all the meetings we've had, Larry and Madeline and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| and others who have been in meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| We've agreed to disagree and walk away still shaking hands and being friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| and we do agree on several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| You know, the need for the P&I loan for the P&I board, that's what it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7014)|
| 1:57:01| to be representative of the community, and we agree on a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| I agree, and I want to make sure it's very clear because in what Larry has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| and in Madeline's presentation, it almost implies that I am questioning the capabilities of the Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7030)|
| 1:57:18| to deliver on the business support training activities that they are going to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:24| And I said earlier that I think we should do a separate contract with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| and use the expertise of Mr. Jones and the Urban League network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| You know, I'm an Urban Leaguer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| You know, we used to say when I was there once an Urban Leaguer, always an Urban Leaguer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| I guess to a degree, maybe the board and the board chair right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| and the executive director may question that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| but my concern is not with regards to their capability of doing those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| I have a legitimate, what I feel is a legitimate concern with regards to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| or not we need to just move Mr. Felix Harris and the EZ Loan Fund across the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| and put it under Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| I'm glad to hear that we've come to basically an understanding that we think it's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| that it should be branded the EZ Loan Fund so that people see it as a stand-alone loan fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| You know, if you will reflect back, because I want to make sure I'm not misquoted or misunderstood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| when we had the workshop the end of November and the first council meeting to talk about this in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| I applauded Mr. Harris and also King Pernell for what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7101)|
| 1:58:29| Actually, I advocated that we should let them keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| You know, if you really think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| I was one of the people who said, hey, they're getting money in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| They're actually making loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| They've got some in the pipeline, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| But we voted to kind of cut all that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| So I want to make it real clear that I'm not questioning his ability from that end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| or the Urban League's ability from their end with regards to business training and staff activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| I do think that there is an inherent value that we can save money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| with leaving the Empowerment Zone Loan Fund at its current rent-free position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| where it is, over in the Amstaff Bank, right across the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| They're sharing a parking lot there, the staff that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| And also in my proposal, if you will note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| I think we have a great opportunity to make this a more partnership situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| to maybe even save his salary, if it's going to be Mr. Harris, and I hope it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7154)|
| 1:59:20| and his support staff salary by reaching out to the, and I'm mentioning this to Mr. Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| and also to Matt, and reaching out to the financial institutions in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| You know, the large financial institutions in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| hey, as part of your CRA commitment to supporting the Empowerment Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| and the business support with what the Urban League is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| you guys can step up and agree to every year help to fund that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| You know, put $10,000 a year or $15,000 a year from you have millions of dollars you spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| on making sure we get good ballet and we have Bill Cosby here and we do all sorts of fundraisers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:55| but here's an opportunity where you guys can commit to your CRA programmatic activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| to carry the funding for the position and also his support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| What would that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Those dollars then go back out to either help the Urban League in its capacity building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| or right back out into the community, and also it lets the banks get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| There's another opportunity of maybe having the banks help us with loan executives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| We've got an opportunity here to really think about what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| and trying to get a lot of people involved here and still do all the contracting with the Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| for all the business and technical services and the great Urban League network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| There are Urban Leagues that run small business loan centers, et cetera, across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| but we've got an opportunity now to go ahead and take our time and move forward here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| So I want to make sure before this debate continues that people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| Mark Brown is not against the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Mark Brown is not saying the Urban League can't do what it needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| Mark Brown is saying we can have the Urban League piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| and still have an even better stand-alone loan fund that is operational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| that the community understands, hey, this is a loan fund, stand-alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| that is an Empowerment Zone loan fund, and I don't see any compelling reason for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7262)|
| 2:01:08| and this is where we disagree, where Larry and I disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| and Matt and I disagree, any compelling reason to move them across the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| But I do see a compelling reason in leaving them where they are and saving that rent money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| saving some of that utility money, some of those costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| as well as in exploring, there's no guarantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| and Larry has told me that there will probably be concerns from the financial institutions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| is this the best way for them to comply with CRA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| but this gives us a compelling opportunity together to go hand in hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| this council, this administration, the Urban League, the P&I, the Empowerment Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| and say to the businesses and the bank sector, hey, you guys can be a viable partner here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| So there's a lot of other issues out there that we're not looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| that by moving very hastily here, you know, we could be only going halfway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| and that's why ultimately, so no one will mistake me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| I'm going to ultimately ask for at least a 30-day extension on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| so that we can continue these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| And as Ms. Rojero just alluded to, there are going to be 90 days for them to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| and deal with the performance measures, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| and if you're going to have 90 days left of performance measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| 30 days to kind of explore some of these other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| and how we deal with the board makeup of P&I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| and making sure that we have representation from the geographic areas of each ZAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:27| and how that can be appointed and how that can happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| that we come together and have a complete package on how we're going to move forward to empower people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| So that's what this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| and making sure that we get as many of those dollars out there to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| So I know there's a lot of people that want to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| and I look forward to hearing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| and I have some specific questions even about the contract when we get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Thank you very much, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| Signed up to speak are Deborah Porter, Dennis Upton, and Thomas, I think it's Tally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:55| Okay. Deborah, you're first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7375)|
| 2:03:05| Deborah, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| Good evening, Council and Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| I'm Deborah Porter, 1726 North Hills Boulevard, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| Approximately one month and a half ago, I stood before you to give you a synopsis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| of how I viewed the EZ, P&I, and other inequities within the EZ dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| And again tonight, I find myself in the same space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| not to discuss the P&I but to discuss the EZ loan fund dollars that remain to be disbursed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| or loaned to the business or prospective businesses that are located in the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7417)|
| 2:03:43| or want to locate in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| As I meditated over the many meetings that I have attended over the last few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| regarding the Urban League and its role in the loan fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| I decided that it was not so much about who distributes the loan fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| even though that is an important aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| but how and when those loan dollars would get out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| As you've already heard tonight from Madeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| it would be at least another 90 days before things would be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| It is my understanding that there is about $600,000 in applications for the loan dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| but I am concerned whether half or any of those applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| will be awarded any dollars anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| And the reason that I have that concern, and as one P&I board member put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| and have a heavy heart regarding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| is because of the downtime associated with the loan fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| Councilman Woodall, as I told you a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| I have a history with the EZ and the loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| I have worked for the Tennessee Small Business Development Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| and been the business development officer with the TSBDC with the Empowerment Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:55| And as the business development specialist during 2001 to 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| I realized for many of the years that there was not an executive director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| and this is just a little bit of history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| and therefore there was not a loan officer at one particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| And with those positions at one point being filled, the money still did not get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:18| Then additionally, a few years later, we find that funds did get out for the EZ businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:26| and then there was a bad loan portfolio, as some would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| And when the loans did not get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| then there were people who did not want to approve the loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| And next we have a loan officer coming into a situation who could not loan EZ dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:42| and therefore because of different extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| So even all this, even the history is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| And I was there, and it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| So imagine what it is for somebody else, or even some of you all for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| And now the loan fund goes to another agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycounciljan3007d1?start=7557)|
